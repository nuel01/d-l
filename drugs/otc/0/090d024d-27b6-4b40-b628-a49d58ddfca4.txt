When a dose of XENPOZYME is missed , refer to Table 3 .
Follow the instructions in the " Escalation Phase " or " Maintenance Phase " depending on which phase the patient misses the dose .
Table 3 : Dosing Recommendations for XENPOZYME Missed Doses [ 1 ] Consecutive Missed Doses In : Escalation Phase Maintenance Phase 1 missed dose • First dose after a missed dose : Administer last tolerated dose • Second and subsequent doses after missed dose : Resume dose escalation at next infusion according to Table 1 for adult patients or Table 2 for pediatric patients First and subsequent doses after missed dose : Administer maintenance dose 2 consecutive missed doses • First dose after missed dose : Administer 1 dose below last tolerated dose • Second and subsequent doses after missed dose : Resume dose escalation according to Table 1 for adults or Table 2 for pediatric patients • First dose after missed dose : Administer 1 dose below the maintenance dose • Second and subsequent doses after missed dose : Resume the maintenance dose 3 or more consecutive missed doses First and subsequent doses after missed doses : Resume dose escalation at 0 . 3 mg / kg and follow Table 1 for adults or Table 2 for pediatric patients First and subsequent doses after missed doses : Restart dosing at 0 . 3 mg / kg and follow Table 1 for adult patients or Table 2 for pediatric patients [ 1 ] At scheduled infusion after a missed dose , if the dose administered is 0 . 3 or 0 . 6 mg / kg , administer that dose twice as per Table 1 and 2 .
2 . 5 Dosage and Administration Modifications and Monitoring • In the event of a severe hypersensitivity reaction ( e . g . , anaphylaxis ) or a severe infusion - associated reaction ( IAR ) , immediately discontinue XENPOZYME administration and initiate appropriate medical treatment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
• In the event of a mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction or a mild to moderate IAR , consider temporarily holding or slowing the infusion rate , and / or reducing the XENPOZYME dose .
If dose is reduced , re - escalate following dose escalation described in Tables 1 and 2 for adult and pediatric patients , respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
• If transaminase levels are elevated above baseline and > 2 times the ULN prior to the next scheduled administration , the XENPOZYME dose can be adjusted ( prior dose repeated or reduced ) or treatment can be temporarily withheld until the liver transaminases return to the patient ' s baseline value [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 6 Preparation Instructions Use aseptic technique during preparation .
Reconstitute and dilute XENPOZYME in the following manner : Reconstitution and Dilution Instructions • 1 .
Determine the number of XENPOZYME vials to be reconstituted based on the calculated dose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
• 2 .
Remove XENPOZYME vials from refrigeration and set aside for approximately 20 to 30 minutes to allow vials to reach room temperature .
• 3 .
Reconstitute each vial with 5 . 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection , USP by directing the diluent flow to the inside wall of the vial to avoid foaming .
• 4 .
Gently roll and tilt vial ( s ) to reconstitute XENPOZYME and avoid foaming .
Each reconstituted vial will yield a 4 mg / mL clear , colorless solution .
• 5 .
Visually inspect the reconstituted solution in the vials for particulate matter and discoloration .
The solution should be clear and colorless .
Discard if the solution is discolored or if visible particulate matter is present .
• 6 .
Withdraw the required volume of XENPOZYME from the vial ( s ) and dilute the XENPOZYME solution for infusion with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in a syringe or infusion bag depending on the volume of infusion ( see Table 4 ) .
• For patients who weigh less than 10 kg receiving 0 . 03 mg / kg and 0 . 1 mg / kg and patients who weigh between 10 to 20 kg receiving 0 . 03 mg / kg dose , the volume of infusion will vary to achieve a fixed final concentration of 0 . 1 mg / mL ( see Table 4 ) .
Prepare the required dose diluted to a final concentration of 0 . 1 mg / mL in a syringe for infusion .
• For all other patient weights and doses , the final concentration will vary to achieve a fixed total volume ( see Table 4 ) .
• - For total volume less than or equal to 20 mL prepare a syringe for infusion : • Inject the required volume of the reconstituted XENPOZYME solution ( 4 mg / mL ) from step 3 slowly down the inside wall of the syringe .
• Add slowly the quantity sufficient of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP to obtain the required total infusion volume ( avoid foaming within the syringe ) .
• - For a total volume of greater than or equal to 50 mL prepare an infusion bag : • Add slowly the required volume of the reconstituted XENPOZYME solution ( 4 mg / mL ) from step 3 into the appropriate size 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP infusion bag ( avoid foaming within the bag ) to achieve a fixed total volume per Table 4 .
• 7 .
Gently invert the syringe or the infusion bag to mix .
Do not shake .
Because this is a protein solution , slight flocculation ( described as thin translucent fibers ) occurs occasionally after dilution .
• 8 .
Vials are for single dose only .
Discard any unused solution .
Storage and Handling of the Reconstituted and Diluted Solutions • If the reconstituted XENPOZYME vials are not used immediately , store refrigerated at 2 ° C to 8 ° C ( 36 ° F to 46 ° F ) for up to 24 hours or at room temperature at 20 ° C to 25 ° C ( 68 ° F to 77 ° F ) for up to 12 hours .
• If the diluted solution is not administered immediately , store refrigerated at 2 ° C to 8 ° C ( 36 ° F to 46 ° F ) for up to 24 hours or at room temperature at 20 ° C to 25 ° C ( 68 ° F to 77 ° F ) for up to 12 hours ( including infusion time ) .

( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • See boxed warning .
( 5 . 1 ) • Infusion - Associated Reactions ( IARs ) : If severe IARs occur , discontinue XENPOZYME and initiate appropriate medical treatment .
( 5 . 2 ) • Elevated Transaminases : Assess ALT and AST within one month prior to initiation of XENPOZYME , within 72 hours prior to any infusion during dose escalation , or prior to the next scheduled XENPOZYME infusion upon resuming treatment following a missed dose .
( 5 . 3 ) • Risk of Fetal Malformations During Dosage Initiation or Escalation in Pregnancy : XENPOZYME dosage initiation or escalation , at any time during pregnancy , is not recommended as it may lead to elevated sphingomyelin metabolite levels that may increase the risk of fetal malformations .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 14 days after the last dose if XENPOZYME is discontinued .
( 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis Prior to XENPOZYME administration , consider pretreating with antihistamines , antipyretics , and / or corticosteroids .
Appropriate medical support measures , including cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment , should be readily available during XENPOZYME administration .
If a severe hypersensitivity reaction ( e . g . , anaphylaxis ) occurs , discontinue XENPOZYME immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment .
Consider the risks and benefits of re - administering XENPOZYME following severe hypersensitivity reactions ( including anaphylaxis ) .
One patient has been rechallenged using slower infusion rates at a dosage lower than the recommended dosage .
In patients with severe hypersensitivity reaction , a tailored desensitization procedure to XENPOZYME may be considered .
If the decision is made to readminister XENPOZYME , ensure the patient tolerates the infusion .
If the patient tolerates the infusion , the dosage ( dose and / or the rate ) may be increased to reach the approved recommended dosage .
If a mild or moderate hypersensitivity reaction occurs , the infusion rate may be slowed or temporarily withheld , and / or the XENPOZYME dose reduced [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , have been reported in olipudase alfa - treated patients .
One 18 - month - old XENPOZYME - treated patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction during the sixth infusion in the dose escalation period in Trial 2 [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Additionally , a 16 - month - old patient with ASMD type A , treated with a version of olipudase alfa manufactured from a different process , experienced two anaphylactic reactions during the fifth and sixth infusions in the dose escalation period ; the patient received an immune tolerance induction therapy prior to treatment .
In both of these pediatric patients who had anaphylaxis , anti - olipudase alfa - rpcp IgE ( IgE ADA ) and IgG ( IgG ADA ) antibodies were detected [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 6 ) ] .
Hypersensitivity related reactions that were mild to moderate in severity occurred in 10 ( 33 % ) XENPOZYME - treated adult patients and 4 ( 50 % ) XENPOZYME - treated pediatric patients in clinical trials .
Hypersensitivity reactions in adults included urticaria , pruritus , erythema , rash , rash erythematous , eczema , angioedema , and erythema nodosum .
Hypersensitivity reactions in pediatric patients included urticaria , pruritus , rash , erythema , and localized edema [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
• Consider testing for IgE ADA in XENPOZYME - treated patients who experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Testing for antibodies against olipudase alfa - rpcp are available through Genzyme Corporation ( at 1 - 800 - 745 - 4447 ) .
• Consider other clinical laboratory testing such as serum tryptase and complement activation in patients who experience anaphylaxis .
5 . 2 Infusion - Associated Reactions Antihistamines , antipyretics , and / or corticosteroids may be given prior to XENPOZYME administration to reduce the risk of infusion - associated reactions ( IARs ) .
However , IARs may still occur in patients after receiving pretreatment .
• If severe IARs occur , discontinue XENPOZYME immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment .
Consider the risks and benefits of re - administering XENPOZYME following severe IARs .
One patient has been rechallenged using slower infusion rates at a dose lower than the recommended dose .
Once a patient tolerates the infusion , the dose may be increased to reach the recommended dose .
• If a mild or moderate IAR occurs , the infusion rate may be slowed or temporarily withheld , and / or the XENPOZYME dosage may be reduced [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
IARs occurred in approximately 75 % of pediatric and 50 % of adult XENPOZYME - treated patients in the clinical trials ; a severe IAR occurred in one ( 12 . 5 % ) of the pediatric patients .
The most frequent IARs in : • ≥ 10 % of adult patients were headache , pruritus , vomiting , and urticaria • > 20 % of pediatric patients were urticaria , erythema , headache , nausea , pyrexia , and vomiting Acute phase reaction ( APR ) , an acute inflammatory response accompanied by elevations in inflammatory serum protein concentrations , was observed in one XENPOZYME - treated adult and one XENPOZYME - treated pediatric patient .
Most of the APRs occurred at 48 hours post infusion during the dose escalation period .
Elevations of C - reactive protein , calcitonin , and IL - 6 , and reduction of serum iron were observed .
The most common clinical symptoms associated with APRs were pyrexia , vomiting , and diarrhea .
All events can be managed as other IARs .
5 . 3 Elevated Transaminases Levels XENPOZYME may be associated with elevated transaminases ( ALT , AST , or both ) within 24 to 48 hours after infusion .
Elevated transaminase levels were reported in 4 ( 13 % ) XENPOZYME - treated adults and 1 ( 13 % ) XENPOZYME - treated pediatric patient during the dose escalation phase in clinical trials .
At the time of the next scheduled infusion , these elevated transaminase levels generally returned to levels observed prior to the XENPOZYME infusion [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
To manage the risk of elevated transaminase levels , assess ALT and AST within one month prior to initiation of XENPOZYME , within 72 hours prior to any infusion during dose escalation , which includes the first 3 mg / kg dose outlined in Tables 1 and 2 , or prior to the next scheduled XENPOZYME infusion upon resuming treatment following a missed dose .
If either the baseline or pre - infusion transaminase level ( during the dose escalation phase ) is > 2 times the ULN , repeat transaminase levels within 72 hours after the end of the infusion .
If the pre - infusion transaminase levels are elevated above baseline and > 2 times the ULN prior to the next scheduled administration , the XENPOZYME dose can be reduced ( repeat prior lower dose or reduce the dose ) or XENPOZYME can be temporarily withheld until the liver transaminases return to the patient ' s baseline value .
Upon reaching the recommended maintenance dose , transaminase testing is recommended to be continued as part of routine clinical management of ASMD .
5 . 4 Risk of Fetal Malformations During Dosage Initiation or Escalation in Pregnancy There is no evidence that olipudase alfa - rpcp crosses the human placenta .
However , published literature reports that early embryonic exposure to a metabolite of sphingomyelin ( ceramide ) or the S1P receptor modulator fingolimod can produce exencephaly in chicks and mice , respectively .
In animal reproduction studies , exencephaly , a neural tube defect occurring in the first trimester of pregnancy , was observed in mouse fetuses at exposures less than the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of olipudase alfa - rpcp .
XENPOZYME dosage initiation or escalation , at any time during pregnancy , is not recommended as it may lead to elevated sphingomyelin metabolite levels that may increase the risk of fetal malformations [ see Use in Specific Population ( 8 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
The decision to continue or discontinue XENPOZYME maintenance dosing in pregnancy should consider the female ' s need for XENPOZYME , the potential drug - related risks to the fetus , and the potential adverse outcomes from untreated maternal ASMD disease .
Verify the pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating XENPOZYME treatment .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 14 days after the last dose if XENPOZYME is discontinued .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The pooled safety analysis from 3 clinical trials included a total of 38 XENPOZYME - treated patients ( 30 adult and 8 pediatric patients ) with age range from 1 . 5 to 59 years old receiving intravenous doses up to 3 mg / kg every 2 weeks [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The median exposure duration was 2 . 5 years ( range : 0 . 4 to 3 . 7 years ) in adult patients and 2 . 7 years ( range : 2 . 5 to 3 . 2 years ) in pediatric patients .
Serious adverse reactions of anaphylactic reaction were reported in 2 ( 25 % ) XENPOZYME - treated pediatric patients .
Most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in adults ( incidence ≥ 10 % ) were headache , cough , diarrhea , hypotension , and ocular hyperemia .
Most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in pediatric patients ( incidence ≥ 20 % ) were pyrexia , cough , diarrhea , rhinitis , abdominal pain , vomiting , headache , urticaria , nausea , rash , arthralgia , pruritus , fatigue , and pharyngitis .
Adult patients with ASMD type B and type A / B ( Trial 1 ) In Trial 1 , 13 adult patients received XENPOZYME once every 2 weeks for 52 weeks ( primary analysis period ( PAP ) ) at dosages escalating from 0 . 1 mg / kg to a target dose of 3 mg / kg [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 7 % of XENPOZYME - treated adult patients during the PAP are described in Table 7 .

All patients continued into Trial 3 .
Treatment related serious adverse reactions , hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis , and IARs occurred within 24 hours of infusion and were observed in a higher percentage of pediatric patients than in adult patients .
Laboratory Adverse Reaction Elevated transaminase levels ranging from 3 times to 14 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) were reported in 4 ( 13 % ) adults and 1 ( 13 % ) pediatric patient during the XENPOZYME dose escalation phase in clinical trials .
Immunogenicity : Antidrug Antibody - Associated Adverse Reactions In Trial 1 , infusion - associated reactions ( including hypersensitivity reactions ) occurred in a higher percentage in XENPOZYME - treated patients who developed IgG ADA compared to those who did not develop IgG ADA ( 73 % versus 44 % ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 6 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
In Trial 2 , one XENPOZYME - treated pediatric patient ( 18 - months old ) experienced an anaphylactic reaction during the sixth infusion and developed IgE ADA and the highest IgG ADA titers ( ADA peak titer 1 , 600 ) of the patients in this trial .
After treatment discontinuation , XENPOZYME was resumed four months later using a diluted drug solution and a desensitization procedure .
One pediatric patient ( 16 - months old ) with ASMD type A , treated with a version of olipudase alfa manufactured from a different process , experienced anaphylactic reactions ( both during the fifth and sixth infusions ) and developed IgG ADA ( highest titer 1 , 600 ) and IgE ADA [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal reproduction studies , XENPOZYME may cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female .
XENPOZYME dosage initiation or escalation , at any time during pregnancy , is not recommended as it may lead to elevated sphingomyelin metabolite levels that may increase the risk of fetal malformations ( see Data ) , [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
However , the decision to continue or discontinue XENPOZYME maintenance dosing in pregnancy should consider the female ' s need for XENPOZYME , the potential drug - related risks to the fetus , and the potential adverse outcomes from untreated maternal ASMD disease .
In an embryo - fetal toxicity study in pregnant mice , a rare malformation ( exencephaly ) was observed in offspring at an exposure less than the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of olipudase alfa - rpcp ( see Data ) .
There are no available data on XENPOZYME use in pregnant females to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Advise the pregnant female of the potential risk to the fetus .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , miscarriage , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant mice , olipudase alfa - rpcp was administered intravenously at doses of 3 , 10 , or 30 mg / kg daily from gestation day ( GD ) 6 through GD 15 .
Exencephaly was observed in 1 litter at each of the 10 and 30 mg / kg dose groups ( 2 and 3 fetuses , respectively ) .
These data are consistent with published literature reports that brief embryonic exposures to sphingomyelin metabolites or a sphingosine - 1 - phosphate ( S1P ) receptor modulator produced neural tube defects , including exencephaly , in chicks and mice .
The developmental No Observed Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL ) is 3 mg / kg .
The AUC associated with this dose is 0 . 14 - fold the clinical exposure at the MRHD .
The developmental Lowest - Observed - Adverse - Effect Level ( LOAEL ) , 10 mg / kg , is also associated with an exposure that is less than the clinical exposure at the MRHD .
In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rabbits , olipudase alfa - rpcp was administered intravenously at doses of 3 , 10 , or 30 mg / kg daily from GD 6 through GD 19 .
There was no maternal or developmental toxicity .
The developmental NOAEL was 30 mg / kg ; the AUC0 – 24 at this dose is approximately 10 . 5 - fold the exposure at the MRHD .
In a study of pre - and postnatal development in mice , olipudase alfa - rpcp was administered intravenously every other day from GD 6 through GD 18 ; then resumed every other day after parturition , from Lactation Day ( LD ) 1 through LD 19 .
Olipudase alfa - rpcp did not induce any effect on maternal reproductive function or on developmental and reproductive parameters of male and female offspring .
Therefore , the maternal and developmental NOAELs are 30 mg / kg .
Exposures at this dose , based on the embryo - fetal development study , were estimated to be approximately 1 . 5 - fold the MRHD of olipudase alfa - rpcp .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of olipudase alfa - rpcp in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Olipudase alfa - rpcp is present in animal milk .
( see Data ) .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for XENPOZYME and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from XENPOZYME or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data Olipudase alfa - rpcp was administered as a single intravenous dose ( 3 mg / kg ) to lactating CD1 mice on post - partum day 7 .
Milk was not evaluated until post - partum day 9 , at which time concentrations of olipudase alfa - rpcp detected were approximately 1 . 3 % the estimated maximal maternal plasma concentration .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential XENPOZYME may cause embryo - fetal harm when administered during the first trimester of pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating XENPOZYME .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 14 days after the last dose if XENPOZYME is discontinued .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of XENPOZYME for the treatment of non - central nervous system manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency ( ASMD ) have been established in pediatric patients down to birth .
Use of XENPOZYME for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate , and well - controlled trial ( Trial 1 ) in adults with supportive efficacy , safety , and tolerability data in pediatric patients ( Trial 2 and Trial 3 ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 , 14 . 3 , 14 . 4 ) ] .
Compared to adults , a higher percentage of pediatric patients experienced treatment related serious adverse reactions , anaphylaxis , hypersensitivity reactions , and IARs that occurred within 24 hours of infusion [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Two pediatric patients , an 18 month old receiving XENPOZYME and a 16 month old with ASMD type A that received a version of olipudase alfa manufactured from a different process developed anaphylaxis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of XENPOZYME - treated adult patients in these trials , 1 ( 3 % ) was 65 to 74 years of age , and none were 75 years of age and older .
[ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Clinical trials of XENPOZYME did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients .
11 DESCRIPTION Olipudase alfa - rpcp is a hydrolytic lysosomal sphingomyelin - specific enzyme consisting of 570 amino acids produced in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line by recombinant DNA technology .
The molecular weight of olipudase alfa - rpcp is approximately 76 kDa .
XENPOZYME ( olipudase alfa - rpcp ) for injection is supplied as a sterile white to off - white lyophilized powder for reconstitution and dilution to be administered via intravenous infusion .
XENPOZYME is supplied in single - dose vials .
Each vial contains 20 mg olipudase alfa - rpcp , dibasic sodium phosphate ( 4 . 47 mg ) , methionine ( 74 . 6 mg ) , monobasic sodium phosphate ( 8 . 17 mg ) , and sucrose ( 250 mg ) .
The pH is 6 . 5 after reconstitution .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action ASMD is a lysosomal storage disease that results from reduced activity of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM ) , caused by pathogenic variants in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 gene .
ASM degrades sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphocholine .
The deficiency of ASM causes an intra - lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin ( as well as cholesterol and other cell membrane lipids ) in various tissues .
XENPOZYME provides an exogenous source of ASM .
XENPOZYME is not expected to cross the blood - brain barrier or modulate the CNS manifestations of ASMD .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Plasma Ceramide Levels Ceramide is elevated in plasma of adult and pediatric patients with ASMD .
Plasma ceramide levels showed a transient increase after each administration ( post infusion ) of XENPOZYME .
In the dose escalation phase , plasma ceramide levels were substantially increased compared to the baseline level .
Plasma ceramide levels gradually decreased following repeated administration of XENPOZYME and the pre - infusion levels were generally lower than the baseline level during the maintenance phase of treatment .
• In adult patients with ASMD in Trial 1 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] , the mean ( standard deviation , SD ) pre - infusion plasma ceramide concentration was 3 . 7 ( 1 . 4 ) mg / L at baseline and decreased to 2 . 2 ( 0 . 6 ) mg / L at Week 52 following treatment with XENPOZYME .
• In pediatric patients with ASMD in Trial 2 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] , the mean ( SD ) pre - infusion plasma ceramide concentration was 4 . 7 ( 0 . 9 ) mg / L at baseline and decreased to 1 . 8 ( 0 . 3 ) mg / L at Week 52 following treatment with XENPOZYME .
Plasma Lysosphingomyelin Levels Lysosphingomyelin is substantially elevated in plasma of adult and pediatric patients with ASMD .
Plasma lysosphingomyelin levels decreased after repeated administration of XENPOZYME .
• In adult patients with ASMD in Trial 1 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] , the mean ( SD ) pre - infusion plasma lysosphingomyelin concentration was 379 ( 204 ) mcg / L at baseline and decreased to 99 ( 118 ) mcg / L at Week 52 following treatment with XENPOZYME .
• In pediatric patients with ASMD in Trial 2 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] , the mean ( SD ) pre - infusion plasma lysosphingomyelin concentration was 625 ( 339 ) mcg / L at baseline and decreased to 80 ( 47 ) mcg / L at Week 52 following treatment with XENPOZYME .
Liver Sphingomyelin Content In adult patients , the liver sphingomyelin content , as assessed by histopathology , decreased from baseline to Week 52 in the XENPOZYME treatment group compared to an increase in the placebo group .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In adult patients with ASMD , the mean ( SD ) maximum plasma olipudase alfa - rpcp concentration ( Cmax ) and area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC ) at steady state were 30 ( 5 ) mcg / mL and 607 ( 120 ) mcg ∙ h / mL , respectively , at the recommended maintenance dose of 3 mg / kg administered once every 2 weeks .
Olipudase alfa - rpcp Cmax and AUC increase proportionally over a dose range of 0 . 1 to 3 mg / kg ( 0 . 03 to 1 times the approved recommended maintenance dose ) .
Distribution The mean ( SD ) volume of distribution of olipudase alfa - rpcp was 13 ( 2 ) L in adult patients with ASMD .
Elimination The mean ( SD ) clearance of olipudase alfa - rpcp was 0 . 33 ( 0 . 07 ) L / h and the mean half - life ( t1 / 2 ) ranged from 32 to 38 hours in adult patients with ASMD .
Metabolism The metabolic pathway of olipudase alfa - rpcp has not been characterized .
Olipudase alfa - rpcp is expected to be metabolized into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways .
Specific Populations Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients ( 1 . 5 to 17 . 5 years of age ) with ASMD , the mean ( SD ) Cmax was 24 . 3 ( 2 . 8 ) mcg / mL and the mean ( SD ) AUC was 449 ( 70 ) mcg ∙ h / mL at the recommended maintenance dose of 3 mg / kg administered once every 2 weeks .
12 . 6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti - drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti - drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti - drug antibodies in other studies , including those of olipudase alfa - rpcp or of other olipudase alfa products .
Following 0 . 4 to 3 . 7 years of XENPOZYME treatment in Trial 1 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] , 9 out of 30 ( 30 % ) XENPOZYME - treated adult patients with ASMD developed anti - olipudase alfa - rpcp IgG antibodies ( referred to as IgG ADA ) .
The median time to seroconversion from first XENPOZYME infusion was approximately 8 weeks .
One out of these 9 ( 11 % ) adult patients had neutralizing antibodies ( NAb ) that inhibited the olipudase alfa - rpcp enzyme activity .
None of these 9 patients had NAb that inhibit the cellular uptake of olipudase alfa - rpcp .
Following 2 . 5 to 3 . 2 years of XENPOZYME treatment in Trial 2 and 3 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] , 6 out of 8 ( 75 % ) XENPOZYME - treated pediatric patients with ASMD developed IgG ADA .
The median time to seroconversion from first XENPOZYME infusion was 10 weeks .
One out of the 6 ( 17 % ) pediatric patients developed NAb that inhibited olipudase alfa - rpcp enzyme activity .
None of these 6 patients had NAb that inhibited the cellular uptake of olipudase alfa - rpcp .
Infusion - associated reactions ( including hypersensitivity reactions ) occurred in a higher percentage in XENPOZYME - treated patients who developed ADA compared to those who did not develop ADA [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
There was no identified clinically significant effect of ADA on pharmacokinetics of XENPOZYME .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of olipudase alfa - rpcp have not been conducted .
Mutagenesis Studies to evaluate the mutagenic potential of olipudase alfa - rpcp have not been conducted .
Impairment of Fertility Intravenous administration of olipudase alfa - rpcp every other day at doses up to 30 mg / kg had no adverse effects in a combined study of fertility in male and female mice .
Exposures at this dose , based on the embryo - fetal development study , were estimated to be approximately 1 . 5 - fold those of the MRHD of olipudase alfa - rpcp .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In acid sphingomyelinase knockout ( ASMKO ) mice ( a disease model of ASMD ) , mortality was observed after a single dose ≥ 10 mg / kg administered as an IV bolus injection .
Observations ( lethargy , coolness to touch , and unwillingness to move ) , combined with the adrenal hemorrhage , suggested that hypotensive shock may be the cause of death .
These findings were accompanied by necrosis and apoptosis in the liver and adrenal gland , elevations of ceramide , sphingosine and sphingosine 1 - phosphate in the serum , catabolites of accumulated sphingomyelin as well as elevations in the serum concentrations of inflammatory mediators , such as cytokines and acute phase proteins .
In ASMKO mice , a dose - dependent reduction in heart rate accompanied by a decrease in motor activity and followed by a slow decline in blood pressure was noted after a single IV administration at 3 , 10 , and 20 mg / kg .
After 2 doses of olipudase alfa - rpcp at 3 and 10 mg / kg to ASMKO mice , a slight decline in heart rate was noted following the second administration .
Repeated dose studies in adult ASMKO mice show that administration of olipudase alfa - rpcp via a dose escalation regimen , ( 3 mg / kg administered IV every other day , followed by a single IV dose of 20 mg / kg 3 days later ) did not result in toxicity .
The lack of adverse findings in BALB / c , C57BL / 6 mice , rats , dogs , and monkeys at comparable olipudase alfa - rpcp doses suggested that the dose - related toxicity observed in ASMKO mice may be due to the rate and amount of substrate degradation .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Overview of Clinical Trials The efficacy of XENPOZYME for the treatment of non – central nervous system manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency ( ASMD ) has been evaluated in 3 clinical trials involving a total of 61 patients with ASMD : • Trial 1 in adult patients ( NCT02004691 ) , • Trial 2 in pediatric patients ( NCT02292654 ) , and • Trial 3 a long - term trial in pediatric patients ( NCT02004704 ) .
14 . 2 Clinical Trial in Adult Patients with ASMD Trial 1 was a multicenter , randomized , double - blinded , placebo - controlled , repeat - dose phase II / III trial in adult patients with ASMD ( clinical diagnosis consistent with ASMD type B and A / B ) .
In this trial , patients received either XENPOZYME or placebo .
Treatment was administered in both groups as an intravenous infusion once every 2 weeks .
XENPOZYME was dosed as follows : 0 . 1 mg / kg ( Day 1 , Week 0 ) , 0 . 3 mg / kg ( Weeks 2 and 4 ) , 0 . 6 mg / kg ( Weeks 6 and 8 ) , 1 mg / kg ( Week 10 ) , 2 mg / kg ( Week 12 ) , and then a maintenance dose of 3 mg / kg ( Week 14 onwards ) .
The trial was divided into 2 consecutive periods : a randomized placebo - controlled , double - blinded primary analysis period ( PAP ) which lasted to Week 52 , followed by an extension treatment period ( ETP ) for up to 4 years .
Patients randomized to the placebo arm in the PAP crossed over to receive XENPOZYME treatment in the ETP to reach the targeted dose of 3 mg / kg , while patients in the original XENPOZYME arm continued treatment .
Patients enrolled in the trial had a diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide ( DLco ) ≤ 70 % of the predicted normal value and a spleen volume ≥ 6 multiples of normal ( MN ) measured by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .
The trial population included 87 % White , 7 % Asian , and 7 % other ; for ethnicity , 32 % identified as Hispanic / Latino , 65 % as non - Hispanic / Latino , and 3 % were not reported .
Five males and 13 females with a median age of 34 years ( range : 18 to 66 ) were included in the placebo arm and 8 males and 5 females with a median age of 34 years ( range : 20 to 59 ) were included in the XENPOZYME arm .
The XENPOZYME and placebo groups included 1 patient ( 8 % ) and 2 patients ( 11 % ) with mild renal impairment ( 60 mL / minute ≤ creatinine clearance < 90 mL / minute ) , respectively .
There were no patients with moderate or severe renal impairment .
Key efficacy endpoints included assessment of % predicted DLco , spleen volume , liver volume , and platelet count .
At Week 52 during the PAP , an increase of 21 % in the mean percent change in % predicted DLco was observed in the XENPOZYME - treated patients compared to the placebo - treated patients ( Table 9 ) .
A reduction in spleen volume of 39 % was observed in the XENPOZYME - treated patients compared to the placebo - treated patients .
The changes in % predicted DLco and spleen volume were noted at Week 26 of treatment , the first post - dose endpoint assessment ( see Figures 1 and 2 ) .
A decrease in mean liver volume and an increase in mean platelet count were noted in the XENPOZYME - treated patients compared to the placebo - treated patients at Week 52 ( see Table 9 ) .

At Week 104 , patients initially randomized to placebo had received XENPOZYME for 52 weeks and demonstrated the following LS mean ( SE ) percent changes in clinical parameters from baseline ( before first administration of XENPOZYME ) : increase in % predicted DLco was 26 . 8 % ( 6 . 2 ) ( Figure 1 ) ; reduction in spleen volume ( MN ) was 36 . 5 % ( 2 . 5 ) ( Figure 2 ) ; reduction in liver volume ( MN ) was 29 . 5 ( 2 . 6 ) ; and increase in platelet count was 19 . 5 ( 6 . 7 ) .
Patients in the previous XENPOZYME group demonstrated improvement from baseline to Week 104 in the following parameters : LS mean ( SE ) percent increase in % predicted DLco was 34 . 1 % ( 7 . 9 ) ( Figure 1 ) ; LS mean ( SE ) percent reduction in spleen volume ( MN ) was 48 . 3 ( 2 . 9 ) ( Figure 2 ) ; LS mean ( SE ) percent reduction in liver volume ( MN ) was 31 . 7 ( 2 . 9 ) ; LS mean ( SE ) percent increase in platelet count was 24 . 0 ( 8 . 2 ) .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Clinical Trial in Pediatric Patients with ASMD Trial 2 was a multi - center , open - label , repeated - dose trial of XENPOZYME administered intravenously once every 2 weeks ( via infusion ) for 64 weeks in pediatric patients aged < 18 years with a clinical diagnosis consistent with ASMD type B and A / B .
Exploratory efficacy endpoints related to organomegaly , pulmonary and liver functions , and linear growth were evaluated at Week 52 .
XENPOZYME was dosed as follows : 0 . 03 mg / kg ( Day 1 , Week 0 ) , 0 . 1 mg / kg ( Weeks 2 ) , 0 . 3 mg / kg ( Weeks 4 and 6 ) , 0 . 6 mg / kg ( Week 8 and 10 ) , 1 mg / kg ( Week 12 ) , 2 mg / kg ( Week 14 ) , and then a maintenance dose of 3 mg / kg ( Week 16 onwards ) .
In Trial 2 , 8 patients ( 7 patients from 2 to < 12 years old , and 1 patient < 2 years old ) received an initial dose of 0 . 03 mg / kg XENPOZYME and all but one completed the dose escalation up to the maintenance dose of 3 mg / kg within 22 weeks .
All patients were White and of non - Hispanic / Latino ethnicity .
Patients enrolled in the trial had a spleen volume ≥ 5 MN measured by MRI .
Age of patients treated with XENPOZYME ranged from 1 to 10 years old , with both sexes equally represented .
Treatment with XENPOZYME resulted in improvements in mean percent change in % predicted DLco , spleen and liver volumes , platelet counts , and linear growth progression ( as measured by height Z - scores ) at Week 52 as compared to baseline ( see Table 10 ) .

Efficacy analyses showed continued improvements in the 3 patients evaluated for % predicted DLco , 6 patients evaluated for platelet counts , and all 8 patients evaluated for spleen and liver volumes , compared to baseline , during the additional 6 months extension .
In addition , the height Z - score increased by 1 . 3 from baseline when evaluated through 24 months of XENPOZYME treatment .
Bone age , as assessed by hand x - ray , was delayed by a mean of 26 . 4 months at baseline in the 7 pediatric patients enrolled in Trial 2 with a bone age measured at Month 24 in Trial 3 .
The bone age improved to within a mean of 12 months of the chronological age when assessed at Month 24 in these 7 patients .
