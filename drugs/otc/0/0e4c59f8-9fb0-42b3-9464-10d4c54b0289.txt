To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs , azithromycin tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria .
DESCRIPTION Azithromycin tablets contain the active ingredient azithromycin , an azalide , a subclass of macrolide antibiotics , for oral administration .
Azithromycin has the chemical name ( 2 R , 3 S , 4 R , 5 R , 8 R , 10 R , 11 R , 12 S , 13 S , 14 R ) - 13 - [ ( 2 , 6 - dideoxy - 3 - C - methyl - 3 - O - methyl - α - L - ribo - hexopyranosyl ) oxy ] - 2 - ethyl - 3 , 4 , 10 - trihydroxy - 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 - heptamethyl - 11 - [ [ 3 , 4 , 6 - trideoxy - 3 - ( dimethylamino ) - ß - D - xylo - hexopyranosyl ] oxy ] - 1 - oxa - 6 - azacyclopentadecan - 15 - one .
Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin ; however , it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl - substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring .
Its molecular formula is C38H72N2O12 , and its molecular weight is 749 .
Azithromycin has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Anhydrous azithromycin is a white amorphous powder with a molecular formula of C38H72N2O12 and a molecular weight of 749 .
Azithromycin tablet is supplied for oral administration as white , film - coated , oval shaped biconvex tablets containing anhydrous azithromycin 250 mg or 500 mg and the following inactive ingredients : microcrystalline cellulose , corn starch , croscarmellose sodium , magnesium trisilicate , magnesium stearate , colloidal silicon dioxide , hydroxypropyl cellulose , sodium lauryl sulfate , hypromellose , titanium dioxide and polyethylene glycol .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of a single 500 mg dose ( two 250 mg tablets ) to 36 fasted healthy male volunteers , the mean ( SD ) pharmacokinetic parameters were AUC0 - 72 = 4 . 3 ( 1 . 2 ) mcg • h / mL ; Cmax = 0 . 5 ( 0 . 2 ) mcg / mL ; Tmax = 2 . 2 ( 0 . 9 ) hours .
With a regimen of 500 mg ( two 250 mg capsules * ) on day 1 , followed by 250 mg daily ( one 250 mg capsule ) on days 2 through 5 , the pharmacokinetic parameters of azithromycin in plasma in healthy young adults ( 18 - 40 years of age ) are portrayed in the chart below .
Cmin and Cmax remained essentially unchanged from day 2 through day 5 of therapy .
Pharmacokinetic Parameters ( Mean ) Total n = 12 Day 1 Day 5 Cmax ( mcg / mL ) 0 . 41 0 . 24 Tmax ( h ) 2 . 5 3 . 2 AUC0 - 24 ( mcg • h / mL ) 2 . 6 2 . 1 Cmin ( mcg / mL ) 0 . 05 0 . 05 Urinary Excret .
( % dose ) 4 . 5 6 . 5 * Azithromycin 250 mg tablets are bioequivalent to 250 mg capsules in the fasted state .
Azithromycin 250 mg capsules are no longer commercially available .
In a two - way crossover study , 12 adult healthy volunteers ( 6 males , 6 females ) received 1 , 500 mg of azithromycin administered in single daily doses over either 5 days ( two 250 mg tablets on day 1 , followed by one 250 mg tablet on days 2 - 5 ) or 3 days ( 500 mg per day for days 1 - 3 ) .
Due to limited serum samples on day 2 ( 3 - day regimen ) and days 2 - 4 ( 5 - day regimen ) , the serum concentration - time profile of each subject was fit to a 3 - compartment model and the AUC0 –∞ - for the fitted concentration profile was comparable between the 5 - day and 3 - day regimens .
3 - Day Regimen 5 - Day Regimen Pharmacokinetic Parameter [ mean ( SD ) ] Day 1 Day 3 Day 1 Day 5 Cmax ( serum , mcg / mL ) 0 . 44 ( 0 . 22 ) 0 . 54 ( 0 . 25 ) 0 . 43 ( 0 . 20 ) 0 . 24 ( 0 . 06 ) SerumAUC0 –∞ ( mcg • hr / mL ) 17 . 4 ( 6 . 2 ) * 14 . 9 ( 3 . 1 ) * Serum T1 / 2 71 . 8 hr 68 . 9 hr * Total AUC for the entire 3 - day and 5 - day regimens Median azithromycin exposure ( AUC0 - 288 ) in mononuclear ( MN ) and polymorphonuclear ( PMN ) leukocytes following either the 5 - day or 3 - day regimen was more than a 1000 - fold and 800 - fold greater than in serum , respectively .
Administration of the same total dose with either the 5 - day or 3 - day regimen may be expected to provide comparable concentrations of azithromycin within MN and PMN leukocytes .
Two azithromycin 250 mg tablets are bioequivalent to a single 500 mg tablet .
Absorption The absolute bioavailability of azithromycin 250 mg capsules is 38 % .
In a two - way crossover study in which 12 healthy subjects received a single 500 mg dose of azithromycin ( two 250 mg tablets ) with or without a high fat meal , food was shown to increase Cmax by 23 % but had no effect on AUC .
When azithromycin suspension was administered with food to 28 adult healthy male subjects , Cmax increased by 56 % and AUC was unchanged .
The AUC of azithromycin was unaffected by co - administration of an antacid containing aluminum and magnesium hydroxide with azithromycin capsules ; however , the Cmax was reduced by 24 % .
Administration of cimetidine ( 800 mg ) two hours prior to azithromycin had no effect on azithromycin absorption .
Distribution The serum protein binding of azithromycin is variable in the concentration range approximating human exposure , decreasing from 51 % at 0 . 02 mcg / mL to 7 % at 2 mcg / mL .
Following oral administration , azithromycin is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent steady - state volume of distribution of 31 . 1 L / kg .
Greater azithromycin concentrations in tissues than in plasma or serum were observed .
High tissue concentrations should not be interpreted to be quantitatively related to clinical efficacy .
The antimicrobial activity of azithromycin is pH related and appears to be reduced with decreasing pH . However , the extensive distribution of drug to tissues may be relevant to clinical activity .
Selected tissue ( or fluid ) concentration and tissue ( or fluid ) to plasma / serum concentration ratios are shown in the following table : AZITHROMYCIN CONCENTRATIONS FOLLOWING A 500 mg DOSE ( TWO 250 mg CAPSULES ) IN ADULTS1 TISSUE OR FLUID TIME AFTER DOSE ( h ) TISSUE OR FLUID CONCENTRATION ( mcg / g or mcg / mL ) CORRESPONDING PLASMA OR SERUM LEVEL ( mcg / mL ) TISSUE ( FLUID ) PLASMA ( SERUM ) RATIO SKIN 72 - 96 0 . 4 0 . 012 35 LUNG 72 - 96 4 0 . 012 > 100 SPUTUM * 2 - 4 1 0 . 64 2 SPUTUM ** 10 - 12 2 . 9 0 . 1 30 TONSIL *** 9 - 18 4 . 5 0 . 03 > 100 TONSIL *** 180 0 . 9 0 . 006 > 100 CERVIX **** 19 2 . 8 0 . 04 70 1 Azithromycin tissue concentrations were originally determined using 250 mg capsules .
* Sample was obtained 2 - 4 hours after the first dose .
** Sample was obtained 10 - 12 hours after the first dose .
*** Dosing regimen of two doses of 250 mg each , separated by 12 hours .
**** Sample was obtained 19 hours after a single 500 mg dose .
The extensive tissue distribution was confirmed by examination of additional tissues and fluids ( bone , ejaculum , prostate , ovary , uterus , salpinx , stomach , liver , and gallbladder ) .
As there are no data from adequate and well - controlled studies of azithromycin treatment of infections in these additional body sites , the clinical importance of these tissue concentration data is unknown .
Following a regimen of 500 mg on the first day and 250 mg daily for 4 days , only very low concentrations were noted in cerebrospinal fluid ( less than 0 . 01 mcg / mL ) in the presence of non - inflamed meninges .
Metabolism In vitro and in vivo studies to assess the metabolism of azithromycin have not been performed .
Elimination Plasma concentrations of azithromycin following single 500 mg oral and i . v . doses declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL / min and terminal elimination half - life of 68 hours .
The prolonged terminal half - life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues .
Biliary excretion of azithromycin , predominantly as unchanged drug , is a major route of elimination .
Over the course of a week , approximately 6 % of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine .
Special Populations Renal Insufficiency Azithromycin pharmacokinetics were investigated in 42 adults ( 21 to 85 years of age ) with varying degrees of renal impairment .
Following the oral administration of a single 1 , 000 mg dose of azithromycin , mean Cmax and AUC0 - 120 increased by 5 . 1 % and 4 . 2 % , respectively in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment ( GFR 10 to 80 mL / min ) compared to subjects with normal renal function ( GFR > 80 mL / min ) .
The mean Cmax and AUC0 - 120 increased 61 % and 35 % , respectively in subjects with severe renal impairment ( GFR < 10 mL / min ) compared to subjects with normal renal function ( GFR > 80 mL / min ) .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of azithromycin in subjects with hepatic impairment have not been established .
Gender There are no significant differences in the disposition of azithromycin between male and female subjects .
No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender .
Geriatric Patients When studied in healthy elderly subjects aged 65 to 85 years , the pharmacokinetic parameters of azithromycin in elderly men were similar to those in young adults ; however , in elderly women , although higher peak concentrations ( increased by 30 to 50 % ) were observed , no significant accumulation occurred .
Pediatric Patients In two clinical studies , azithromycin for oral suspension was dosed at 10 mg / kg on day 1 , followed by 5 mg / kg on days 2 through 5 to two groups of pediatric patients ( aged 1 - 5 years and 5 - 15 years , respectively ) .
The mean pharmacokinetic parameters on day 5 were Cmax = 0 . 216 mcg / mL , Tmax = 1 . 9 hours , and AUC0 - 24 = 1 . 822 mcg • hr / mL for the 1 - to 5 - year - old group and were Cmax = 0 . 383 mcg / mL , Tmax = 2 . 4 hours , and AUC0 - 24 = 3 . 109 mcg • hr / mL for the 5 - to 15 - year - old group .
Two clinical studies were conducted in 68 pediatric patients aged 3 - 16 years to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of azithromycin for oral suspension .
Azithromycin was administered following a low - fat breakfast .
The first study consisted of 35 pediatric patients treated with 20 mg / kg / day ( maximum daily dose 500 mg ) for 3 days of whom 34 patients were evaluated for pharmacokinetics .
In the second study , 33 pediatric patients received doses of 12 mg / kg / day ( maximum daily dose 500 mg ) for 5 days of whom 31 patients were evaluated for pharmacokinetics .
In both studies , azithromycin concentrations were determined over a 24 hour period following the last daily dose .
Patients weighing above 25 kg in the 3 - day study or 41 . 7 kg in the 5 - day study received the maximum adult daily dose of 500 mg .
Eleven patients ( weighing 25 . 0 kg or less ) in the first study and 17 patients ( weighing 41 . 7 kg or less ) in the second study received a total dose of 60 mg / kg .
The following table shows pharmacokinetic data in the subset of pediatric patients who received a total dose of 60 mg / kg .
Pharmacokinetic Parameter [ mean ( SD ) ] 3 - Day Regimen ( 20 mg / kg x 3 days ) 5 - Day Regimen ( 12 mg / kg x 5 days ) n 11 17 Cmax ( mcg / mL ) 1 . 1 ( 0 . 4 ) 0 . 5 ( 0 . 4 ) Tmax ( hr ) 2 . 7 ( 1 . 9 ) 2 . 2 ( 0 . 8 ) Auc0 - 24 mcg • hr / mL 7 . 9 ( 2 . 9 ) 3 . 9 ( 1 . 9 ) The similarity of the overall exposure ( AUC0 –∞ ) between the 3 - day and 5 - day regimens in pediatric patients is unknown .
Single dose pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients given doses of 30 mg / kg have not been studied .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
Drug - Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies were performed with azithromycin and other drugs likely to be co - administered .
The effects of co - administration of azithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs are shown in Table 1 and the effect of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin are shown in Table 2 .
Co - administration of azithromycin at therapeutic doses had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of the drugs listed in Table 1 .
No dosage adjustment of drugs listed in Table 1 is recommended when co - administered with azithromycin .
Co - administration of azithromycin with efavirenz or fluconazole had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin .
Nelfinavir significantly increased the Cmax and AUC of azithromycin .
No dosage adjustment of azithromycin is recommended when administered with drugs listed in Table 2 .

Microbiology : Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50 S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and , thus , interfering with microbial protein synthesis .
Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected .
Azithromycin concentrates in phagocytes and fibroblasts as demonstrated by in vitro incubation techniques .
Using such methodology , the ratio of intracellular to extracellular concentration was > 30 after one hour incubation .
In vivo studies suggest that concentration in phagocytes may contribute to drug distribution to inflamed tissues .
Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section .
Aerobic and facultative gram - positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes NOTE : Azithromycin demonstrates cross - resistance with erythromycin - resistant gram - positive strains .
Most strains of Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin - resistant staphylococci are resistant to azithromycin .
Aerobic and facultative gram - negative microorganisms Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae “ Other ” microorganisms Chlamydia pneumoniae Chlamydia trachomatis Mycoplasma pneumoniae Beta - lactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity .
The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
At least 90 % of the following microorganisms exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoints for azithromycin .
However , the safety and effectiveness of azithromycin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well - controlled trials .
Aerobic and facultative gram - positive microorganisms Streptococci ( Groups C , F , G ) Viridans group streptococci Aerobic and facultative gram - negative microorganisms Bordetella pertussis Legionella pneumophila Anaerobic microorganisms Peptostreptococcus species Prevotella bivia “ Other ” microorganisms Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing Methods : When available , the results of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in resident hospitals should be provided to the physician as periodic reports which describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community - acquired pathogens .
These reports may differ from susceptibility data obtained from outpatient use , but could aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial .
Dilution techniques : Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) .
These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure .
Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1 , 3 ( broth or agar ) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of azithromycin powder .
The MIC values should be interpreted according to criteria provided in Table 1 .
Diffusion techniques : Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
One such standardized procedure2 , 3 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations .
This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 15 - mcg azithromycin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to azithromycin .
The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 1 .
Table 1 .
Susceptibility Interpretive Criteria for Azithromycin Susceptibility Test Result Interpretive Criteria Minimum Inhibitory Disk Diffusion Pathogen Concentrations ( mcg / mL ) ( zone diameters in mm ) S I Ra S I Ra Haemophilus spp ≤ 4 -- -- ≥ 12 -- -- Staphylococcus aureus ≤ 2 4 ≥ 8 ≥ 18 14 - 17 ≤ 13 Streptococci including S . pneumoniaeb ≤ 0 . 5 1 ≥ 2 ≥ 18 14 - 17 ≤ 13 a The current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any category other than “ susceptible . ”
If strains yield MIC results other than susceptible , they should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing .
b Susceptibility of streptococci including S . pneumoniae to azithromycin and other macrolides can be predicted by testing erythromycin .
No interpretive criteria have been established for testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae .
This species is not usually tested .
A report of “ susceptible ” indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations usually achievable .
A report of “ intermediate ” indicates that the result should be considered equivocal , and , if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative , clinically feasible drugs , the test should be repeated .
This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used .
This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation .
A report of “ resistant ” indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations usually achievable ; other therapy should be selected .
QUALITY CONTROL : Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of quality control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the test procedures .
Standard azithromycin powder should provide the following range of values noted in Table 2 .
Quality control microorganisms are specific strains of organisms with intrinsic biological properties .
QC strains are very stable strains which will give a standard and repeatable susceptibility pattern .
The specific strains used for microbiological quality control are not clinically significant .

As recommended dosages , durations of therapy and applicable patient populations vary among these infections , please see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for specific dosing recommendations . Adults : Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis or Streptococcus pneumoniae .
Acute bacterial sinusitis due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis or Streptococcus pneumoniae .
Community - acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy .
NOTE : Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors such as any of the following : patients with cystic fibrosis , patients with nosocomially acquired infections , patients with known or suspected bacteremia , patients requiring hospitalization , elderly or debilitated patients , or patients with significant underlying health problems that may compromise their ability to respond to their illness ( including immunodeficiency or functional asplenia ) .
Pharyngitis / tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first - line therapy in individuals who cannot use first - line therapy .
NOTE : Penicillin by the intramuscular route is the usual drug of choice in the treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infection and the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever .
Azithromycin tablet is often effective in the eradication of susceptible strains of Streptococcus pyogenes from the nasopharynx .
Because some strains are resistant to azithromycin tablet , susceptibility tests should be performed when patients are treated with azithromycin tablet .
Data establishing efficacy of azithromycin in subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available .
Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections due to Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pyogenes , or Streptococcus agalactiae .
Abscesses usually require surgical drainage .
Urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae .
Genital ulcer disease in men due to Haemophilus ducreyi ( chancroid ) .
Due to the small number of women included in clinical trials , the efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of chancroid in women has not been established .
Azithromycin tablet , at the recommended dose , should not be relied upon to treat syphilis .
Antimicrobial agents used in high doses for short periods of time to treat non - gonococcal urethritis may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis .
All patients with sexually - transmitted urethritis or cervicitis should have a serologic test for syphilis and appropriate cultures for gonorrhea performed at the time of diagnosis .
Appropriate antimicrobial therapy and follow - up tests for these diseases should be initiated if infection is confirmed .
Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment to determine the causative organism and its susceptibility to azithromycin .
Therapy with azithromycin tablet may be initiated before results of these tests are known ; once the results become available , antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted accordingly .
To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin tablet and other antibacterial drugs , azithromycin tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
Pediatric Patients : ( See PRECAUTIONS — Pediatric Use and CLINICAL STUDIES IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS ) .
Acute otitis media caused by Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis or Streptococcus pneumoniae .
( For specific dosage recommendation , see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Community - acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy .
( For specific dosage recommendation , see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
NOTE : Azithromycin should not be used in pediatric patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors such as any of the following : patients with cystic fibrosis , patients with nosocomially acquired infections , patients with known or suspected bacteremia , patients requiring hospitalization , or patients with significant underlying health problems that may compromise their ability to respond to their illness ( including immunodeficiency or functional asplenia ) .
Pharyngitis / tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first - line therapy in individuals who cannot use first - line therapy .
( For specific dosage recommendation , see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
NOTE : Penicillin by the intramuscular route is the usual drug of choice in the treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infection and the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever .
Azithromycin tablet is often effective in the eradication of susceptible strains of Streptococcus pyogenes from the nasopharynx .
Because some strains are resistant to azithromycin tablet , susceptibility tests should be performed when patients are treated with azithromycin tablet .
Data establishing efficacy of azithromycin in subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available .
Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment to determine the causative organism and its susceptibility to azithromycin .
Therapy with azithromycin tablet may be initiated before results of these tests are known ; once the results become available , antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted accordingly .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Azithromycin tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to azithromycin , erythromycin , any macrolide or ketolide antibiotic .
WARNINGS Serious allergic reactions , including angioedema , anaphylaxis , and dermatologic reactions including Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported rarely in patients on azithromycin therapy .
Although rare , fatalities have been reported .
( See CONTRAINDICATIONS . )
Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms , when symptomatic therapy was discontinued , the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure .
These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment .
The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half - life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is unknown at present .
If an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted .
Physicians should be aware that reappearance of the allergic symptoms may occur when symptomatic therapy is discontinued .
In the treatment of pneumonia , azithromycin has only been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of community - acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy .
Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors such as any of the following : patients with cystic fibrosis , patients with nosocomially acquired infections , patients with known or suspected bacteremia , patients requiring hospitalization , elderly or debilitated patients , or patients with significant underlying health problems that may compromise their ability to respond to their illness ( including immunodeficiency or functional asplenia ) .
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including azithromycin , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
PRECAUTIONS General : Because azithromycin is principally eliminated via the liver , caution should be exercised when azithromycin is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function .
Due to the limited data in subjects with GFR < 10 mL / min , caution should be exercised when prescribing azithromycin in these patients .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Special Populations - Renal Insufficiency . )
Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval , imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes , have been seen in treatment with other macrolides .
A similar effect with azithromycin cannot be completely ruled out in patients at increased risk for prolonged cardiac repolarization .
Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of myasthenic syndrome have been reported in patients receiving azithromycin therapy .
Prescribing azithromycin tablet in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria . Information for Patients : Azithromycin tablets and oral suspension can be taken with or without food .
Patients should also be cautioned not to take aluminum - and magnesium - containing antacids and azithromycin simultaneously .
The patient should be directed to discontinue azithromycin immediately and contact a physician if any signs of an allergic reaction occur .
Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including azithromycin tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When azithromycin tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by azithromycin tablet or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued .
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics , patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic .
If this occurs , patients should contact their physician as soon as possible .
Drug Interactions : Co - administration of nelfinavir at steady - state with a single oral dose of azithromycin resulted in increased azithromycin serum concentrations .
Although a dose adjustment of azithromycin is not recommended when administered in combination with nelfinavir , close monitoring for known side effects of azithromycin , such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment , is warranted .
( See ADVERSE REACTIONS . )
Although , in a study of 22 healthy men , a 5 - day course of azithromycin did not affect the prothrombin time from a subsequently administered dose of warfarin , spontaneous post - marketing reports suggest that concomitant administration of azithromycin may potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants .
Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving azithromycin and oral anticoagulants concomitantly .
Drug interaction studies were performed with azithromycin and other drugs likely to be coadministered .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Drug - Drug Interactions . )
When used in therapeutic doses , azithromycin had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin , carbamazepine , cetirizine , didanosine , efavirenz , fluconazole , indinavir , midazolam , rifabutin , sildenafil , theophylline ( intravenous and oral ) , triazolam , trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine .
Co - administration with efavirenz , or fluconazole had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin .
No dosage adjustment of either drug is recommended when azithromycin is coadministered with any of the above agents .
Interactions with the drugs listed below have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin ; however , no specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug - drug interaction .
Nonetheless , they have been observed with macrolide products .
Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when azithromycin and these drugs are used concomitantly , careful monitoring of patients is advised : Digoxin – elevated digoxin concentrations .
Ergotamine or dihydroergotamine – acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia .
Terfenadine , cyclosporine , hexobarbital and phenytoin concentrations .
Laboratory Test Interactions : There are no reported laboratory test interactions .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Long - term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential .
azithromycin has shown no mutagenic potential in standard laboratory tests : mouse lymphoma assay , human lymphocyte clastogenic assay , and mouse bone marrow clastogenic assay .
No evidence of impaired fertility due to azithromycin was found .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects .
Pregnancy Category B : Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice at doses up to moderately maternally toxic dose concentrations ( i . e . , 200 mg / kg / day ) .
These doses , based on a mg / m2 basis , are estimated to be 4 and 2 times , respectively , the human daily dose of 500 mg .
In the animal studies , no evidence of harm to the fetus due to azithromycin was found .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : It is not known whether azithromycin is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when azithromycin is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use : ( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , INDICATIONS AND USAGE , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Acute Otitis Media ( total dosage regimen : 30 mg / kg , see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) : Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with otitis media under 6 months of age have not been established .
Acute Bacterial Sinusitis ( dosage regimen : 10 mg / kg on Days 1 - 3 ) : Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with acute bacterial sinusitis under 6 months of age have not been established .
Use of azithromycin tablet for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in pediatric patients ( 6 months of age or greater ) is supported by adequate and well - controlled studies in adults , similar pathophysiology of acute sinusitis in adults and pediatric patients , and studies of acute otitis media in pediatric patients .
Community - Acquired Pneumonia ( dosage regimen : 10 mg / kg on Day 1 followed by 5 mg / kg on Days 2 - 5 ) : Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with community - acquired pneumonia under 6 months of age have not been established .
Safety and effectiveness for pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were documented in pediatric clinical trials .
Safety and effectiveness for pneumonia due to Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were not documented bacteriologically in the pediatric clinical trial due to difficulty in obtaining specimens .
Use of azithromycin for these two microorganisms is supported , however , by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies in adults .
Pharyngitis / Tonsillitis ( dosage regimen : 12 mg / kg on Days 1 - 5 ) : Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with pharyngitis / tonsillitis under 2 years of age have not been established .
Studies evaluating the use of repeated courses of therapy have not been conducted .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY . )
Geriatric Use : Pharmacokinetic parameters in older volunteers ( 65 - 85 years old ) were similar to those in younger volunteers ( 18 - 40 years old ) for the 5 - day therapeutic regimen .
Dosage adjustment does not appear to be necessary for older patients with normal renal and hepatic function receiving treatment with this dosage regimen .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY . )
In multiple - dose clinical trials of oral azithromycin , 9 % of patients were at least 65 years of age ( 458 / 4949 ) and 3 % of patients ( 144 / 4949 ) were at least 75 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
Azithromycin tablets 250 mg contain 1 . 21 mg of sodium per tablet .
Azithromycin tablets 500 mg contain 2 . 42 mg of sodium per tablet .
ADVERSE REACTIONS In clinical trials , most of the reported side effects were mild to moderate in severity and were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug .
Potentially serious side effects of angioedema and cholestatic jaundice were reported rarely .
Approximately 0 . 7 % of the patients ( adults and pediatric patients ) from the 5 - day multiple - dose clinical trials discontinued azithromycin tablet therapy because of treatment - related side effects .
In adults given 500 mg / day for 3 days , the discontinuation rate due to treatment - related side effects was 0 . 6 % .
In clinical trials in pediatric patients given 30 mg / kg , either as a single dose or over 3 days , discontinuation from the trials due to treatment - related side effects was approximately 1 % .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
Most of the side effects leading to discontinuation were related to the gastrointestinal tract , e . g . , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or abdominal pain .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS . )
Clinical : Adults : Multiple - dose regimens : Overall , the most common treatment - related side effects in adult patients receiving multiple - dose regimens of azithromycin tablet were related to the gastrointestinal system with diarrhea / loose stools ( 4 - 5 % ) , nausea ( 3 % ) and abdominal pain ( 2 - 3 % ) being the most frequently reported .

The majority of subjects with elevated serum creatinine also had abnormal values at baseline .
When follow - up was provided , changes in laboratory tests appeared to be reversible .
In multiple - dose clinical trials involving more than 5000 patients , four patients discontinued therapy because of treatment - related liver enzyme abnormalities and one because of a renal function abnormality .
Pediatric Patients : One , Three and Five Day Regimens Laboratory data collected from comparative clinical trials employing two 3 - day regimens ( 30 mg / kg or 60 mg / kg in divided doses over 3 days ) , or two 5 - day regimens ( 30 mg / kg or 60 mg / kg in divided doses over 5 days ) were similar for regimens of azithromycin and all comparators combined , with most clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring at incidences of 1 - 5 % .
Laboratory data for patients receiving 30 mg / kg as a single dose were collected in one single center trial .
In that trial , an absolute neutrophil count between 500 - 1500 cells / mm3 was observed in 10 / 64 patients receiving 30 mg / kg as a single dose , 9 / 62 patients receiving 30 mg / kg given over 3 days , and 8 / 63 comparator patients .
No patient had an absolute neutrophil count < 500 cells / mm3 .

CLINICAL STUDIES ( See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and Pediatric Use . )
Pediatric Patients From the perspective of evaluating pediatric clinical trials , Days 11 - 14 were considered on - therapy evaluations because of the extended half - life of azithromycin .
Day 11 - 14 data are provided for clinical guidance .
Day 24 - 32 evaluations were considered the primary test of cure endpoint .
Acute Otitis Media Safety and efficacy using azithromycin 30 mg / kg given over 5 days Protocol 1 In a double - blind , controlled clinical study of acute otitis media performed in the United States , azithromycin ( 10 mg / kg on Day 1 followed by 5 mg / kg on Days 2 - 5 ) was compared to amoxicillin / clavulanate potassium ( 4 : 1 ) .
For the 553 patients who were evaluated for clinical efficacy , the clinical success rate ( i . e . , cure plus improvement ) at the Day 11 visit was 88 % for azithromycin and 88 % for the control agent .
For the 521 patients who were evaluated at the Day 30 visit , the clinical success rate was 73 % for azithromycin and 71 % for the control agent .
In the safety analysis of the above study , the incidence of treatment - related adverse events , primarily gastrointestinal , in all patients treated was 9 % with azithromycin and 31 % with the control agent .
The most common side effects were diarrhea / loose stools ( 4 % azithromycin vs . 20 % control ) , vomiting ( 2 % azithromycin vs . 7 % control ) , and abdominal pain ( 2 % azithromycin vs . 5 % control ) .
Protocol 2 In a non - comparative clinical and microbiologic trial performed in the United States , where significant rates of beta - lactamase producing organisms ( 35 % ) were found , 131 patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy .
The combined clinical success rate ( i . e . , cure and improvement ) at the Day 11 visit was 84 % for azithromycin .
For the 122 patients who were evaluated at the Day 30 visit , the clinical success rate was 70 % for azithromycin .
Microbiologic determinations were made at the pre - treatment visit .
Microbiology was not reassessed at later visits .
The following presumptive bacterial / clinical cure outcomes ( i . e . , clinical success ) were obtained from the evaluable group Presumed Bacteriologic Eradication Day 11 Azithromycin Day 30 Azithromycin S . pneumoniae 61 / 74 ( 82 % ) 40 / 56 ( 71 % ) H . influenzae 43 / 54 ( 80 % ) 30 / 47 ( 64 % ) M . catarrhalis 28 / 35 ( 80 % ) 19 / 26 ( 73 % ) S . pyogenes 11 / 11 ( 100 % ) 7 / 7 Overall 177 / 217 ( 82 % ) 97 / 137 ( 73 % ) In the safety analysis of this study , the incidence of treatment - related adverse events , primarily gastrointestinal , in all patients treated was 9 % .
The most common side effect was diarrhea ( 4 % ) .
Protocol 3 In another controlled comparative clinical and microbiologic study of otitis media performed in the United States , azithromycin was compared to amoxicillin / clavulanate potassium ( 4 : 1 ) .
This study utilized two of the same investigators as Protocol 2 ( above ) , and these two investigators enrolled 90 % of the patients in Protocol 3 .
For this reason , Protocol 3 was not considered to be an independent study .
Significant rates of beta - lactamase producing organisms ( 20 % ) were found .
Ninety - two ( 92 ) patients were evaluable for clinical and microbiologic efficacy .
The combined clinical success rate ( i . e . , cure and improvement ) of those patients with a baseline pathogen at the Day 11 visit was 88 % for azithromycin vs . 100 % for control ; at the Day 30 visit , the clinical success rate was 82 % for azithromycin vs . 80 % for control .

ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY Phospholipidosis ( intracellular phospholipid accumulation ) has been observed in some tissues of mice , rats , and dogs given multiple doses of azithromycin .
It has been demonstrated in numerous organ systems ( e . g . , eye , dorsal root ganglia , liver , gallbladder , kidney , spleen , and pancreas ) in dogs treated with azithromycin at doses which , expressed on the basis of mg / m2 , are approximately equal to the recommended adult human dose , and in rats treated at doses approximately one - sixth of the recommended adult human dose .
This effect has been shown to be reversible after cessation of azithromycin treatment .
Phospholipidosis has been observed to a similar extent in the tissues of neonatal rats and dogs given daily doses of azithromycin ranging from 10 days to 30 days .
Based on the pharmacokinetic data , phospholipidosis has been seen in the rat ( 30 mg / kg dose ) at observed Cmaxvalue of 1 . 3 mcg / mL ( six times greater than the observed Cmax of 0 . 216 mcg / mL at the pediatric dose of 10 mg / kg ) .
Similarly , it has been shown in the dog ( 10 mg / kg dose ) at observed Cmax value of 1 . 5 mcg / mL ( seven times greater than the observed same Cmax and drug dose in the studied pediatric population ) .
On a mg / m2 basis , 30 mg / kg dose in the neonatal rat ( 135 mg / m2 ) and 10 mg / kg dose in the neonatal dog ( 79 mg / m2 ) are approximately 0 . 5 and 0 . 3 times , respectively , the recommended dose in the pediatric patients with an average body weight of 25 kg .
Phospholipidosis , similar to that seen in the adult animals , is reversible after cessation of azithromycin treatment .
The significance of these findings for animals and for humans is unknown .
