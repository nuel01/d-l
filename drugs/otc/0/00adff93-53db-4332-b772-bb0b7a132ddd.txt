6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adult Ulcerative Colitis During clinical development , 259 adult patients with active ulcerative colitis were exposed to 6 . 75 g / day Balsalazide Disodium in 4 controlled trials .
In the 4 controlled clinical trials patients receiving a Balsalazide Disodium capsules dose of 6 . 75 g / day most frequently reported the following adverse reactions : headache ( 8 % ) , abdominal pain ( 6 % ) , diarrhea ( 5 % ) , nausea ( 5 % ) , vomiting ( 4 % ) , respiratory infection ( 4 % ) , and arthralgia ( 4 % ) .
Withdrawal from therapy due to adverse reactions was comparable among patients on Balsalazide Disodium capsules and placebo .
Adverse reactions reported by 1 % or more of patients who participated in the 4 well - controlled , Phase 3 trials are presented by treatment group ( Table 1 ) .
The number of placebo patients ( 35 ) , however , is too small for valid comparisons .
Some adverse reactions , such as abdominal pain , fatigue , and nausea were reported more frequently in women than in men .
Abdominal pain , rectal bleeding , and anemia can be part of the clinical presentation of ulcerative colitis .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of seriousness , frequency of reporting , or potential causal connection to balsalazide .
Hepatic Postmarketing adverse reactions of hepatotoxicity have been reported for products which contain ( or are metabolized to ) mesalamine , including elevated liver function tests ( SGOT / AST , SGPT / ALT , GGT , LDH , alkaline phosphatase , bilirubin ) , jaundice , cholestatic jaundice , cirrhosis , hepatocellular damage including liver necrosis and liver failure .
Some of these cases were fatal ; however , no fatalities associated with these adverse reactions were reported in Balsalazide Disodium capsules clinical trials .
One case of Kawasaki - like syndrome which included hepatic function changes was also reported , however , this adverse reaction was not reported in Balsalazide Disodium capsules clinical trials .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes , balsalazide and its metabolites [ 5 - aminosalicylic acid ( 5 - ASA ) , N - acetyl - 5 - aminosalicylic acid ( N - Ac - 5 - ASA ) , 4 - aminobenzoyl - ß - alanine ( 4 - ABA ) and N - acetyl - 4 - aminobenzoyl - ß - alanine ( N - Ac - 4 - ABA ) ] were not shown to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated ( CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 / 5 ) .
Therefore , balsalazide and its metabolites are not expected to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs which are substrates of CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , or CYP3A4 / 5 .
In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes , balsalazide and its metabolites were not shown to inhibit the major CYP enzymes evaluated ( CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 / 5 ) .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal impairment : Use Balsalazide Disodium capsules with caution in patients with a history of renal disease .
( 5 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Reproduction studies were performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 2 g / kg / day , 2 . 4 and 4 . 7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area for the rat and rabbit , respectively , and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to balsalazide disodium .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether balsalazide disodium is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Balsalazide Disodium capsules are administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Use of Balsalazide Disodium capsules in pediatric and adolescent patients 5 to 17 years of age for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis is supported by : • • extrapolation of results from clinical studies that supported the approval of Balsalazide Disodium capsules for adults .
• • a clinical trial of 68 patients ages 5 - 17 years comparing two doses of Balsalazide Disodium capsules ( 6 . 75 g / day and 2 . 25 g / day ) , and • • a pharmacokinetic study performed on a subset of the pediatric study population .
[ See Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Based on the limited data available , dosing can be initiated at either 6 . 75 or 2 . 25 g / day .
Safety and efficacy of Balsalazide Disodium capsules in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years have not been established .
10 OVERDOSAGE No case of overdose has occurred with Balsalazide Disodium capsules .
A 3 - year - old boy is reported to have ingested 2 g of another mesalamine product .
He was treated with ipecac and activated charcoal with no adverse reactions .
If an overdose occurs with Balsalazide Disodium capsules , treatment should be supportive , with particular attention to correction of electrolyte abnormalities .
11 DESCRIPTION Each Balsalazide Disodium capsule contains 750 mg of balsalazide disodium , a prodrug that is enzymatically cleaved in the colon to produce mesalamine ( 5 - aminosalicylic acid or 5 - ASA ) , an anti - inflammatory drug .
Each capsule of Balsalazide Disodium ( 750 mg ) is equivalent to 267 mg of mesalamine .
Balsalazide disodium has the chemical name ( E ) - 5 - [ [ - 4 - [ [ ( 2 - carboxethyl ) amino ] carbonyl ] phenyl ] azo ] - 2 - hydroxybenzoic acid , disodium salt , dihydrate .
Its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Weight : 437 . 32 Molecular Formula : C17H13N3O6Na2 ● 2H2O Balsalazide disodium is a stable , odorless orange to yellow microcrystalline powder .
It is freely soluble in water and isotonic saline , sparingly soluble in methanol and ethanol , and practically insoluble in all other organic solvents .
Inactive Ingredients : Each hard gelatin capsule contains colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate .
The sodium content of each capsule is approximately 86 mg .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Balsalazide disodium is delivered intact to the colon where it is cleaved by bacterial azoreduction to release equimolar quantities of mesalamine , which is the therapeutically active portion of the molecule , and the 4 - aminobenzoyl - ß - alanine carrier moiety .
The carrier moiety released when balsalazide disodium is cleaved is only minimally absorbed and is largely inert .
The mechanism of action of 5 - ASA is unknown , but appears to be local to the colonic mucosa rather than systemic .
Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites , both through the cyclooxygenase pathways , i . e . , prostanoids , and through the lipoxygenase pathways , i . e . , leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids , is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease , and it is possible that 5 - ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites in the colon .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Balsalazide Disodium capsules contain a powder of balsalazide disodium that is insoluble in acid and designed to be delivered to the colon as the intact prodrug .
Upon reaching the colon , bacterial azoreductases cleave the compound to release 5 - ASA , the therapeutically active portion of the molecule , and 4 - aminobenzoyl - ß - alanine .
The 5 - ASA is further metabolized to yield N - acetyl - 5 - aminosalicylic acid ( N - Ac - 5 - ASA ) , a second key metabolite .
Absorption The plasma pharmacokinetics of balsalazide and its key metabolites from a crossover study in healthy volunteers are summarized in Table 3 .
In this study , a single oral dose of Balsalazide Disodium capsules 2 . 25 g was administered to healthy volunteers as intact capsules ( 3 x 750 mg ) under fasting conditions , as intact capsules ( 3 x 750 mg ) after a high - fat meal , and unencapsulated ( 3 x 750 mg ) as sprinkles on applesauce .
Table 3 : Plasma Pharmacokinetics for Balsalazide and Key Metabolites ( 5 — ASA and N - Ac - 5 - ASA ) with Administration of Balsalazide Disodium Capsules Following a Fast , a High - Fat Meal , and Drug Contents Sprinkled on Applesauce ( Mean ± SD ) Fasting n = 17 High - fat Meal n = 17 Sprinkled n = 17 Cmax ( µg / mL ) Balsalazide 0 . 51 ± 0 . 32 0 . 45 ± 0 . 39 0 . 21 ± 0 . 12 5 - ASA 0 . 22 ± 0 . 12 0 . 11 ± 0 . 136 0 . 29 ± 0 . 17 N - Ac - 5 - ASA 0 . 88 ± 0 . 39 0 . 64 ± 0 . 534 1 . 04 ± 0 . 57 AUClast ( µg · hr / mL ) Balsalazide 1 . 35 ± 0 . 73 1 . 52 ± 1 . 01 0 . 87 ± 0 . 48 5 - ASA 2 . 59 ± 1 . 46 2 . 10 ± 2 . 58 2 . 99 ± 1 . 70 N - Ac - 5 - ASA 17 . 8 ± 8 . 14 17 . 7 ± 13 . 7 20 . 0 ± 11 . 4 Tmax ( h ) Balsalazide 0 . 8 ± 0 . 85 1 . 2 ± 1 . 11 1 . 6 ± 0 . 44 5 - ASA 8 . 2 ± 1 . 98 22 . 0 ± 8 . 23 8 . 7 ± 1 . 99 N - Ac - 5 - ASA 9 . 9 ± 2 . 49 20 . 2 ± 8 . 94 10 . 8 ± 5 . 39 A relatively low systemic exposure was observed under all three administered conditions ( fasting , fed with high - fat meal , sprinkled on applesauce ) , which reflects the variable , but minimal absorption of balsalazide disodium and its metabolites .
The data indicate that both Cmax and AUClast were lower , while Tmax was markedly prolonged , under fed ( high - fat meal ) compared to fasted conditions .
Moreover , the data suggest that dosing balsalazide disodium as a sprinkle or as a capsule provides highly variable , but relatively similar mean pharmacokinetic parameter values .
No inference can be made as to how the systemic exposure differences of balsalazide and its metabolites in this study might predict the clinical efficacy under different dosing conditions ( i . e . , fasted , fed with high - fat meal , or sprinkled on applesauce ) since clinical efficacy after balsalazide disodium administration is presumed to be primarily due to the local effects of 5 - ASA on the colonic mucosa .
In a separate study of adult patients with ulcerative colitis , who received balsalazide , 1 . 5 g twice daily , for over 1 year , systemic drug exposure , based on mean AUC values , was up to 60 times greater ( 0 . 008 µg ● hr / mL to 0 . 480 µg ● hr / mL ) when compared to that obtained in healthy subjects who received the same dose .
Distribution The binding of balsalazide to human plasma proteins was ≥ 99 % .
Metabolism The products of the azoreduction of this compound , 5 - ASA and 4 - aminobenzoyl - ß - alanine , and their N - acetylated metabolites have been identified in plasma , urine and feces .
Elimination Following single - dose administration of 2 . 25 g Balsalazide Disodium ( three 750 mg capsules ) under fasting conditions in healthy subjects , mean urinary recovery of balsalazide , 5 - ASA , and N - Ac - 5 - ASA was 0 . 20 % , 0 . 22 % and 10 . 2 % , respectively .
In a multiple - dose study in healthy subjects receiving a Balsalazide Disodium dose of two 750 mg capsules twice daily ( 3 g / day ) for 10 days , mean urinary recovery of balsalazide , 5 - ASA , and N - Ac - 5 - ASA was 0 . 1 % , 0 % , and 11 . 3 % , respectively .
During this study , subjects received their morning dose 0 . 5 hours after being fed a standard meal , and subjects received their evening dose 2 hours after being fed a standard meal .
In a study with 10 healthy volunteers , 65 % of a single 2 . 25 - gram dose of Balsalazide Disodium capsules was recovered as 5 - ASA , 4 - aminobenzoyl - ß - alanine , and the N - acetylated metabolites in feces , while < 1 % of the dose was recovered as parent compound .
In a study that examined the disposition of balsalazide in patients who were taking 3 - 6 g of Balsalazide Disodium capsules daily for more than 1 year and who were in remission from ulcerative colitis , less than 1 % of an oral dose was recovered as intact balsalazide in the urine .
Less than 4 % of the dose was recovered as 5 - ASA , while virtually no 4 - aminobenzoyl - ß - alanine was detected in urine .
The mean urinary recovery of N - Ac - 5 - ASA and N - acetyl - 4 - aminobenzoyl - ß - alanine comprised < 16 % and < 12 % of the balsalazide dose , respectively .
No fecal recovery studies were performed in this population .
Pediatric Population In studies of pediatric patients with mild - to - moderate active ulcerative colitis receiving three 750 mg Balsalazide Disodium capsules 3 times daily ( 6 . 75 g / day ) for 8 weeks , steady state was reached within 2 weeks , as observed in adult patients .
Likewise , the pharmacokinetics of balsalazide , 5 - ASA , and N - Ac - 5 - ASA were characterized by very large inter - patient variability , which is also similar to that seen in adult patients .
The pro - drug moiety , balsalazide , appeared to exhibit dose - independent ( i . e . , dose - linear ) kinetics in children , and the systemic exposure parameters ( Cmax and AUC0 - 8 ) increased in an almost dose - proportional fashion after the 6 . 75 g / day versus the 2 . 25 g / day doses .
However , the absolute magnitude of these exposure parameters was greater relative to adults .
The Cmax and AUC0 - 8 observed in pediatric patients were 26 % and 102 % greater than those observed in adult patients at the 6 . 75 g / day dosage level .
In contrast , the systemic exposure parameters for the active metabolites , 5 - ASA and N - Ac - 5 - ASA , in pediatric patients increased in a less than dose - proportional manner after the 6 . 75 g / day dose versus the 2 . 25 g / day dose .
Additionally , the magnitude of these exposure parameters was decreased for both metabolites relative to adults .
For the metabolite of key safety concern from a systemic exposure perspective , 5 - ASA , the Cmax and AUC0 - 8 observed in pediatric patients were 67 % and 64 % lower than those observed in adult patients at the 6 . 75 g / day dosage level .
Likewise , for N - Ac - 5 - ASA , the Cmax and AUC0 - 8 observed in pediatric patients were 68 % and 55 % lower than those observed in adult patients at the 6 . 75 g / day dosage level .
All pharmacokinetic studies with Balsalazide Disodium capsules are characterized by large variability in the plasma concentration versus time profiles for balsalazide and its metabolites , thus half - life estimates of these analytes are indeterminate .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 24 - month rat ( Sprague Dawley ) carcinogenicity study , oral ( dietary ) balsalazide disodium at doses up to 2 g / kg / day was not tumorigenic .
For a 50 kg person of average height this dose represents 2 . 4 times the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis .
Balsalazide disodium was not genotoxic in the following in vitro or in vivo tests : Ames test , human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test , and mouse lymphoma cell ( L5178Y / TK + / - ) forward mutation test , or mouse micronucleus test .
However , it was genotoxic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell ( CH V79 / HGPRT ) forward mutation test .
4 - aminobenzoyl - ß - alanine , a metabolite of balsalazide disodium , was not genotoxic in the Ames test and the mouse lymphoma cell ( L5178Y / TK + / - ) forward mutation test but was positive in the human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test .
N - acetyl - 4 - aminobenzoyl - ß - alanine , a conjugated metabolite of balsalazide disodium , was not genotoxic in Ames test , the mouse lymphoma cell ( L5178Y / TK + / - ) forward mutation test , or the human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test .
Balsalazide disodium at oral doses up to 2 g / kg / day , 2 . 4 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area , was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance in rats .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology Renal Toxicity In animal studies conducted at doses up to 2000 mg / kg ( approximately 21 times the recommended 6 . 75 g / day dose on a mg / kg basis for a 70 kg person ) , Balsalazide Disodium demonstrated no nephrotoxic effects in rats or dogs .
Overdosage A single oral dose of balsalazide disodium at 5 g / kg or 4 - aminobenzoyl - ß - alanine , a metabolite of balsalazide disodium , at 1 g / kg was non - lethal in mice and rats .
No symptoms of acute toxicity were seen at these doses .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Adult Studies Two randomized , double - blind studies were conducted in adults .
In the first trial , 103 patients with active mild - to - moderate ulcerative colitis with sigmoidoscopy findings of friable or spontaneously bleeding mucosa were randomized and treated with balsalazide 6 . 75 g / day or balsalazide 2 . 25 g / day .
The primary efficacy endpoint was reduction of rectal bleeding and improvement of at least one of the other assessed symptoms ( stool frequency , patient functional assessment , abdominal pain , sigmoidoscopic grade , and physician ’ s global assessment [ PGA ] ) .
Outcome assessment for rectal bleeding at each interim period ( week 2 , 4 , and 8 ) encompassed a 4 - day period ( 96 hours ) .
Results demonstrated a statistically significant difference between high and low doses of Balsalazide Disodium capsules ( Figure 1 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] A second study , conducted in Europe , confirmed findings of symptomatic improvement .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Pediatric Studies A clinical trial was conducted comparing two doses ( 6 . 75 g / day and 2 . 25 g / day ) of Balsalazide Disodium capsules in 68 pediatric patients ( age 5 to 17 , 23 males and 45 females ) with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis .
28 / 33 ( 85 % ) patients randomized to 6 . 75 g / day and 25 / 35 ( 71 % ) patients randomized to 2 . 25 g / day completed the study .
The primary endpoint for this study was the proportion of subjects with clinical improvement ( defined as a reduction of at least 3 points in the Modified Sutherland Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [ MUCAI ] from baseline to 8 weeks ) .
Fifteen ( 45 % ) patients in the Balsalazide Disodium capsules 6 . 75 g / day group and 13 ( 37 % ) patients in the Balsalazide Disodium capsules 2 . 25 g / day group showed this clinical improvement .
In both groups , patients with higher MUCAI total scores at baseline were likely to experience greater improvement .
Rectal bleeding improved in 64 % of patients treated with Balsalazide Disodium capsules 6 . 75 g / day and 54 % of patients treated with Balsalazide Disodium capsules 2 . 25 g / day .
Colonic mucosal appearance upon endoscopy improved in 61 % of patients treated with Balsalazide Disodium capsules 6 . 75 g / day and 46 % of patients treated with Balsalazide Disodium capsules 2 . 25 g / day .
