STRENSIQ is a tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase indicated for the treatment of patients with perinatal / infantile - and juvenile - onset hypophosphatasia ( HPP ) .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Perinatal / Infantile - Onset HPP ( 2 . 1 ) • Recommended dosage regimen is 2 mg / kg administered subcutaneously three times per week , or 1 mg / kg administered six times per week .
Injection site reactions may limit the tolerability of the six times per week regimen .
• The dose may be increased to 3 mg / kg three times per week for insufficient efficacy .
Juvenile - Onset HPP ( 2 . 2 ) • Recommended dosage regimen is 2 mg / kg administered subcutaneously three times per week , or 1 mg / kg administered six times per week .
Injection site reactions may limit the tolerability of the six times per week regimen .
Preparation and Weight - Based Dosing ( 2 . 3 ) : • Caution : Do not use the 80 mg / 0 . 8 mL vial in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg because the systemic asfotase alfa exposure achieved with the 80 mg / 0 . 8 mL vial ( higher concentration ) is lower than that achieved with the other strength vials ( lower concentration ) .
A lower exposure may not be adequate for this subgroup of patients .
• See full prescribing information for tables of weight - based dosing by treatment regimen .
Administration ( 2 . 4 ) : • For subcutaneous injection only .
• Rotate injection sites .
Do not administer to areas that are reddened , inflamed or swollen .
2 . 1 Dosage for Perinatal / Infantile - Onset HPP The recommended dosage regimen of STRENSIQ for the treatment of perinatal / infantile - onset HPP is 6 mg / kg per week administered subcutaneously as either : • 2 mg / kg three times per week , or • 1 mg / kg six times per week .
Injection site reactions may limit the tolerability of the six times per week regimen [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The dose of STRENSIQ may be increased for lack of efficacy ( e . g . , no improvement in respiratory status , growth , or radiographic findings ) up to 9 mg / kg per week administered subcutaneously as 3 mg / kg three times per week .
2 . 2 Dosage for Juvenile - Onset HPP The recommended dosage regimen of STRENSIQ for the treatment of juvenile - onset HPP is 6 mg / kg per week administered subcutaneously as either : • 2 mg / kg three times per week , or • 1 mg / kg six times per week .
Injection site reactions may limit the tolerability of the six times per week regimen [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 3 Preparation and Weight - Based Dosing Tables Caution : Do not use the 80 mg / 0 . 8 mL vial of STRENSIQ in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg because the systemic exposure of asfotase alfa achieved with the 80 mg / 0 . 8 mL vial ( higher concentration ) is lower than that achieved with the other strength vials ( lower concentration ) .
A lower exposure may not be adequate for this subgroup of patients [ see Dosage Forms and Strengths ( 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
• 1 .
Determine the total weekly volume needed for the prescribed dosage based on the patient ' s weight and recommended dosage .
Follow these steps to determine the patient dose .
• Total weekly dose ( mg ) = patient ' s weight ( kg ) × prescribed dose ( mg / kg / week ) • Total injection volume ( mL ) per week = Total dose ( mg / week ) divided by the STRENSIQ concentration ( 40 mg / mL or 100 mg / mL ) .
Note product concentrations are : 40 mg / mL ( vial strengths 18 mg / 0 . 45 mL , 28 mg / 0 . 7 mL , 40 mg / mL ) or 100 mg / mL ( vial strength 80 mg / 0 . 8 mL ) .
• Round total injection volume to the nearest hundredth of a mL • Total number of vials per week = Total injection volume divided by vial volume ( mL ) • 2 .
Determine the number of injection days per week ( three or six per week ) .
• 3 .
Determine dose per injection day .
Patient weights should be rounded to the nearest kilogram when determining dose .
Use the following tables for guidance , for patients administering 2 mg / kg three times per week ( Table 1 ) , 1 mg / kg six times per week ( Table 2 ) and for dose escalations to 3 mg / kg three times per week , recommended only for patients with perinatal / infantile - onset HPP [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] ( Table 3 ) .

None .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity Reactions : Monitor and if a severe reaction occurs , discontinue treatment and initiate appropriate medical treatment .
( 5 . 1 ) • Lipodystrophy : Localized reactions were reported after several months of treatment ; follow proper injection technique and rotate injection sites .
( 5 . 2 ) • Ectopic Calcifications ( eye and kidneys ) : Monitor using ophthalmologic examinations and renal ultrasounds at baseline and periodically during treatment .
( 5 . 3 ) • Possible Immune - Mediated Clinical Effects : Evaluate patients for antibody formation if clinically indicated .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , have been reported in STRENSIQ - treated patients .
Signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis included difficulty breathing , choking sensation , nausea , periorbital edema , and dizziness .
These reactions have occurred within minutes after subcutaneous administration of STRENSIQ and have been observed more than 1 year after treatment initiation .
Other hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in STRENSIQ - treated patients , including vomiting , fever , headache , flushing , irritability , chills , erythema , rash , pruritus and oral hypoesthesia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs , discontinue STRENSIQ treatment and initiate appropriate medical treatment .
Consider the risks and benefits of re - administering STRENSIQ to individual patients following a severe reaction .
If the decision is made to re - administer the product , monitor patients for a reoccurrence of signs and symptoms of a severe hypersensitivity reaction .
5 . 2 Lipodystrophy Localized lipodystrophy , including lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy , has been reported at injection sites after several months in patients treated with STRENSIQ in clinical trials [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Advise patients to follow proper injection technique and to rotate injection sites [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 3 Ectopic Calcifications Patients with HPP are at increased risk for developing ectopic calcifications .
Events of ectopic calcification , including ophthalmic ( conjunctival and corneal ) and renal ( nephrocalcinosis , nephrolithiasis ) , have been reported in the clinical trial experience with STRENSIQ .
There was insufficient information to determine whether or not the reported events were consistent with the disease or due to STRENSIQ .
No visual changes or changes in renal function were reported resulting from the occurrence of ectopic calcifications .
Ophthalmology examinations and renal ultrasounds are recommended at baseline and periodically during treatment with STRENSIQ to monitor for signs and symptoms of ophthalmic and renal ectopic calcifications and for changes in vision or renal function .
5 . 4 Possible Immune - Mediated Clinical Effects In clinical trials , most STRENSIQ - treated patients developed anti - asfotase alfa antibodies and neutralizing antibodies which resulted in reduced systemic exposure of asfotase alfa [ see Immunogenicity ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
In postmarketing reports , some STRENSIQ - treated patients with initial therapeutic response subsequently developed recurrence and worsening in disease - associated laboratory and radiographic biomarkers ( some in association with neutralizing antibodies ) suggesting possible immune - mediated effects on STRENSIQ ' s pharmacologic action resulting in disease progression [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 3 ) ] .
The effect of anti - asfotase alfa antibody formation on the long - term efficacy of STRENSIQ is unknown .
There are no marketed anti - asfotase alfa antibody tests .
If patients experience progression of HPP symptoms or worsening of disease - associated laboratory and imaging biomarkers after a period of initial therapeutic response to STRENSIQ , consider obtaining anti - asfotase alfa antibody testing by contacting STRENSIQ Medical Information at Alexion at 1 - 888 - 765 - 4747 or by email at medinfo @ alexion . com .
Close clinical follow up is recommended .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling : • Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Lipodystrophy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Ectopic Calcifications [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Possible Immune - Mediated Clinical Effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 10 % ) are injection site reactions , lipodystrophy , ectopic calcifications and hypersensitivity reactions .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data described below reflect exposure to STRENSIQ in 99 patients with perinatal / infantile - or juvenile onset HPP ( age 1 day to 58 years ) treated with STRENSIQ , most for more than 2 years ( range 1 day to 312 weeks [ 78 months ] ) : 51 patients received at least 96 weeks ( 24 months ) of treatment and 39 patients received 168 weeks ( 42 months ) or more of treatment [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Common Adverse Reactions Overall , the most common adverse reactions reported were injection site reactions ( 63 % ) .
Other common adverse reactions included lipodystrophy ( 28 % ) , ectopic calcifications ( 14 % ) , and hypersensitivity reactions ( 12 % ) .
Table 4 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 10 % in clinical trials following subcutaneous injection of STRENSIQ by patient population and STRENSIQ dosage regimen .
The frequency of injection site reactions , lipodystrophy and ectopic calcification were higher in patients with juvenile - onset HPP as compared to perinatal / infantile - onset HPP patients .
The majority of injection site reactions resolved within a week .
Two patients experienced injection site reactions that led to reductions of their STRENSIQ dose .
One patient switched from six times per week dosing to 3 times per week dosing as a result of injection site reactions .
One other patient experienced a severe injection site reaction of injection site discoloration and withdrew from the trial .

[ 3 ] Other lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy .
[ 4 ] Other hypersensitivity reactions include erythema / redness , pyrexia / fever , irritability , nausea , pain , rigor / chills , hypoesthesia oral , headache , flushing , and anaphylaxis .
Less Common Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1 % included : • Hypocalcemia • Renal Stones • Chronic hepatitis • Decreased vitamin B6 Long - Term Safety In long - term extension trials reflecting a median exposure to STRENSIQ of 142 weeks ( range 0 . 1 weeks to 392 weeks ) in 112 patients with perinatal / infantile - ( n = 89 ) , juvenile - ( n = 22 ) , and adult - onset ( n = 1 ) HPP ( age at enrollment = 1 day to 66 . 5 years ) , the most common adverse reactions were similar to those reported in Table 4 .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of the antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other asfotase alfa products may be misleading .
During clinical trials , anti - asfotase alfa antibodies have been detected in patients receiving treatment with STRENSIQ using an electrochemiluminescent ( ECL ) immunoassay .
Antibody positive samples were tested to determine the presence of neutralizing antibodies based on in vitro inhibition of the catalytic activity of STRENSIQ .
Among STRENSIQ - treated patients with hypophosphatasia ( HPP ) in clinical studies who had post - baseline antibody data available , 97 / 109 ( 89 % ) tested positive for anti - asfotase alfa antibodies at some time point during STRENSIQ treatment .
Among those 97 patients , 55 ( 57 % ) also tested positive for neutralizing antibodies at some time point during STRENSIQ treatment .
No correlation was observed between the anti - asfotase alfa antibody titers and the neutralizing antibody ( % inhibition ) values .
Formation of anti - asfotase alfa antibody resulted in a reduced systemic exposure of asfotase alfa [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of STRENSIQ .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Some STRENSIQ - treated patients with initial therapeutic response to STRENSIQ subsequently developed worsening in disease - associated laboratory and radiographic biomarkers ( some in association with neutralizing antibodies ) suggesting possible immune - mediated effects on STRENSIQ ' s pharmacologic action resulting in disease progression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Drug Interference with Laboratory Tests : Alkaline Phosphatase ( ALP ) is used as a detection reagent in many laboratory tests and the presence of asfotase alfa in clinical laboratory samples could result in erroneous test results .
Inform laboratory personnel and discuss use of an alternative testing platform for patients on treatment .
( 7 . 1 ) • Serum Alkaline Phosphatase : Serum ALP measurements are expected to be elevated during treatment and may be unreliable for clinical decision making .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Drug Interference with Laboratory Tests Laboratory Tests Utilizing Alkaline Phosphatase as a Detection Reagent Studies have shown that there is analytical interference between asfotase alfa and laboratory tests that utilize an alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) - conjugated test system , rendering erroneous test results in patients treated with STRENSIQ .
ALP - conjugated test systems are utilized to measure substances such as hormones , bacterial antigens and antibodies .
Therefore , it is recommended that laboratory assays which do not have ALP - conjugate technology be used when testing samples from patients who are receiving STRENSIQ .
To avoid erroneous test results for patients treated with STRENSIQ , inform laboratory personnel that the patient is being treated with STRENSIQ and discuss the use of a testing platform which does not utilize an ALP - conjugated test system .
Serum Alkaline Phosphatase High serum ALP measurements detected through clinical laboratory testing are expected in patients receiving STRENSIQ and reflect circulating concentrations of asfotase alfa .
Do not rely on serum ALP measurements for clinical decision making in patients treated with STRENSIQ .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on STRENSIQ use in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk .
In animal reproduction studies , asfotase alfa administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis showed no evidence of fetotoxicity , embryolethality or teratogenicity at doses causing plasma exposures up to 21 and 24 times , respectively , the exposure at the recommended human dose ( see Data ) .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Asfotase alfa administered during the period of organogenesis to rats ( from gestation Day 6 to Day 19 post - partum ) and rabbits ( on gestation days 7 to 19 ) at intravenous doses up to 50 mg / kg / day , approximately 21 and 24 times the human AUC of 65486 ng . h / mL at 2 mg / kg dose administered three times weekly for a 50 kg individual , respectively did not cause any adverse effects on embryofetal development .
A pre - and post - natal development study in pregnant rats showed no evidence of adverse effects on pre - and post - natal development at intravenous doses ( from Day 6 of gestation to Day 19 postpartum ) of asfotase alfa up to 50 mg / kg / day approximately 21 times the human AUC of 65486 ng . h / mL at 2 mg / kg dose administered three times weekly for a 50 kg individual .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of asfotase alfa in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for STRENSIQ and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from asfotase alfa or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of STRENSIQ for the treatment of perinatal / infantile - and juvenile - onset HPP have been established in pediatric patients .
Use of STRENSIQ for this indication is based on 4 prospective , open - label clinical trials conducted in 89 pediatric patients with perinatal / infantile - onset or juvenile - onset HPP [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No patients with perinatal / infantile - or juvenile - onset HPP aged 65 years were enrolled in clinical trials of STRENSIQ .
Therefore , there is no information available to determine whether patients aged 65 years and over respond differently from younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION Asfotase alfa is a tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase ( TNSALP ) produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line .
Asfotase alfa is a soluble glycoprotein composed of two identical polypeptide chains .
Each chain contains 726 amino acids with a theoretical mass of 161 kDa .
Each chain consists of the catalytic domain of human TNSALP , the human immunoglobulin G1 Fc domain and a deca - aspartate peptide used as a bone targeting domain .
The two polypeptide chains are covalently linked by two disulfide bonds .
STRENSIQ ( asfotase alfa ) injection is a sterile , preservative - free , nonpyrogenic , clear , slightly opalescent or opalescent , colorless to slightly yellow , with few small translucent or white particles , aqueous solution for subcutaneous administration .
STRENSIQ is supplied in glass single - dose vials containing asfotase alfa ; dibasic sodium phosphate , heptahydrate ; monobasic sodium phosphate , monohydrate ; and sodium chloride at a pH between 7 . 2 and 7 . 6 .
Table 5 describes the content of STRENSIQ vial presentations .

TNSALP is a metallo - enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters with release of inorganic phosphate and alcohol .
Elevated extracellular levels of PPi block hydroxyapatite crystal growth which inhibits bone mineralization and causes an accumulation of unmineralized bone matrix which manifests as rickets and bone deformation in infants and children and as osteomalacia ( softening of bones ) once growth plates close , along with muscle weakness .
Replacement of the TNSALP enzyme upon STRENSIQ treatment reduces the enzyme substrate levels .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Perinatal / infantile - and juvenile - onset HPP patients treated with STRENSIQ had reductions in plasma TNSALP substrates , PPi and pyridoxal 5 ' - phosphate ( PLP ) within 6 to 12 weeks of treatment .
Reductions in plasma PPi and PLP levels did not correlate with clinical outcomes .
Bone biopsy data from perinatal / infantile - onset and juvenile - onset HPP patients treated with STRENSIQ demonstrated decreases in osteoid volume and thickness indicating improved bone mineralization .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Based on data in 38 HPP patients , the pharmacokinetics of asfotase alfa exhibit dose proportionality across the dose range of 0 . 3 mg / kg to 3 mg / kg once every other day ( three times a week ) and appear to be time - independent .
Steady state exposure was achieved as early as three weeks after the administration of the first dose .
The elimination half - life following subcutaneous administration was approximately 5 days .
Table 6 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters following multiple doses in 20 HPP patients after subcutaneous administration of STRENSIQ at 2 mg / kg three times per week in Study 2 ( age of less than or equal to 5 years ) and Study 3 ( age of greater than 5 to 12 years ) , indicating the pharmacokinetics were similar between patients in the two age groups .
Table 6 : Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Multiple Subcutaneous Administration of STRENSIQ 2 mg / kg Three Times per Week Study 2 Study 3 Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation ( range ) .

Population PK analysis of asfotase alfa concentrations supports weight - based dosing because body weight is a major covariate of asfotase alfa clearance .
The formulation concentration had an impact on the systemic exposure of asfotase alfa in HPP patients .
The higher concentration formulation ( 80 mg / 0 . 8 mL vial ) achieved an approximately 25 % lower systemic asfotase alfa exposure ( i . e . , concentrations and AUC ) compared to the lower concentration formulations ( 18 mg / 0 . 45 mL , 28 mg / 0 . 7 mL or 40 mg / mL vials ) at the same dose of STRENSIQ [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Anti - Drug Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics Formation of anti - drug antibodies resulted in reduced systemic exposure of asfotase alfa .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential or studies to evaluate mutagenic potential have not been performed with asfotase alfa .
Asfotase alfa at intravenous doses up to 50 mg / kg / day administered daily in pregnant rats ( approximately 21 times the human AUC of 65486 ng . h / mL at 2 mg / kg dose administered three times weekly for a 50 kg individual ) was found to have no adverse effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Perinatal / Infantile - Onset HPP Study 1 was a 24 - week prospective single - arm trial in 11 patients with severe perinatal / infantile - onset HPP .
In this study , 7 / 11 ( 64 % ) were female and 10 / 11 ( 91 % ) patients were white , and age ranged from 3 weeks to 39 . 5 months .
Severe perinatal / infantile - onset HPP was defined as biochemical , medical history and radiographic evidence of HPP as well as the presence of any of the following : rachitic chest deformity , vitamin B6 - dependent seizures , or failure to thrive .
Ten of 11 patients completed the 24 - week trial and continued treatment in the extension phase .
Nine patients have been treated for at least 216 weeks ( 54 months ) and 4 patients have been treated for over 240 weeks ( 60 months ) .
Patients received subcutaneous STRENSIQ 3 mg / kg per week for the first month ; subsequently , dose increases up to 9 mg / kg per week were allowed for changes in weight and / or for lack of efficacy .
All 10 patients required dose increases up to 6 mg / kg per week or higher ; 9 patients increased between 4 and 24 weeks after starting treatment and 1 patient increased after 70 weeks due to suboptimal clinical response .
One patient ' s dose was decreased from 9 mg / kg per week to 6 mg / kg per week based on PK data .
Study 2 was a prospective open - label study in 59 patients with perinatal / infantile - onset HPP .
In this study , 32 / 59 ( 54 % ) were female , 46 / 59 ( 78 % ) were white , and age ranged from 1 day to 78 months .
Patients received subcutaneous STRENSIQ at 6 mg / kg per week for the first 4 weeks .
Ten patients received dose increases higher than 6 mg / kg per week due to suboptimal clinical response , with dose increases occurring between 8 and 24 weeks after starting treatment .
The recommended dosage regimen of STRENSIQ for the treatment of perinatal / infantile - onset HPP is up to 9 mg / kg per week administered subcutaneously as 3 mg / kg three times per week [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Forty - one patients were treated for at least 24 weeks ( 6 months ) and 15 patients were treated for at least 96 weeks ( 24 months ) .
Survival and Ventilation - Free Survival in Perinatal / Infantile - Onset HPP Survival and invasive ventilation - free survival were compared in STRENSIQ - treated patients ( Studies 1 and 2 ) with a historical cohort of untreated patients with similar clinical characteristics ( Table 7 and Figure 1 ) .

Long - Term Extension Trials in Perinatal / Infantile - Onset HPP Long - term data were collected in 68 STRENSIQ - treated patients with perinatal / infantile onset HPP in Studies 1 and 2 and an additional 10 patients enrolled in Study 2 .
The longest duration of follow - up in the 78 patients was 7 years ( 84 months ) .
At point of last contact , 69 / 78 ( 88 % ) STRENSIQ - treated patients had survived .
14 . 2 Juvenile - Onset HPP Study 3 was a prospective open - label 24 - week trial that included 8 juvenile - onset HPP patients and 5 perinatal / infantile - onset HPP patients ; 11 / 13 ( 85 % ) were male and 12 / 13 ( 92 % ) were white [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
On study entry , patients were 6 to 12 years of age .
All 8 juvenile - onset patients entered the extension study and were treated for at least 48 months .
At trial entry , patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous STRENSIQ 6 mg / kg per week or 9 mg / kg per week .
Two patients received dose reductions during the primary treatment period , including one patient who experienced a decrease in vitamin B6 levels and one patient who experienced recurrent injection site reactions .
During the extension phase , the dosing regimen for all patients was initially changed to 3 mg / kg per week .
Dosing was subsequently increased to 6 mg / kg per week , with no patients requiring doses higher than 6 mg / kg per week .
The recommended dosage regimen of STRENSIQ for the treatment of juvenile - onset HPP is 6 mg / kg per week [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Growth in Juvenile - Onset HPP Height and weight measurements ( as measured by Z - scores ) in 8 STRENSIQ - treated juvenile - onset HPP patients were compared with a historical cohort of 32 untreated patients with similar clinical characteristics ( Table 9 ) .
Height and weight data for historical patients were collected from medical records .

Skeletal Manifestations in Juvenile - Onset HPP Radiographs from 8 STRENSIQ - treated juvenile - onset HPP patients and 32 historical controls were compared to assess HPP - related rickets using the 7 - point RGI - C ( Radiographic Global Impression of Change ) scale .
Patients who achieved a RGI - C score of 2 or higher ( corresponding to substantial healing of rickets ) were classified as being responders to treatment .
All 8 treated patients were rated as responders by Month 54 of treatment .
The mean duration between the baseline and last RGI - C assessments for control patients was 56 months ( range was 8 to 95 months ) .
At last assessment , 2 / 32 ( 6 % ) of control patients were rated as responders .
Eight of 20 ( 40 % ) patients with juvenile - onset HPP experienced new fractures during the course of treatment .
There were insufficient data to assess the effect of STRENSIQ on fractures .
Gait / Mobility in Juvenile - Onset HPP Gait was assessed using a modified Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment - Gait ( MPOMA - G ) scale in 8 STRENSIQ - treated juvenile - onset HPP patients at 6 - month intervals out to 36 months .
Mobility was also assessed using the 6 Minute Walk Test ( 6 MWT ) in 7 of the 8 patients .
Step length improved by at least 1 point in either foot in 6 / 8 patients compared to 1 / 6 ( 17 % ) control patients .
The proportion of patients who had 6 MWT percent predicted values within the normal range for age , sex , and height - matched peers increased from 0 / 8 patients at baseline to 6 / 6 patients ( 100 % ) by Month 48 and all 6 were also able to walk longer distances at this time point compared to baseline .
Long - Term Extension Trials in Juvenile - Onset HPP Long - term data were collected in 8 patients with juvenile - onset HPP treated with STRENSIQ for at least 6 years ( 72 months ) .
At last assessment , 7 patients with available 6 MWT results had maintained improvements in gait / mobility .
