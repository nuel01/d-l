PHARMACY BULK PACKAGE - NOT FOR DIRECT INFUSION To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ampicillin and other antibacterial drugs , ampicillin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria .
DESCRIPTION Ampicillin for Injection , USP the monosodium salt of [ 2 S - [ 2α , 5α , 6β ( S * ) ] ] - 6 - [ ( aminophenylacetyl ) amino ] - 3 , 3 - dimethyl - 7 - oxo - 4 - thia - 1 - azabicyclo [ 3 . 2 . 0 ] heptane - 2 - carboxylic acid , is a synthetic penicillin .
It is an antibacterial agent with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against both penicillin - susceptible Gram - positive organisms and many common Gram - negative pathogens .
Ampicillin for Injection , USP is white to off - white crystalline powder .
The reconstituted solution is clear , colorless and free from visible particulates .
Each vial of Ampicillin for Injection , USP Pharmacy Bulk Package contains ampicillin sodium equivalent to 10 grams of ampicillin .
The sodium content is 65 . 83 mg ( 2 . 86 mEq ) per gram of ampicillin .
A pharmacy bulk package is a container of a sterile preparation for parenteral use that contains many single doses .
The contents of this pharmacy bulk package are intended for use by a pharmacy admixture service for addition to suitable parenteral fluids in the preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Directions For Proper Use of Pharmacy Bulk Package ) .
It has the following molecular structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular formula is CI6Hl8N3Na04S , and the molecular weight is 371 . 39 .
The pH range of the reconstituted solution is 8 to 10 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Ampicillin for Injection , USP diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids .
However , penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain occurs only when the meninges are inflamed .
Ampicillin is excreted largely unchanged in the urine and its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid .
Due to maturational changes in renal function , ampicillin half - life decreases as postmenstrual age ( a sum of gestational age and postnatal age ) increases for infants with postnatal age of less than 28 days .
The active form appears in the bile in higher concentrations than those found in serum .
Ampicillin is the least serum - bound of all the penicillins , averaging about 20 % compared to approximately 60 to 90 % for other penicillins .
Ampicillin for Injection , USP is well - tolerated by most patients and has been given in doses of 2 grams daily for many weeks without adverse reactions .
Microbiology While in vitro studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following organisms , clinical efficacy for infections other than those included in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section has not been demonstrated .
Antibacterial Activity The following bacteria have been shown in in vitro studies to be susceptible to Ampicillin for Injection , USP : Gram - positive Bacteria Hemolytic and nonhemolytic streptococci Streptococcus pneumoniae Nonpenicillinase - producing staphylococci Clostridium spp .
B . anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Most strains of enterococci .
Gram - negative Bacteria H . influenzae N . gonorrhoeae N . meningitidis Proteus mirabilis Many strains of Salmonella , Shigella , and E . coli .
AMPICILLIN does not resist destruction by penicillinase .
Susceptibility Test Methods Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
One such standardized procedure1 , 2 that has been recommended for use with disks to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to ampicillin , uses the 10 mcg ampicillin disk .
Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) for ampicillin .
Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single - disk susceptibility test with a 10 mcg ampicillin disk should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1 .
Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods that are used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
One such standardized procedures1 , 3 uses a standardized dilution method ( broth or agar ) or equivalent with ampicillin powder .
The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1 .
• TABLE 1 : SUSCEPTIBILITY TEST INTERPRETIVE CRITERIA • Susceptibility Test Result Interpretive Criteria • Pathogen • Disk diffusion ( Zone diameter in mm ) • Minimal Inhibitory Concentration ( MIC in mcg / mL ) • S • I • R • S • I • R • Enterobacteriaceae • ≥ 17 • 14 to 16 • ≤ 13 • ≤ 8 • 16 • ≥ 32 • Enterococcus spp .

Susceptibility of staphylococci to ampicillin may be deduced from testing only penicillin and either cefoxitin or oxacillin .
A report of “ Susceptible ” ( S ) indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited by usually achievable concentrations of the antimicrobial compound in the blood .
A report of “ Intermediate ” ( I ) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal , if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative , clinically feasible drugs , the test should be repeated .
This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of the drug can be used .
This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation .
A report of “ Resistant ” ( R ) indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable ; other therapy should be selected .
Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms1 , 2 , 3 .
The 10 mcg ampicillin disk and the standard ampicillin powder should provide respectively the following zone diameters and MIC values in these laboratory test quality control strains : • TABLE 2 : ACCEPTABLE QUALITY CONTROL RANGES • Acceptable Quality Control Ranges • Disk diffusion • Minimal Inhibitory • ( Zone diameter ranges in mm ) • Concentration Range • Microorganism • ( MIC in mcg / mL ) • Enterococcus faecalis • 0 . 5 to 2 • ATCC ® 29212 • Escherichia coli • 16 to 22 • 2 to 8 • ATCC ® 25922 • Escherichia coli ATCC ® 35218 • 6 • > 32 • Haemophilus influenzae • 13 to 21 • 2 to 8 • ATCC ® 49247 • Staphylococcus aureus • 27 to 35 • - • ATCC ® 25923 • Staphylococcus aureus • - • 0 . 5 to 2 • ATCC ® 29213 • Streptococcus pneumoniae • 30 to 36 • 0 . 06 to 0 . 25 • ATCC ® 49619 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ampicillin for Injection , USP is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the following conditions : Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus ( penicillinase and nonpenicillinase - producing ) , H . influenzae , and Group A beta - hemolytic streptococci .
Bacterial Meningitis caused by E . coli , Group B streptococci , and other Gram - negative bacteria ( Listeria monocytogenes , N . meningitidis ) .
The addition of an aminoglycoside with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness against Gram - negative bacteria .
Septicemia and Endocarditis caused by susceptible Gram - positive organisms including Streptococcus spp . , penicillin G - susceptible staphylococci , and enterococci .
Gram - negative sepsis caused by E . coli , Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella spp .
responds to ampicillin .
Endocarditis due to enterococcal strains usually respond to intravenous therapy .
The addition of an aminoglycoside may enhance the effectiveness of ampicillin when treating streptococcal endocarditis .
Urinary Tract Infections caused by sensitive strains of E . coli and Proteus mirabilis .
Gastrointestinal Infections caused by Salmonella typhi ( typhoid fever ) , other Salmonella spp . , and Shigella spp .
( dysentery ) usually respond to oral or intravenous therapy .
Bacteriology studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to ampicillin should be performed .
Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing .
It is advisable to reserve the parenteral form of this drug for moderately severe and severe infections and for patients who are unable to take the oral forms .
A change to oral ampicillin may be made as soon as appropriate .
To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ampicillin for Injection , USP and other antibacterial drugs , Ampicillin for Injection , USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
Indicated surgical procedures should be performed .
CONTRAINDICATIONS A history of a previous hypersensitivity reaction to any of the penicillins is a contraindication .
WARNINGS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity ( anaphylactoid ) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy .
Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy , it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins .
These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and / or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens .
There have been well - documented reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity reactions who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with a cephalosporin .
Before initiating therapy with a penicillin , careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins , cephalosporins , and other allergens .
If an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
SERIOUS ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE , OXYGEN , INTRAVENOUS STEROIDS , AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT , INCLUDING INTUBATION , SHOULD ALSO BE ADMINISTERED AS INDICATED .
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including ampicillin for injection , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of superinfections with mycotic organisms or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy .
In such cases , discontinue the drug and substitute appropriate treatment .
A high percentage ( 43 to 100 percent ) of patients with infectious mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash .
Typically , the rash appears 7 to 10 days after the start of oral ampicillin therapy and remains for a few days to a week after the drug is discontinued .
In most cases , the rash is maculopapular , pruritic , and generalized .
Therefore , the administration of ampicillin is not recommended in patients with mononucleosis .
It is not known whether these patients are truly allergic to ampicillin .
Prescribing ampicillin for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When ampicillin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may : ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment , and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued .
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics , patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic .
If this occurs , patients should contact their physician as soon as possible .
Laboratory Tests As with any potent drug , periodic assessment of organ system function , including renal , hepatic , and hematopoietic , should be made during prolonged therapy .
Transient elevation of serum transaminase has been observed following administration of ampicillin .
The significance of this finding is not known .
Drug Interactions The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of skin rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone .
It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients .
Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions With high urine concentrations of ampicillin , false - positive glucose reactions may occur if Clinitest , Benedict ' s Solution , or Fehling ' s Solution are used .
Therefore , it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions ( such as Clinistix or Tes - Tape ) be used .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Impairment of Fertility No long - term animal studies have been conducted with this drug .
Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in laboratory animals at doses several times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of adverse effects due to ampicillin .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Labor and Delivery Oral ampicillin - class antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor .
Studies in guinea pigs showed that intravenous administration of ampicillin slightly decreased the uterine tone and frequency of contractions , but moderately increased the height and duration of contractions .
However , it is not known whether use of these drugs in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus , prolongs the duration of labor , or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary .
Nursing Mothers Ampicillin is excreted in trace amounts in human milk .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when ampicillin - class antibiotics are administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use Guidelines for the administration of these drugs to children , including neonates are presented in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section .
ADVERSE REACTIONS As with other penicillins , it may be expected that untoward reactions will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena .
They are more likely to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to penicillins and in those with a history of allergy , asthma , hay fever , or urticaria .
The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated with the use of ampicillin : Gastrointestinal Glossitis , stomatitis , black “ hairy ” tongue , nausea , vomiting , enterocolitis , pseudomembranous colitis , and diarrhea .
( These reactions are usually associated with oral dosage forms . )
Hypersensitivity Reactions Skin rashes and urticaria have been reported frequently .
A few cases of exfoliative dermatitis and erythema multiforme have been reported .
Anaphylaxis is the most serious reaction experienced and has usually been associated with the parenteral dosage form .
Note : Urticaria , other skin rashes , and serum sickness - like reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and , if necessary , systemic corticosteroids .
Whenever such reactions occur , ampicillin should be discontinued , unless , in the opinion of the physician , the condition being treated is life - threatening and amenable only to ampicillin therapy .
Serious anaphylactic reactions require the immediate use of epinephrine , oxygen , and intravenous steroids .
Liver – A moderate rise in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) has been noted , particularly in infants , but the significance of this finding is unknown .
Mild transitory SGOT elevations have been observed in individuals receiving larger ( two to four times ) than usual and oft - repeated intramuscular injections .
Evidence indicates that glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( GOT ) is released at the site of intramuscular injection of ampicillin sodium and that the presence of increased amounts of this enzyme in the blood does not necessarily indicate liver involvement .
Hemic and Lymphatic Systems – Anemia , thrombocytopenia , thrombocytopenic purpura , eosinophilia , leukopenia , and agranulocytosis have been reported during therapy with the penicillins .
These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena .
