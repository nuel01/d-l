What are the active ingredients in Gen7T PlusLotion ® ?
The lotion consists of 3 . 5 % lidocaine and 7 % menthol .
INACTIVE INGREDIENTS Phenoxyethanol , Ethylhexylglycerin , Water , Glycerin , Disodium EDTA , Acrylates / C10 - 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer , Caprylic / Capric Triglycerides , Triethanolamine PRESCRIBER INFORMATION Gen7T Plus Lotion ® ( Lidocaine 3 . 5 % / Menthol 7 % ) DESCRIPTION Gen7T PlusLotion ® is a prescription topical lotion containing 120 grams in a bottle .
Lidocaine is present in a 3 . 5 % concentration ( w / w ) .
It is chemically designated as 2 - ( diethylamino ) - N - ( 2 , 6 - dimethylphenyl ) acetamide and has an empirical formula of C14H22N2O .
The molecular weight of lidocaine is 234 . 34 g / mol .
Lidocaine has an octanol : water partition ration of 43 at pH 7 . 4 , and has the following structure : ** Lidocaine ** [ MULTIMEDIA ] Menthol is present in a 7 % concentration ( w / w ) .
The chemical name is ( 1 R , 2 S , 5 R ) 2 isopropyl - 5 - methylcyclohexanol .
The empirical formula for Menthol is C10H20O with a molecular weight of 156 . 27 g / mol .
Menthol contains colorless , hexangonal crystals , usually needle - like ; fused masses or crystalline powder with a pleasant , peppermint - like odor .
It has a melting point between 31 OC to 36 OC and has the following structure : ** Menthol ** [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Lidocaine is a topical anesthetic and stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses , thereby effecting local anesthetic action .
Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities .
It also acts as a weak kappa ( ĸ ) opioid receptor agonist .
Menthol chemically triggers the cold - sensitive TRPM - 8 receptors in the skin , which are responsible for the well - documented cooling sensation that occurs when applied to the skin .
Menthol ’ s analgesic properties are not fully understood ; however , they are mediated through a selective activation of ĸ - opioid receptors .
Menthol also blocks voltage - sensitive sodium channels , reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue .
Menthol works by targeting the kopioid receptor on the TRPM8 neuron .
The TRPM8 neuron is normally activated at temperatures between ( 8 ° - 28 ° C ) .
Menthol causes the neuron to fire at temperatures above normal activation , which triggers the characteristic cooling sensation .
Also because of menthol ' s specific targeting of the kopioid receptor , it is endowed with analgesic properties .
Lidocaine is an amide - type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses .
The penetration of Lidocaine into intact skin after application of patch is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect , but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Gen7T PlusLotion ® is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to lidocaine , or any of the topical amide - like local anesthetic preparations or to any other component of the product .
PRECAUTIONS Because of the possibility of sedation , patients should be cautioned regarding the operation of heavy machinery or automobiles , and any activities made hazardous by decreased alertness .
Hepatic Disease : Patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic blood concentrations of Lidocaine , because of their inability to metabolize Lidocaine normally .
Allergic Reactions : Patients allergic to para - aminobenzoic acid derivatives ( procaine , tetracaine , benzocaine , etc . ) have not shown cross sensitivity to Lidocaine .
However , this product should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities , especially if the etiologic agent is uncertain .
Non - intact Skin : Application to broken or inflamed skin , although not tested , may result in higher blood concentrations of Lidocaine from increased absorption .
Gen7T PlusLotion ® is only recommended for use on intact skin .
Eye Exposure : The contact of this product with the eyes , although not studied , should be avoided based on the findings of severe eye irritations with the use of similar products in animals .
If eye contact occurs , immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns .
External Heat Sources : Placement of external heat sources , such as heating pads or electric blankets , over application area is not recommended as this has not been evaluated and may increase plasma Lidocaine levels .
DRUG INTERACTIONS Antiarrhythmic Drugs : Gen7T PlusLotion ® should be used with caution in patients receiving Class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs ( such as tocainide and mexiletine ) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic .
Local Anesthetics : When Gen7T PlusLotion ® is used concurrently with other products containing local anesthetic agents the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered .
CARCINOGENESIS , MUTAGENESIS , IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY : A minor metabolite , 2 , 6 - xylidine , has been found to be carcinogenic in rats .
The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application topical lidocaine .
The effect of Gen7T PlusLotion ® on fertility has not been studied .
PREGNANCY : The safety of Gen7T PlusLotion ® has not been established during pregnancy .
There are no well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Gen7T PlusLotion ® should not be used during pregnancy unless absolutely needed and discussed with a physician .
NURSING MOTHERS : The effect of Gen7T Plus Lotion ® on the nursing infant has not been evaluated .
Caution should be exercised when Gen7T PlusLotion ® is administered to a nursing mother .
PEDIATRIC / GERIATRIC USE : Safety and effectiveness in pediatric and geriatric patients have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS : The most common adverse reactions are application site reactions , including dermatitis , itching or scaling .
These tend to be dose - limiting and diminish with time .
Serious adverse experiences following the administration of Gen7T Plus Lotion ® are similar in nature to those observed in other amide anesthetic - containing agents .
These adverse experiences are , in general , dose - related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage , rapid absorption , or may result from hypersensitivity , idiosyncrasy , or a diminished tolerance on the part of the patient .
Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature .
OVERDOSAGE : There have been no reports of over - dosage with Gen7T Plus Lotion ® .
