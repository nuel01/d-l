Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % * / 5 % Topical Gel : clindamycin ( 1 % ) * as clindamycin phosphate , benzoyl peroxide ( 5 % ) For Dermatological Use Only – Not for Ophthalmic Use Mix Before Dispensing DESCRIPTION Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % contains clindamycin phosphate , ( 7 ( S ) - chloro - 7 - deoxylincomycin - 2 - phosphate ) .
Clindamycin phosphate is a water soluble ester of the semi - synthetic antibiotic produced by a 7 ( S ) - chloro - substitution of the 7 ( R ) - hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin .
Chemically , clindamycin phosphate is ( C18H34ClN2O8PS ) .
The structural formula for clindamycin is represented below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clindamycin phosphate has a molecular weight of 504 . 97 and its chemical name is Methyl 7 - chloro - 6 , 7 , 8 - trideoxy - 6 - ( 1 - methyl - trans - 4 - propyl - L - 2 - pyrrolidinecarboxamido ) - 1 - thio - L - threo - alpha - D - galacto - octopyranoside 2 - ( dihydrogen phosphate ) .
Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % also contains benzoyl peroxide , for topical use .
Chemically , benzoyl peroxide is ( C14H10O4 ) .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Benzoyl peroxide has a molecular weight of 242 . 23 .
Each gram of Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % contains , as dispensed , 10 mg ( 1 % ) clindamycin as phosphate and 50 mg ( 5 % ) benzoyl peroxide in a base of carbomer , propylene glycol , potassium hydroxide , and purified water .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY An in vitro percutaneous penetration study comparing Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % and topical 1 % clindamycin gel alone , demonstrated there was no statistical difference in penetration between the two drugs .
Mean systemic bioavailability of topical clindamycin in Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % is suggested to be less than 1 % .
Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid .
Less than 2 % of the dose enters systemic circulation as benzoic acid .
It is suggested that the lipophilic nature of benzoyl peroxide acts to concentrate the compound into the lipid - rich sebaceous follicle .
Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics ( plasma and urine ) of clindamycin from Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % was studied in male and female patients ( n = 13 ) with acne vulgaris .
Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % ( ~ 2 g ) was applied topically to the face and back twice daily for four and a half ( 4 . 5 ) days .
Quantifiable ( > LOQ = 1 ng / mL ) clindamycin plasma concentrations were obtained in six of thirteen subjects ( 46 . 2 % ) on Day 1 and twelve of thirteen subjects ( 92 . 3 % ) on Day 5 .
Peak plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) of clindamycin ranged from 1 . 47 ng / mL to 2 . 77 ng / mL on Day 1 and 1 . 43 ng / mL to 7 . 18 ng / mL on Day 5 .
The AUC ( 0 - 12 h ) ranged from 2 . 74 ng . h / mL to 12 . 86 ng . h / mL on Day 1 and 11 . 4 ng . h / mL to 69 . 7 ng . h / mL on Day 5 .
The amount of clindamycin excreted in the urine during the 12 hour dosing interval increased from a mean ( SD ) of 5745 ( 3130 ) ng on Day 1 to 12069 ( 7660 ) ng on Day 5 .
The mean % ( SD ) of the administered dose that was excreted in the urine ranged from 0 . 03 % ( 0 . 02 ) to 0 . 08 % ( 0 . 04 ) .
A comparison of the single ( Day 1 ) and multiple ( Day 5 ) dose plasma urinary concentrations of clindamycin indicates that there is accumulation of clindamycin following multiple dosing of Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % .
The degree of accumulation calculated from the plasma and urinary excretion data was ~ 2 - fold .
Microbiology The clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide components individually have been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris ; however , the clinical significance of this activity against P . acnes was not examined in clinical trials with this product .
CLINICAL STUDIES In two adequate and well controlled clinical studies of 758 patients , 214 used Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % , 210 used benzoyl peroxide , 168 used clindamycin , and 166 used vehicle .
Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % applied twice daily for 10 weeks was significantly more effective than vehicle in the treatment of moderate to moderately severe facial acne vulgaris .
Patients were evaluated and acne lesions counted at each clinical visit ; weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 and 10 .
The primary efficacy measures were the lesion counts and the investigator ’ s global assessment evaluated at week 10 .
Patients were instructed to wash the face with a mild soap , using only the hands .
Fifteen minutes after the face was thoroughly dry , application was made to the entire face .
Non - medicated make - up could be applied at one hour after the Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % application .
If a moisturizer was required , the patients were provided a moisturizer to be used as needed .
Patients were instructed to avoid sun exposure .
Percent reductions in lesion counts after treatment for 10 weeks in these two studies are shown below .
Study 1 Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % n = 120 Benzoyl Peroxide n = 120 Clindamycin n = 120 Vehicle n = 120 Mean percent reduction in inflammatory lesion counts 46 % 32 % 16 % + 3 % Mean percent reduction in non - inflammatory lesion counts 22 % 22 % 9 % + 1 % Mean percent reduction in total lesion counts 36 % 28 % 15 % 0 . 2 % Study 2 Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % n = 95 Benzoyl Peroxide n = 95 Clindamycin n = 49 Vehicle n = 48 Mean percent reduction in inflammatory lesion counts 63 % 53 % 45 % 42 % Mean percent reduction in non - inflammatory lesion counts 54 % 50 % 39 % 36 % Mean percent reduction in total lesion counts 58 % 52 % 42 % 39 % The Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % group showed greater overall improvement than the benzoyl peroxide , clindamycin and vehicle groups as rated by the investigator .

Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be a tumor promoter and progression agent in a number of animal studies .
The clinical significance of this is unknown .
Benzoyl peroxide in acetone at doses of 5 and 10 mg administered twice per week induced skin tumors in transgenic Tg . AC mice in a study using 20 weeks of topical treatment .
In a 52 week dermal photocarcinogenicity study in hairless mice , the median time to onset of skin tumor formation was decreased and the number of tumors per mouse increased following chronic concurrent topical administration of Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % with exposure to ultraviolet radiation ( 40 weeks of treatment followed by 12 weeks of observation ) .
In a 2 - year dermal carcinogenicity study in rats , treatment with Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % at doses of 100 , 500 and 2000 mg / kg / day caused a dose - dependent increase in the incidence of keratoacanthoma at the treated skin site of male rats .
The incidence of keratoacanthoma at the treated site of males treated with 2000 mg / kg / day ( 8 times the highest recommended adult human dose of 2 . 5 g Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % , based on mg / m2 ) was statistically significantly higher than that in the sham - and vehicle - controls .
