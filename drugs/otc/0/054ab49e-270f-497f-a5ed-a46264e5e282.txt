Dosage and Administration , Dosage in Adults ( 2 . 1 ) 08 / 2016 Dosage and Administration , Special Populations ( 2 . 2 ) 12 / 2016 Warnings and Precautions , CNS Depressant Effects and Next - Day Impairment ( 5 . 1 ) 08 / 2016 Warnings and Precautions , Precipitation of Hepatic Encephalopathy ( 5 . 7 ) 12 / 2016 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolpidem tartrate tablets are indicated for the short - term treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep initiation .
Zolpidem tartrate tablets have been shown to decrease sleep latency for up to 35 days in controlled clinical studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The clinical trials performed in support of efficacy were 4 to 5 weeks in duration with the final formal assessments of sleep latency performed at the end of treatment .
Zolpidem tartrate tablets , a gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) A agonist , are indicated for the short - term treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep initiation .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Use the lowest dose effective for the patient and must not exceed a total of 10 mg daily ( 2 . 1 ) • Recommended initial dose is a single dose of 5 mg for women and a single dose of 5 or 10 mg for men , immediately before bedtime with at least 7 to 8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening ( 2 . 1 ) • Geriatric patients and patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment : Recommended dose is 5 mg for men and women ( 2 . 2 ) • Lower doses of CNS depressants may be necessary when taken concomitantly with zolpidem tartrate tablets ( 2 . 3 ) • The effect of zolpidem tartrate tablets may be slowed if taken with or immediately after a meal ( 2 . 4 ) 2 . 1 Dosage in Adults Use the lowest effective dose for the patient .
The recommended initial dose is 5 mg for women and either 5 or 10 mg for men , taken only once per night immediately before bedtime with at least 7 to 8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening .
If the 5 mg dose is not effective , the dose can be increased to 10 mg .
In some patients , the higher morning blood levels following use of the 10 mg dose increase the risk of next day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The total dose of zolpidem tartrate tablets should not exceed 10 mg once daily immediately before bedtime .
Zolpidem tartrate tablets should be taken as a single dose and should not be readministered during the same night .
The recommended initial doses for women and men are different because zolpidem clearance is lower in women .
2 . 2 Special Populations Elderly or debilitated patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of zolpidem tartrate .
The recommended dose of zolpidem tartrate in these patients is 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment do not clear the drug as rapidly as normal subjects .
The recommended dose of zolpidem tartrate in these patients is 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime .
Avoid zolpidem tartrate use in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it may contribute to encephalopathy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 3 Use with CNS Depressants Dosage adjustment may be necessary when zolpidem tartrate tablets are combined with other CNS depressant drugs because of the potentially additive effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 4 Administration The effect of zolpidem tartrate tablets may be slowed by ingestion with or immediately after a meal .

( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Zolpidem tartrate tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to zolpidem .
Observed reactions include anaphylaxis and angioedema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Known hypersensitivity to zolpidem ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • CNS depressant effects : Impairs alertness and motor coordination .
Instruct patients on correct use .
( 5 . 1 ) • Need to evaluate for co - morbid diagnoses : Reevaluate if insomnia persists after 7 to 10 days of use .
( 5 . 2 ) • Severe anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions : Angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported .
Do not rechallenge if such reactions occur .
( 5 . 3 ) • “ Sleep - driving ” and other complex behaviors while not fully awake .
Risk increases with dose and use with other CNS depressants and alcohol .
Immediately evaluate any new onset behavioral changes .
( 5 . 4 ) • Depression : Worsening of depression or suicidal thinking may occur .
Prescribe the least amount of tablets feasible to avoid intentional overdose .
( 5 . 5 ) • Respiratory Depression : Consider this risk before prescribing in patients with compromised respiratory function ( 5 . 6 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Avoid zolpidem tartrate tablets use in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
( 5 . 7 ) • Withdrawal effects : Symptoms may occur with rapid dose reduction or discontinuation .
( 5 . 8 , 9 . 3 ) • Severe Injuries : Drowsiness may lead to fall including severe injuries .
( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 CNS Depressant Effects and Next - Day Impairment Zolpidem tartrate , like other sedative - hypnotic drugs , has central nervous system ( CNS ) depressant effects .
Co - administration with other CNS depressants ( e . g . , benzodiazepines , opioids , tricyclic antidepressants , alcohol ) increases the risk of CNS depression .
Dosage adjustments of zolpidem tartrate and of other concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary when zolpidem tartrate is administered with such agents because of the potentially additive effects .
The use of zolpidem tartrate with other sedative - hypnotics ( including other zolpidem products ) at bedtime or the middle of the night is not recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
The risk of next - day psychomotor impairment , including impaired driving , is increased if zolpidem tartrate is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining ( 7 to 8 hours ) ; if a higher than the recommended dose is taken ; if co - administered with other CNS depressants or alcohol ; or if co - administered with other drugs that increase the blood levels of zolpidem .
Patients should be warned against driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness if zolpidem tartrate is taken in these circumstances [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Vehicle drivers and machine operators should be warned that , as with other hypnotics , there may be a possible risk of adverse reactions including drowsiness , prolonged reaction time , dizziness , sleepiness , blurred / double vision , reduced alertness and impaired driving the morning after therapy .
In order to minimize this risk a full night of sleep ( 7 to 8 hours ) is recommended .
5 . 2 Need to Evaluate for Co - morbid Diagnoses Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and / or psychiatric disorder , symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient .
The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and / or medical illness that should be evaluated .
Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder .
Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative / hypnotic drugs , including zolpidem .
5 . 3 Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions Cases of angioedema involving the tongue , glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative - hypnotics , including zolpidem .
Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea , throat closing or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis .
Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department .
If angioedema involves the throat , glottis or larynx , airway obstruction may occur and be fatal .
Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with zolpidem should not be rechallenged with the drug .
5 . 4 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes Abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported in patients treated with sedative / hypnotics , including zolpidem tartrate .
Some of these changes included decreased inhibition ( e . g . , aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character ) , bizarre behavior , agitation and depersonalization .
Visual and auditory hallucinations have been reported .
In controlled trials of zolpidem tartrate 10 mg taken at bedtime < 1 % of adults with insomnia reported hallucinations .
In a clinical trial , 7 % of pediatric patients treated with zolpidem tartrate 0 . 25 mg / kg taken at bedtime reported hallucinations versus 0 % treated with placebo [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Complex behaviors such as “ sleep - driving ” ( i . e . , driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative - hypnotic , with amnesia for the event ) have been reported in sedative - hypnotic - naive as well as in sedative - hypnotic - experienced persons .
Although behaviors such as “ sleep - driving ” have occurred with zolpidem tartrate alone at therapeutic doses , the co - administration of zolpidem tartrate with alcohol and other CNS depressants increases the risk of such behaviors , as does the use of zolpidem tartrate at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose .
Due to the risk to the patient and the community , discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate should be strongly considered for patients who report a “ sleep - driving ” episode .
Other complex behaviors ( e . g . , preparing and eating food , making phone calls , or having sex ) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative - hypnotic .
As with “ sleep - driving ” , patients usually do not remember these events .
Amnesia , anxiety and other neuro - psychiatric symptoms may also occur .
It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced , spontaneous in origin , or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder .
Nonetheless , the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation .
5 . 5 Use in Patients with Depression In primarily depressed patients treated with sedative - hypnotics , worsening of depression , and suicidal thoughts and actions ( including completed suicides ) , have been reported .
Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required .
Intentional overdosage is more common in this group of patients ; therefore , the lowest number of tablets that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time .
5 . 6 Respiratory Depression Although studies with 10 mg zolpidem tartrate did not reveal respiratory depressant effects at hypnotic doses in healthy subjects or in patients with mild - to - moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , a reduction in the Total Arousal Index , together with a reduction in lowest oxygen saturation and increase in the times of oxygen desaturation below 80 % and 90 % , was observed in patients with mild - to - moderate sleep apnea when treated with zolpidem compared to placebo .
Since sedative - hypnotics have the capacity to depress respiratory drive , precautions should be taken if zolpidem tartrate is prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function .
Post - marketing reports of respiratory insufficiency in patients receiving 10 mg of zolpidem tartrate , most of whom had pre - existing respiratory impairment , have been reported .
The risk of respiratory depression should be considered prior to prescribing zolpidem tartrate in patients with respiratory impairment including sleep apnea and myasthenia gravis .
5 . 7 Precipitation of Hepatic Encephalopathy GABA agonists such as zolpidem tartrate have been associated with precipitation of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with hepatic insufficiency .
In addition , patients with hepatic insufficiency do not clear zolpidem tartrate as rapidly as patients with normal hepatic function .
Avoid zolpidem tartrate use in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it may contribute to encephalopathy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 8 Withdrawal Effects There have been reports of withdrawal signs and symptoms following the rapid dose decrease or abrupt discontinuation of zolpidem .
Monitor patients for tolerance , abuse , and dependence [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 . 2 ) and ( 9 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 9 Severe Injuries Zolpidem can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness , which may lead to falls and consequently to severe injuries .
Severe injuries such as hip fractures and intracranial hemorrhage have been reported .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling : • CNS - depressant effects and next - day impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Serious anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Abnormal thinking and behavior changes , and complex behaviors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Withdrawal effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] Most commonly observed adverse reactions were : Short - term ( < 10 nights ) : Drowsiness , dizziness , and diarrhea Long - term ( 28 to 35 nights ) : Dizziness and drugged feelings ( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Northstar Rx LLC at 1 - 800 - 206 - 7821 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 , or http : / / www . fda . gov / medwatch 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Associated with discontinuation of treatment : Approximately 4 % of 1 , 701 patients who received zolpidem at all doses ( 1 . 25 to 90 mg ) in U . S . premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction .
Reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation from U . S . trials were daytime drowsiness ( 0 . 5 % ) , dizziness ( 0 . 4 % ) , headache ( 0 . 5 % ) , nausea ( 0 . 6 % ) , and vomiting ( 0 . 5 % ) .
Approximately 4 % of 1 , 959 patients who received zolpidem at all doses ( 1 to 50 mg ) in similar foreign trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction .
Reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation from these trials were daytime drowsiness ( 1 . 1 % ) , dizziness / vertigo ( 0 . 8 % ) , amnesia ( 0 . 5 % ) , nausea ( 0 . 5 % ) , headache ( 0 . 4 % ) , and falls ( 0 . 4 % ) .
Data from a clinical study in which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) - treated patients were given zolpidem revealed that four of the seven discontinuations during double - blind treatment with zolpidem ( n = 95 ) were associated with impaired concentration , continuing or aggravated depression , and manic reaction ; one patient treated with placebo ( n = 97 ) was discontinued after an attempted suicide .
Most commonly observed adverse reactions in controlled trials : During short - term treatment ( up to 10 nights ) with zolpidem tartrate at doses up to 10 mg , the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of zolpidem and seen at statistically significant differences from placebo - treated patients were drowsiness ( reported by 2 % of zolpidem patients ) , dizziness ( 1 % ) , and diarrhea ( 1 % ) .
During longer - term treatment ( 28 to 35 nights ) with zolpidem at doses up to 10 mg , the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of zolpidem and seen at statistically significant differences from placebo - treated patients were dizziness ( 5 % ) and drugged feelings ( 3 % ) .
Adverse reactions observed at an incidence of ≥ 1 % in controlled trials : The following tables enumerate treatment - emergent adverse reactions frequencies that were observed at an incidence equal to 1 % or greater among patients with insomnia who received zolpidem tartrate and at a greater incidence than placebo in U . S . placebo - controlled trials .
Events reported by investigators were classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization ( WHO ) dictionary of preferred terms for the purpose of establishing event frequencies .
The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice , in which patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in these clinical trials .
Similarly , the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving related drug products and uses , since each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions .
However , the cited figures provide the physician with a basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the incidence of side effects in the population studied .
The following table was derived from results of 11 placebo - controlled short - term U . S . efficacy trials involving zolpidem in doses ranging from 1 . 25 to 20 mg .
The table is limited to data from doses up to and including 10 mg , the highest dose recommended for use .
Incidence of Treatment - Emergent Adverse Experiences in Placebo - Controlled Clinical Trials Lasting up to 10 Nights ( Percentage of patients reporting ) * Reactions reported by at least 1 % of patients treated with zolpidem tartrate and at a greater frequency than placebo .
Body System / Adverse Event * Zolpidem ( ≤ 10 mg ) ( N = 685 ) Placebo ( N = 473 ) Central and Peripheral Nervous System Headache 7 6 Drowsiness 2 - Dizziness 1 - Gastrointestinal System Diarrhea 1 - The following table was derived from results of three placebo - controlled long - term efficacy trials involving zolpidem tartrate .
These trials involved patients with chronic insomnia who were treated for 28 to 35 nights with zolpidem at doses of 5 , 10 , or 15 mg .
The table is limited to data from doses up to and including 10 mg , the highest dose recommended for use .
The table includes only adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 1 % for zolpidem patients .
Incidence of Treatment - Emergent Adverse Experiences in Placebo - Controlled Clinical Trials Lasting up to 35 Nights ( Percentage of patients reporting ) * Reactions reported by at least 1 % of patients treated with zolpidem tartrate and at a greater frequency than placebo .

Adverse event incidence across the entire preapproval database : Zolpidem tartrate was administered to 3 , 660 subjects in clinical trials throughout the U . S . , Canada , and Europe .
Treatment - emergent adverse events associated with clinical trial participation were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing .
To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing treatment - emergent adverse events , similar types of untoward events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized event categories and classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization ( WHO ) dictionary of preferred terms .
The frequencies presented , therefore , represent the proportions of the 3 , 660 individuals exposed to zolpidem , at all doses , who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving zolpidem .
All reported treatment - emergent adverse events are included , except those already listed in the table above of adverse events in placebo - controlled studies , those coding terms that are so general as to be uninformative , and those events where a drug cause was remote .
It is important to emphasize that , although the events reported did occur during treatment with zolpidem tartrate , they were not necessarily caused by it .
Adverse events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions : frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in greater than 1 / 100 subjects ; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1 / 100 to 1 / 1 , 000 patients ; rare events are those occurring in less than 1 / 1 , 000 patients .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of zolpidem tartrate .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Liver and biliary system : acute hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury with or without jaundice ( i . e . , bilirubin > 2 x ULN , alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2 x ULN , transaminase ≥ 5 x ULN ) .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • CNS depressants , including alcohol : Possible adverse additive CNS - depressant effects ( 5 . 1 , 7 . 1 ) • Imipramine : Decreased alertness observed ( 7 . 1 ) • Chlorpromazine : Impaired alertness and psychomotor performance observed ( 7 . 1 ) • CYP3A4 inducers ( rifampin or St . John " s wort ) : Combination use may decrease effect ( 7 . 2 ) • Ketoconazole ) : Combination use may increase effect ( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 CNS - active Drugs Co - administration of zolpidem with other CNS depressants increases the risk of CNS depression .
Concomitant use of zolpidem with these drugs may increase drowsiness and psychomotor impairment , including impaired driving ability .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Zolpidem tartrate was evaluated in healthy volunteers in single - dose interaction studies for several CNS drugs .
Imipramine , Chlorpromazine Imipramine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20 % decrease in peak levels of imipramine , but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness .
Similarly , chlorpromazine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction , but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Haloperidol A study involving haloperidol and zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem .
The lack of a drug interaction following single - dose administration does not predict the absence of an effect following chronic administration [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Alcohol An additive adverse effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and oral zolpidem was demonstrated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Sertraline Concomitant administration of zolpidem and sertraline increases exposure to zolpidem [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Fluoxetine After multiple doses of zolpidem tartrate and fluoxetine an increase in the zolpidem half - life ( 17 % ) was observed .
There was no evidence of an additive effect in psychomotor performance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Drugs that Affect Drug Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 Some compounds known to induce or inhibit CYP3A may affect exposure to zolpidem .
The effect of drugs that induce or inhibit other P450 enzymes on the exposure to zolpidem is not known .
CYP3A4 Inducers Rifampin Rifampin , a CYP3A4 inducer , significantly reduced the exposure to and the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem .
Use of Rifampin in combination with zolpidem may decrease the efficacy of zolpidem and is not recommended [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
St . John ' s wort Use of St . John ' s wort , a CYP3A4 inducer , in combination with zolpidem may decrease blood levels of zolpidem and is not recommended .
CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole Ketoconazole , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor , increased the exposure to and pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem .
Consideration should be given to using a lower dose of zolpidem when a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and zolpidem are given together [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm ( 8 . 1 ) • Pediatric use : Safety and effectiveness not established .
Hallucinations ( incidence rate 7 % ) and other psychiatric and / or nervous system adverse reactions were observed frequently in a study of pediatric patients with Attention - Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( 5 . 4 , 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of zolpidem tartrate in pregnant women .
Studies in children to assess the effects of prenatal exposure to zolpidem have not been conducted ; however , cases of severe neonatal respiratory depression have been reported when zolpidem was used at the end of pregnancy , especially when taken with other CNS - depressants .
Children born to mothers taking sedative - hypnotic drugs may be at risk for withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period .
Neonatal flaccidity has also been reported in infants born to mothers who received sedative - hypnotic drugs during pregnancy .
Zolpidem tartrate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus .
Administration of zolpidem to pregnant rats and rabbits resulted in adverse effects on offspring development at doses greater than the zolpidem tartrate maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 10 mg / day ( approximately 8 mg / day zolpidem base ) ; however , teratogenicity was not observed .
When zolpidem was administered at oral doses of 4 , 20 , and 100 mg base / kg / day to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis , dose - related decreases in fetal skull ossification occurred at all but the lowest dose , which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis .
In rabbits treated during organogenesis with zolpidem at oral doses of 1 , 4 , and 16 mg base / kg / day increased embryo - fetal death and incomplete fetal skeletal ossification occurred at the highest dose tested .
The no - effect dose for embryo - fetal toxicity in rabbits is approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis .
Administration of zolpidem to rats at oral doses of 4 , 20 , and 100 mg base / kg / day during the latter part of pregnancy and throughout lactation produced decreased offspring growth and survival at all but the lowest dose , which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis .
8 . 2 Labor and Delivery Zolpidem tartrate has no established use in labor and delivery [ see Pregnancy ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Zolpidem is excreted in human milk .
Caution should be exercised when zolpidem tartrate is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Zolpidem tartrate is not recommended for use in children .
Safety and effectiveness of zolpidem in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established .
In an 8 - week study , in pediatric patients ( aged 6 to 17 years ) with insomnia associated with attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) an oral solution of zolpidem tartrate dosed at 0 . 25 mg / kg at bedtime did not decrease sleep latency compared to placebo .
Psychiatric and nervous system disorders comprised the most frequent ( > 5 % ) treatment emergent adverse reactions observed with zolpidem versus placebo and included dizziness ( 23 . 5 % vs . 1 . 5 % ) , headache ( 12 . 5 % vs . 9 . 2 % ) , and hallucinations were reported in 7 % of the pediatric patients who received zolpidem ; none of the pediatric patients who received placebo reported hallucinations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Ten patients on zolpidem ( 7 . 4 % ) discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use A total of 154 patients in U . S . controlled clinical trials and 897 patients in non - U . S . clinical trials who received zolpidem were ≥ 60 years of age .
For a pool of U . S . patients receiving zolpidem at doses of ≤ 10 mg or placebo , there were three adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of at least 3 % for zolpidem and for which the zolpidem incidence was at least twice the placebo incidence ( i . e . , they could be considered drug related ) .
Adverse Event Zolpidem Placebo Dizziness 3 % 0 % Drowsiness 5 % 2 % Diarrhea 3 % 1 % A total of 30 / 1 , 959 ( 1 . 5 % ) non - U . S . patients receiving zolpidem reported falls , including 28 / 30 ( 93 % ) who were ≥ 70 years of age .
Of these 28 patients , 23 ( 82 % ) were receiving zolpidem doses > 10 mg .
A total of 24 / 1 , 959 ( 1 . 2 % ) non - U . S . patients receiving zolpidem reported confusion , including 18 / 24 ( 75 % ) who were ≥ 70 years of age .
Of these 18 patients , 14 ( 78 % ) were receiving zolpidem doses > 10 mg .
The dose of zolpidem tartrate in elderly patients is 5 mg to minimize adverse effects related to impaired motor and / or cognitive performance and unusual sensitivity to sedative / hypnotic drugs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 6 Gender Difference in Pharmacokinetics Women clear zolpidem tartrate from the body at a lower rate than men .
Cmax and AUC parameters of zolpidem were approximately 45 % higher at the same dose in female subjects compared with male subjects .
Given the higher blood levels of zolpidem tartrate in women compared to men at a given dose , the recommended initial dose of zolpidem tartrate for adult women is 5 mg , and the recommended dose for adult men is 5 or 10 mg .
In geriatric patients , clearance of zolpidem is similar in men and women .
The recommended dose of zolpidem tartrate in geriatric patients is 5 mg regardless of gender .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolpidem tartrate in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment is 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime .
Avoid zolpidem tartrate use in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it may contribute to encephalopathy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance Zolpidem tartrate is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by federal regulation .
9 . 2 Abuse Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance .
Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non - medical purposes , often in combination with other psychoactive substances .
Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug effects over time .
Tolerance may occur to both desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects .
Addiction is a primary , chronic , neurobiological disease with genetic , psychosocial , and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations .
It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following : impaired control over drug use , compulsive use , continued use despite harm , and craving .
Drug addiction is a treatable disease , using a multidisciplinary approach , but relapse is common .
Studies of abuse potential in former drug abusers found that the effects of single doses of zolpidem tartrate 40 mg were similar , but not identical , to diazepam 20 mg , while zolpidem tartrate 10 mg was difficult to distinguish from placebo .
Because persons with a history of addiction to , or abuse of , drugs or alcohol are at increased risk for misuse , abuse and addiction of zolpidem , they should be monitored carefully when receiving zolpidem or any other hypnotic .
9 . 3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation , rapid dose reduction , decreasing blood level of the drug , and / or administration of an antagonist .
Sedative / hypnotics have produced withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation .
These reported symptoms range from mild dysphoria and insomnia to a withdrawal syndrome that may include abdominal and muscle cramps , vomiting , sweating , tremors , and convulsions .
The following adverse events which are considered to meet the DSM - III - R criteria for uncomplicated sedative / hypnotic withdrawal were reported during U . S . clinical trials following placebo substitution occurring within 48 hours following last zolpidem treatment : fatigue , nausea , flushing , lightheadedness , uncontrolled crying , emesis , stomach cramps , panic attack , nervousness , and abdominal discomfort .
These reported adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1 % or less .
However , available data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence , if any , of dependence during treatment at recommended doses .
Post - marketing reports of abuse , dependence and withdrawal have been received .
10 OVERDOSAGE 10 . 1 Signs and Symptoms In postmarketing experience of overdose with zolpidem tartrate alone , or in combination with CNS - depressant agents , impairment of consciousness ranging from somnolence to coma , cardiovascular and / or respiratory compromise , and fatal outcomes have been reported .
10 . 2 Recommended Treatment General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate .
Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed .
Zolpidem ’ s sedative hypnotic effect was shown to be reduced by flumazenil and therefore may be useful ; however , flumazenil administration may contribute to the appearance of neurological symptoms ( convulsions ) .
As in all cases of drug overdose , respiration , pulse , blood pressure , and other appropriate signs should be monitored and general supportive measures employed .
Hypotension and CNS depression should be monitored and treated by appropriate medical intervention .
Sedating drugs should be withheld following zolpidem overdosage , even if excitation occurs .
The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage has not been determined , although hemodialysis studies in patients with renal failure receiving therapeutic doses have demonstrated that zolpidem is not dialyzable .
As with the management of all overdosage , the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered .
The physician may wish to consider contacting a poison control center for up - to - date information on the management of hypnotic drug product overdosage .
11 DESCRIPTION Zolpidem tartrate USP is a gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) A agonist of the imidazopyridine class and is available in 5 mg and 10 mg strength tablets for oral administration .
Chemically , zolpidem is N , N , 6 - trimethyl - 2 - p - tolylimidazo [ 1 , 2 - a ] pyridine - 3 - acetamide L - ( + ) - tartrate ( 2 : 1 ) .
It has the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Zolpidem tartrate USP is a white to off - white crystalline powder that is sparingly soluble in water , alcohol , and propylene glycol .
It has a molecular weight of 764 . 88 .
Each zolpidem tartrate tablet , USP includes the following inactive ingredients : lactose monohydrate , microcrystalline cellulose , sodium starch glycolate , magnesium stearate , hypromellose , polyethylene glycol , and titanium dioxide .
Meets USP Dissolution Test - 3 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Zolpidem , the active moiety of zolpidem tartrate , is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines , barbiturates , or other drugs with known hypnotic properties .
It interacts with a GABA - BZ receptor complex and shares some of the pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepines .
In contrast to the benzodiazepines , which non - selectively bind to and activate all BZ receptor subtypes , zolpidem in vitro binds the BZ1 receptor preferentially with a high affinity ratio of the α1 / α5 subunits .
This selective binding of zolpidem on the BZ1 receptor is not absolute , but it may explain the relative absence of myorelaxant and anticonvulsant effects in animal studies as well as the preservation of deep sleep ( stages 3 and 4 ) in human studies of zolpidem tartrate at hypnotic doses .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic profile of zolpidem tartrate is characterized by rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and a short elimination half - life ( T1 / 2 ) in healthy subjects .
In a single - dose crossover study in 45 healthy subjects administered 5 and 10 mg zolpidem tartrate tablets , the mean peak concentrations ( Cmax ) were 59 ( range : 29 to 113 ) and 121 ( range : 58 to 272 ) ng / mL , respectively , occurring at a mean time ( Tmax ) of 1 . 6 hours for both .
The mean zolpidem tartrate elimination half - life was 2 . 6 ( range : 1 . 4 to 4 . 5 ) and 2 . 5 ( range : 1 . 4 to 3 . 8 ) hours , for the 5 and 10 mg tablets , respectively .
Zolpidem tartrate is converted to inactive metabolites that are eliminated primarily by renal excretion .
Zolpidem tartrate demonstrated linear kinetics in the dose range of 5 to 20 mg .
Total protein binding was found to be 92 . 5 ± 0 . 1 % and remained constant , independent of concentration between 40 and 790 ng / mL .
Zolpidem did not accumulate in young adults following nightly dosing with 20 mg zolpidem tartrate tablets for 2 weeks .
A food - effect study in 30 healthy male subjects compared the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem tartrate 10 mg when administered while fasting or 20 minutes after a meal .
Results demonstrated that with food , mean AUC and Cmax were decreased by 15 % and 25 % , respectively , while mean Tmax was prolonged by 60 % ( from 1 . 4 to 2 . 2 hr ) .
The half - life remained unchanged .
These results suggest that , for faster sleep onset , zolpidem tartrate should not be administered with or immediately after a meal .
Special Populations Elderly : In the elderly , the dose for zolpidem tartrate should be 5 mg [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
This recommendation is based on several studies in which the mean Cmax , T1 / 2 , and AUC were significantly increased when compared to results in young adults .
In one study of eight elderly subjects ( > 70 years ) , the means for Cmax , T1 / 2 , and AUC significantly increased by 50 % ( 255 vs . 384 ng / mL ) , 32 % ( 2 . 2 vs . 2 . 9 hr ) , and 64 % ( 955 vs . 1 , 562 ng • hr / mL ) , respectively , as compared to younger adults ( 20 to 40 years ) following a single 20 mg oral dose .
Zolpidem tartrate did not accumulate in elderly subjects following nightly oral dosing of 10 mg for 1 week .
Hepatic Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of zolpidem tartrate in eight patients with chronic hepatic insufficiency were compared to results in healthy subjects .
Following a single 20 mg oral zolpidem tartrate dose , mean Cmax and AUC were found to be two times ( 250 vs . 499 ng / mL ) and five times ( 788 vs . 4 , 203 ng • hr / mL ) higher , respectively , in hepatically - compromised patients .
Tmax did not change .
The mean half - life in cirrhotic patients of 9 . 9 hr ( range : 4 . 1 to 25 . 8 hr ) was greater than that observed in normal subjects of 2 . 2 hr ( range : 1 . 6 to 2 . 4 hr ) .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Renal Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of zolpidem tartrate were studied in 11 patients with end - stage renal failure ( mean ClCr = 6 . 5 ± 1 . 5 mL / min ) undergoing hemodialysis three times a week , who were dosed with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg orally each day for 14 or 21 days .
No statistically significant differences were observed for Cmax , Tmax , half - life , and AUC between the first and last day of drug administration when baseline concentration adjustments were made .
Zolpidem was not hemodialyzable .
No accumulation of unchanged drug appeared after 14 or 21 days .
Zolpidem pharmacokinetics were not significantly different in renally impaired patients .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with compromised renal function .
Drug Interactions CNS - depressants Co - administration of zolpidem with other CNS depressants increases the risk of CNS depression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Zolpidem tartrate was evaluated in healthy volunteers in single - dose interaction studies for several CNS drugs .
Imipramine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20 % decrease in peak levels of imipramine , but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness .
Similarly , chlorpromazine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction , but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance .
A study involving haloperidol and zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem .
The lack of a drug interaction following single - dose administration does not predict the absence of an effect following chronic administration .
An additive adverse effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and oral zolpidem was demonstrated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Following five consecutive nightly doses at bedtime of oral zolpidem tartrate 10 mg in the presence of sertraline 50 mg ( 17 consecutive daily doses , at 7 : 00 am , in healthy female volunteers ) , zolpidem Cmax was significantly higher ( 43 % ) and Tmax was significantly decreased ( - 53 % ) .
Pharmacokinetics of sertraline and N - desmethylsertraline were unaffected by zolpidem .
A single - dose interaction study with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg and fluoxetine 20 mg at steady - state levels in male volunteers did not demonstrate any clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions .
When multiple doses of zolpidem and fluoxetine were given at steady state and the concentrations evaluated in healthy females , an increase in the zolpidem half - life ( 17 % ) was observed .
There was no evidence of an additive effect in psychomotor performance .
Drugs that Affect Drug Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 Some compounds known to inhibit CYP3A may increase exposure to zolpidem .
The effect of inhibitors of other P450 enzymes on the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem is unknown .
A single - dose interaction study with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg and itraconazole 200 mg at steady - state levels in male volunteers resulted in a 34 % increase in AUC0 - ∞ of zolpidem tartrate .
There were no pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem detected on subjective drowsiness , postural sway , or psychomotor performance .
A single - dose interaction study with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg and rifampin 600 mg at steady - state levels in female subjects showed significant reductions of the AUC ( - 73 % ) , Cmax ( - 58 % ) , and T1 / 2 ( - 36 % ) of zolpidem together with significant reductions in the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem tartrate .
Rifampin , a CYP3A4 inducer , significantly reduced the exposure to and the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Similarly , St . John ' s Wort , a CYP3A4 inducer , may also decrease the blood levels of zolpidem .
A single - dose interaction study with zolpidem tartrate 5 mg and ketoconazole , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor , given as 200 mg twice daily for 2 days increased Cmax of zolpidem ( 30 % ) and the total AUC of zolpidem ( 70 % ) compared to zolpidem alone and prolonged the elimination half - life ( 30 % ) along with an increase in the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Additionally , fluvoxamine ( a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 ) and ciprofloxacin ( a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 ) are also likely to inhibit zolpidem ’ s metabolic pathways , potentially leading to an increase in zolpidem exposure .
Other Drugs with No Interactions with Zolpidem A study involving cimetidine / zolpidem tartrate and ranitidine / zolpidem tartrate combinations revealed no effect of either drug on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem .
Zolpidem tartrate had no effect on digoxin pharmacokinetics and did not affect prothrombin time when given with warfarin in healthy subjects .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis : Zolpidem was administered to mice and rats for 2 years at oral doses of 4 , 18 , and 80 mg base / kg .
In mice , these doses are approximately 2 . 5 , 10 , and 50 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 10 mg / day ( 8 mg zolpidem base ) on mg / m2 basis .
In rats , these doses are approximately 5 , 20 , and 100 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis .
No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in mice .
In rats , renal tumors ( lipoma , liposarcoma ) were seen at the mid - and high doses .
Mutagenesis : Zolpidem was negative in in vitro ( bacterial reverse mutation , mouse lymphoma , and chromosomal aberration ) and in vivo ( mouse micronucleus ) genetic toxicology assays .
Impairment of fertility : Oral administration of zolpidem ( doses of 4 , 20 , and 100 mg base / kg / day ) to rats prior to and during mating , and continuing in females through postpartum day 25 , resulted in irregular estrus cycles and prolonged precoital intervals at the highest dose tested .
The no - effect dose for these findings is approximately 24 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis .
There was no impairment of fertility at any dose tested .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Transient Insomnia Normal adults experiencing transient insomnia ( n = 462 ) during the first night in a sleep laboratory were evaluated in a double - blind , parallel group , single - night trial comparing two doses of zolpidem ( 7 . 5 and 10 mg ) and placebo .
Both zolpidem doses were superior to placebo on objective ( polysomnographic ) measures of sleep latency , sleep duration , and number of awakenings .
Normal elderly adults ( mean age 68 ) experiencing transient insomnia ( n = 35 ) during the first two nights in a sleep laboratory were evaluated in a double - blind , crossover , 2 - night trial comparing four doses of zolpidem ( 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 mg ) and placebo .
All zolpidem doses were superior to placebo on the two primary PSG parameters ( sleep latency and efficiency ) and all four subjective outcome measures ( sleep duration , sleep latency , number of awakenings , and sleep quality ) .
14 . 2 Chronic Insomnia Zolpidem was evaluated in two controlled studies for the treatment of patients with chronic insomnia ( most closely resembling primary insomnia , as defined in the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , DSM - IV ™ ) .
Adult outpatients with chronic insomnia ( n = 75 ) were evaluated in a double - blind , parallel group , 5 - week trial comparing two doses of zolpidem tartrate and placebo .
On objective ( polysomnographic ) measures of sleep latency and sleep efficiency , zolpidem 10 mg was superior to placebo on sleep latency for the first 4 weeks and on sleep efficiency for weeks 2 and 4 .
Zolpidem was comparable to placebo on number of awakenings at both doses studied .
Adult outpatients ( n = 141 ) with chronic insomnia were also evaluated , in a double - blind , parallel group , 4 - week trial comparing two doses of zolpidem and placebo .
Zolpidem 10 mg was superior to placebo on a subjective measure of sleep latency for all 4 weeks , and on subjective measures of total sleep time , number of awakenings , and sleep quality for the first treatment week .
Increased wakefulness during the last third of the night as measured by polysomnography has not been observed in clinical trials with zolpidem tartrate .
14 . 3 Studies Pertinent to Safety Concerns for Sedative / Hypnotic Drugs Next - day residual effects : Next - day residual effects of zolpidem tartrate were evaluated in seven studies involving normal subjects .
In three studies in adults ( including one study in a phase advance model of transient insomnia ) and in one study in elderly subjects , a small but statistically significant decrease in performance was observed in the Digit Symbol Substitution Test ( DSST ) when compared to placebo .
Studies of zolpidem tartrate in non - elderly patients with insomnia did not detect evidence of next - day residual effects using the DSST , the Multiple Sleep Latency Test ( MSLT ) , and patient ratings of alertness .
Rebound effects : There was no objective ( polysomnographic ) evidence of rebound insomnia at recommended doses seen in studies evaluating sleep on the nights following discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate .
There was subjective evidence of impaired sleep in the elderly on the first post - treatment night at doses above the recommended elderly dose of 5 mg .
Memory impairment : Controlled studies in adults utilizing objective measures of memory yielded no consistent evidence of next - day memory impairment following the administration of zolpidem tartrate .
However , in one study involving zolpidem doses of 10 and 20 mg , there was a significant decrease in next - morning recall of information presented to subjects during peak drug effect ( 90 minutes post - dose ) , i . e . , these subjects experienced anterograde amnesia .
There was also subjective evidence from adverse event data for anterograde amnesia occurring in association with the administration of zolpidem tartrate , predominantly at doses above 10 mg .
Effects on sleep stages : In studies that measured the percentage of sleep time spent in each sleep stage , zolpidem tartrate has generally been shown to preserve sleep stages .
Sleep time spent in stages 3 and 4 ( deep sleep ) was found comparable to placebo with only inconsistent , minor changes in REM ( paradoxical ) sleep at the recommended dose .
