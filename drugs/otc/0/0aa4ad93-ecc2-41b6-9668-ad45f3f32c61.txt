8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , XPOVIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug - associated risk .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of selinexor to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in structural abnormalities and alterations to growth at exposures that were below those occurring clinically at the recommended dose ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the risks to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal data In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rats , daily oral administration of selinexor at 0 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 75 , or 2 mg / kg throughout organogenesis caused incomplete or delayed ossification , skeletal variations , and reduced fetal weight compared with controls at a dose of 0 . 75 mg / kg ( approximately 0 . 08 - fold of human area under the curve [ AUC ] at the recommended dose ) .
Malformations were observed at 2 mg / kg , including microphthalmia , fetal edema , malpositioned kidney , and persistent truncus arteriosus .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of selinexor or its metabolites in human milk , or their effects on the breastfed child or milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with XPOVIO and for 1 week after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential XPOVIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating XPOVIO [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XPOVIO and for 1 week after the last dose .
Males Advise males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XPOVIO and for 1 week after the last dose .
Infertility Females and Males Based on findings in animals , XPOVIO may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of XPOVIO have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In BOSTON , of the 195 patients with multiple myeloma who received XPOVIO in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone , 56 % were 65 years of age and older , while 17 % were 75 years of age and older .
No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
When comparing patients 65 years of age and older to younger patients , older patients had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to an adverse reaction ( 28 % vs 13 % ) and a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions ( 56 % vs 47 % ) .
In STORM , of the 202 patients with multiple myeloma who received XPOVIO , 49 % were 65 years of age and older , while 11 % were 75 years of age and older .
No overall difference in effectiveness was observed in patients over 65 years of age , including patients over 75 years of age , when compared with younger patients .
When comparing patients 75 years of age and older to younger patients , older patients had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to an adverse reaction ( 44 % vs 27 % ) , higher incidence of serious adverse reactions ( 70 % vs 58 % ) , and higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions ( 17 % vs 9 % ) .
Among 134 patients with DLBCL who received XPOVIO in SADAL , 61 % were 65 years of age and older , while 25 % were 75 years of age and older .
Clinical studies of XPOVIO in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION Selinexor is a nuclear export inhibitor .
Selinexor is ( 2 Z ) - 3 - { 3 - [ 3 , 5 - bis ( trifluoromethyl ) phenyl ] - 1 H - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazol - 1 yl } - N ' - ( pyrazin - 2 - yl ) prop - 2 - enehydrazide .
It is a white to off - white powder and has the molecular formula C17H11F6N7O and a molecular mass of 443 . 31 g / mol .
The molecular structure is shown below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] XPOVIO tablets for oral dosing are supplied in four strengths , with each tablet containing 20 mg , 40 mg , 50 mg , or 60 mg of selinexor as the active ingredient .
The inactive ingredients are colloidal silicon dioxide , croscarmellose sodium , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , Opadry 200 clear , Opadry II blue , povidone K30 , and sodium lauryl sulfate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action In nonclinical studies , selinexor reversibly inhibits nuclear export of tumor suppressor proteins ( TSPs ) , growth regulators , and mRNAs of oncogenic proteins by blocking exportin 1 ( XPO1 ) .
XPO1 inhibition by selinexor leads to accumulation of TSPs in the nucleus and reductions in several oncoproteins , such as c - myc and cyclin D1 , cell cycle arrest , and apoptosis of cancer cells .
Selinexor demonstrated pro - apoptotic activity in vitro in multiple myeloma cells and showed anti - tumor activity in murine xenograft models of multiple myeloma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma .
The combination of selinexor and dexamethasone or bortezomib demonstrated synergistic cytotoxic effects in multiple myeloma in vitro and increased anti - tumor activity in murine xenograft multiple myeloma models in vivo , including those resistant to proteasome inhibitors .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics An increase in selinexor exposure was associated with an increase in the probability of dose modification and some adverse reactions .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of multiple doses of XPOVIO , up to 175 mg per dose ( 1 . 75 times the maximum approved recommended dose ) , on the QTc interval was evaluated in patients with heavily pretreated hematologic malignancies .
XPOVIO had no large effect ( i . e . no greater than 20 ms ) on QTc interval at the therapeutic dose level .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Selinexor Cmax and AUC increased proportionally over a dose range from 3 mg / m2 to 85 mg / m2 ( 0 . 05 to 1 . 44 ) times the maximum approved recommended dose , based on 1 . 7 m2 body surface area .
No clinically relevant accumulation at steady state was observed .
Selinexor Cmax and AUC0 - INF after administration of a single dose of XPOVIO in patients with hematologic malignancies are presented in Table 10 .
Table 10 : Selinexor Cmax and AUC After Administration of a Single Dose of XPOVIO Mean ( XD ) XPOVIO Dose 60 mg 80 mg 100 mg Cmax ( ng / mL ) 442 ( 188 ) 680 ( 124 ) 693 ( 201 ) AUC0 - INF ( ng · h / mL ) 4 , 096 ( 1 , 185 ) 5 , 386 ( 1 , 116 ) 6 , 998 ( 818 ) Absorption The Cmax is reached within 4 hours following oral administration of XPOVIO .
Effect of Food Concomitant administration of a high - fat meal ( 800 to 1 , 000 calories with approximately 50 % of total caloric content of the meal from fat ) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of selinexor to a clinically significant extent .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of selinexor is 133 L in patients with cancer .
The protein binding of selinexor is 95 % .
Elimination Following a single dose of XPOVIO , the mean half - life is 6 to 8 hours .
The apparent total clearance of selinexor is 18 . 6 L / h in patients with cancer .
Metabolism Selinexor is metabolized by CYP3A4 , multiple UDP - glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs ) and glutathione Stransferases ( GSTs ) .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of selinexor were observed based on age ( 18 to 94 years old ) , sex , body weight ( 36 to 168 kg ) , ethnicity , mild to severe renal impairment ( CLCR : 15 to 89 mL / min , estimated by the Cockcroft - Gault equation ) , and disease type ( hematological non - DLBCL , solid tumor , DLBCL ) .
The effect of end - stage renal disease ( CLCR < 15 mL / min ) or hemodialysis on selinexor pharmacokinetics is unknown .
Mild hepatic impairment had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of selinexor .
The effect of moderate and severe hepatic impairment on selinexor pharmacokinetics is unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Acetaminophen : No clinically significant differences in selinexor pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with acetaminophen ( up to 1 , 000 mg daily dose of acetaminophen ) .
Clarithromycin ( a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ) : No clinically significant differences in selinexor pharmacokinetics were observed when co - administered with clarithromycin ( up to 1 , 000 mg daily dose of clarithromycin ) .
In vitro Studies CYP Enzymes : Selinexor does not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP3A4 / 5 .
Selinexor is not a CYP3A4 , CYP1A2 , or CYP2B6 inducer .
Non - CYP Enzyme Systems : Selinexor is a substrate of UGTs and GSTs .
Transporter Systems : Selinexor inhibits OATP1B3 but does not inhibit other solute carrier ( SLC ) transporters .
Selinexor is not a substrate of P - gp , BCRP , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OAT1 , OAT3 , OCT1 , OCT2 , MATE1 , or MATE2 - K .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with selinexor .
Selinexor was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay and was not clastogenic in either the in vitro cytogenetic assay in human lymphocytes or in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay .
Fertility studies in animals have not been conducted with selinexor .
In repeat - dose oral toxicity studies , selinexor was administered for up to 13 weeks in rats and monkeys .
Reduced sperm , spermatids , and germ cells in epididymides and testes were observed in rats at ≥ 1 mg / kg , decreased ovarian follicles were observed in rats at ≥ 2 mg / kg , and single cell necrosis of testes was observed in monkeys at ≥ 1 . 5 mg / kg .
These dose levels resulted in systemic exposures approximately 0 . 11 , 0 . 28 , and 0 . 53 times , respectively , the exposure ( AUClast ) in humans at the recommended human dose of 80 mg .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma XPOVIO Combination with Bortezomib and Dexamethasone ( XVd ) The efficacy of XPOVIO in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone was evaluated in BOSTON ( NCT03110562 ) .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] XPOVIO Combination with Dexamethasone ( Xd ) The efficacy of XPOVIO plus dexamethasone was evaluated in STORM ( KCP - 330 - 012 ; NCT02336815 ) .
STORM was a multicenter , single - arm , open - label study of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma ( RRMM ) .
STORM Part 2 included 122 patients with RRMM who had previously received three or more antimyeloma treatment regimens including an alkylating agent , glucocorticoids , bortezomib , carfilzomib , lenalidomide , pomalidomide , and an anti - CD38 monoclonal antibody ; and whose myeloma was documented to be refractory to glucocorticoids , a proteasome inhibitor , an immunomodulatory agent , an anti - CD38 monoclonal antibody , and to the last line of therapy .
In STORM Part 2 , a total of 122 patients received XPOVIO 80 mg orally in combination with dexamethasone 20 mg orally on Days 1 and 3 of every week .
Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Eighty - three patients had RRMM that was refractory to bortezomib , carfilzomib , lenalidomide , pomalidomide , and daratumumab .
Baseline patient demographics and disease characteristics of these 83 patients are summarized in Table 14 and Table 15 , respectively .
Efficacy was based on overall response rate ( ORR ) , as assessed by an Independent Review Committee ( IRC ) based on the International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma .
The approval of XPOVIO was based upon the efficacy and safety in a prespecified subgroup analysis of the 83 patients whose disease was refractory to bortezomib , carfilzomib , lenalidomide , pomalidomide , and daratumumab , as the benefit - risk ratio appeared to be greater in this more heavily pretreated population than in the overall trial population .
Overall response rate results are presented in Table 16 .
The median time to first response was 4 weeks ( range : 1 to 10 weeks ) .
The median duration of response was 3 . 8 months ( 95 % CI : 2 . 3 , not estimable ) .

SADAL was a multicenter , single - arm , open - label study of adults with relapsed or refractory DLBCL , not otherwise specified ( NOS ) , after 2 to 5 systemic regimens .
Eligible patients were not candidates for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) .
The study required a minimum of 60 days since last systemic therapy , with a minimum of 98 days in patients with refractory disease ( defined as less than partial response ) to last systemic therapy .
Patients received XPOVIO 60 mg orally on Days 1 and 3 of each week .
Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Of 134 patients evaluated , the median age was 67 years ( range : 35 - 91 ) , 59 % were male , 79 % were White , and 7 % were Asian .
Most patients ( 88 % ) had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 .
The diagnosis was de novo DLBCL not otherwise specified ( NOS ) in 75 % and transformed DLBCL in 23 % .
The median number of prior systemic therapies was 2 ( range : 1 - 5 ) , with 63 % of patients receiving 2 prior systemic therapies , 24 % receiving 3 prior therapies , and 10 % receiving 4 or 5 prior therapies .
Twenty - eight percent had documented refractory disease to the most recent therapy ; 30 % had prior autologous HSCT .
The median time from last systemic therapy to the start of XPOVIO was 5 . 4 months overall and 3 . 6 months in the patients with refractory disease .
Efficacy was based on overall response rate ( ORR ) and duration of response as assessed by an Independent Review Committee ( IRC ) using Lugano 2014 criteria ( Table 17 ) .
The median time to first response was 8 . 1 weeks ( range : 6 . 7 - 16 . 4 weeks ) .
