6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % and dexamethasone 0 . 1 % otic suspension .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
These reactions include : auricular swelling , headache , hypersensitivity , otorrhea , skin exfoliation , rash erythematous , and vomiting .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % and dexamethasone 0 . 1 % otic suspension use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Because of the minimal systemic absorption of ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone following topical otic administration of ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % and dexamethasone 0 . 1 % otic suspension , this product is expected to be of minimal risk for maternal and fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % and dexamethasone 0 . 1 % otic suspension .
Oral administration of ciprofloxacin during organogenesis at doses up to 100 mg / kg to pregnant mice and rats , and up to 30 mg / kg to pregnant rabbits did not cause fetal malformations ( see Data ) .
These doses were at least 200 times the recommended otic human dose ( ROHD in mice , rats , and rabbits , respectively , based on body surface area ( BSA ) .
With dexamethasone , malformations have been observed in animal studies after ocular and systemic administration .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % to 20 % respectively .
Data Animal Data Ciprofloxacin Developmental toxicology studies have been performed with ciprofloxacin in rats , mice , and rabbits .
The doses used in these studies are , at a minimum , approximately 200 times greater than the recommended otic human dose based on body surface area .
In rats and mice , oral doses up to 100 mg / kg administered during organogenesis ( Gestation Days ( GD ) , 6 - 17 ) were not associated with adverse developmental outcomes , including embryofetal toxicity or malformations .
A 30 mg / kg oral dose was associated with suppression of maternal and fetal body weight gain , but fetal malformations were not observed .
Intravenous administration of doses up to 20 mg / kg to pregnant rabbits was not maternally toxic and neither embryofetal toxicity nor fetal malformations were observed .
To mitigate maternal toxicity in these studies , groups of rabbits received ciprofloxacin for a different 5 day dosing period covering organogenesis ( GD 6 - 18 ) .
Dexamethasone Dexamethasone has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and rabbits following topical ophthalmic application .
In a rat oral developmental toxicity study , no adverse effects were observed at 0 . 01 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 1 times the ROHD based on BSA ) , although embryotoxicity was observed at higher doses .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone are present in human milk following topical otic administration .
Published literature reports the presence of ciprofloxacin in human milk after oral administration to lactating women .
However , because of the minimal systemic absorption of ciprofloxacin following topical otic administration of ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % and dexamethasone 0 . 1 % otic suspension , breastfeeding is not expected to result in the exposure of the infant to ciprofloxacin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk .
Dexamethasone in breast milk could suppress growth , interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production , or cause other untoward effects .
However , it is not known whether topical otic administration of ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % and dexamethasone 0 . 1 % otic suspension could result in systemic absorption that is sufficient to produce detectable quantities of dexamethasone in human milk .
There are no data on the effects of ciprofloxacin or dexamethasone on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % and dexamethasone 0 . 1 % otic suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breast - fed child from ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % and dexamethasone 0 . 1 % otic suspension .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % and dexamethasone 0 . 1 % otic suspension have been established in pediatric patients 6 months and older ( 937 patients ) in adequate and well - controlled clinical trials .
No clinically relevant changes in hearing function were observed in 69 pediatric patients ( age 4 to 12 years ) treated with ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % and dexamethasone 0 . 1 % otic suspension and tested for audiometric parameters .
10 OVERDOSAGE Due to the characteristics of this preparation , no toxic effects are to be expected with an otic overdose of this product .

Dexamethasone , a corticosteroid , has been shown to suppress inflammation by inhibiting multiple inflammatory cytokines resulting in decreased edema , fibrin deposition , capillary leakage and migration of inflammatory cells .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following a single bilateral 4 - drop ( total dose = 0 . 28 mL , 0 . 84 mg ciprofloxacin , 0 . 28 mg dexamethasone ) topical otic dose of ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % and dexamethasone 0 . 1 % otic suspension to pediatric patients after tympanostomy tube insertion , measurable plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone were observed at 6 hours following administration in 2 of 9 patients and 5 of 9 patients , respectively .
Mean ± SD peak plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin were 1 . 39 ± 0 . 880 ng / mL ( n = 9 ) .
Peak plasma concentrations ranged from 0 . 543 ng / mL to 3 . 45 ng / mL and were on average approximately 0 . 1 % of peak plasma concentrations achieved with an oral dose of 250 - mg .
Peak plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin were observed within 15 minutes to 2 hours post dose application .
Mean ± SD peak plasma concentrations of dexamethasone were 1 . 14 ± 1 . 54 ng / mL ( n = 9 ) .
Peak plasma concentrations ranged from 0 . 135 ng / mL to 5 . 10 ng / mL and were on average approximately 14 % of peak concentrations reported in the literature following an oral 0 . 5 - mg tablet dose .
Peak plasma concentrations of dexamethasone were observed within 15 minutes to 2 hours post dose application .
Dexamethasone has been added to aid in the resolution of the inflammatory response accompanying bacterial infection ( such as otorrhea in pediatric patients with AOMT ) .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme , DNA gyrase , which is needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA .
Resistance Cross - resistance has been observed between ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones .
There is generally no cross - resistance between ciprofloxacin and other classes of anti - bacterial agents , such as beta - lactams or aminoglycosides .
Antimicrobial Activity Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and clinically in otic infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Aerobic Bacteria Gram - positive Bacteria • Staphylococcus aureus • Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram - negative Bacteria • Haemophilus influenzae • Moraxella catarrhalis • Pseudomonas aeruginosa 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been completed for ciprofloxacin .
After daily oral doses of 750 mg / kg ( mice ) and 250 mg / kg ( rats ) were administered for up to 2 years , there was no evidence that ciprofloxacin had any carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects in these species .
No long - term studies of ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % and dexamethasone 0 . 1 % otic suspension have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential .
Long - term studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of topical otic dexamethasone .
Mutagenesis Eight in vitro mutagenicity tests have been conducted with ciprofloxacin , and the test results are listed below : • Salmonella / Microsome Test ( Negative ) • E . coli DNA Repair Assay ( Negative ) • Mouse Lymphoma Cell Forward Mutation Assay ( Positive ) • Chinese Hamster V79 Cell HGPRT Test ( Negative ) • Syrian Hamster Embryo Cell Transformation Assay ( Negative ) • Saccharomyces cerevisiae Point Mutation Assay ( Negative ) • Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mitotic Crossover and Gene Conversion Assay ( Negative ) • Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay ( Positive ) Thus , 2 of the 8 tests were positive , but results of the following 3 in vivo test systems gave negative results : • Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay • Micronucleus Test ( Mice ) • Dominant Lethal Test ( Mice ) Dexamethasone has been tested for in vitro and in vivo genotoxic potential and shown to be positive in the following assays : chromosomal aberrations , sister - chromatid exchange in human lymphocytes , and micronuclei and sister - chromatid exchanges in mouse bone marrow .
However , the Ames / Salmonella assay , both with and without S9 mix , did not show any increase in His + revertants .
Impairment of Fertility Fertility studies performed in male and female rats at oral doses of ciprofloxacin up to 100 mg / kg ( approximately 482 times the ROHD of ciprofloxacin based on BSA ) revealed no evidence of impairment .
Male rats received oral ciprofloxacin for 10 weeks prior to mating and females were dosed for 3 weeks prior to mating through GD 7 .
The effect of dexamethasone on fertility has not been investigated following topical otic application .
However , the lowest toxic dose of dexamethasone identified following topical dermal application was 1 . 802 mg / kg in a 26 - week study in male rats and resulted in changes to the testes , epididymis , sperm duct , prostate , seminal vesicle , Cowper ' s gland , and accessory glands .
The relevance of this study for short - term topical otic use is unknown .
