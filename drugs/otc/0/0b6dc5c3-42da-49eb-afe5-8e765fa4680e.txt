( 2 . 2 , 4 , 5 . 1 ) 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE APRETUDE is indicated in at - risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg for pre ‑ exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV - 1 infection .
Individuals must have a negative HIV - 1 test prior to initiating APRETUDE ( with or without an oral lead - in with oral cabotegravir ) for HIV - 1 PrEP [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 4 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
APRETUDE is an HIV - 1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor ( INSTI ) indicated in at - risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg for PrEP to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV - 1 infection .
Individuals must have a negative HIV - 1 test prior to initiating APRETUDE ( with or without an oral lead - in with oral cabotegravir ) for HIV - 1 PrEP .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • • HIV - 1 Screening : Screen all individuals for HIV - 1 infection immediately prior to initiating APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP and prior to each injection while taking APRETUDE .
( 2 . 2 ) • • Prior to initiating APRETUDE , an oral lead - in dosing may be used for approximately 1 month with the recommended dosage to assess the tolerability of APRETUDE .
( 2 . 4 ) • • For gluteal intramuscular injection only .
( 2 . 5 , 2 . 6 ) • • Recommended Dosing Schedule : Initiate APRETUDE with a single 600 mg ( 3 - mL ) injection given 1 month apart for 2 consecutive months on the last day of an oral lead - in if used or within 3 days and continue with the injections every 2 months thereafter .
( 2 . 5 ) 2 . 1 Dosage and Administration Overview • • APRETUDE contains cabotegravir extended - release injectable suspension in a single - dose vial [ see Dosage Forms and Strengths ( 3 ) ] .
• • APRETUDE must be administered by a healthcare provider by gluteal intramuscular injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] .
• • APRETUDE may be initiated with oral cabotegravir prior to the intramuscular injections or the patient may proceed directly to injection of APRETUDE without an oral lead - in [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
2 . 2 HIV - 1 Screening for Individuals Receiving APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP Individuals must be tested for HIV - 1 infection prior to initiating APRETUDE or oral cabotegravir , and with each subsequent injection of APRETUDE , using a test approved or cleared by the FDA for the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV - 1 infection .
If an antigen / antibody - specific test is used and provides negative results , then such negative results should be confirmed using an RNA - specific assay , even if the results of the RNA - assay are available after APRETUDE or oral cabotegravir administration [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 3 Adherence to APRETUDE Prior to starting APRETUDE , healthcare providers should carefully select individuals who agree to the required injection dosing and testing schedule and counsel individuals about the importance of adherence to scheduled dosing visits to help reduce the risk of acquiring HIV - 1 infection and development of resistance [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
2 . 4 Optional Oral Lead - in Dosing to Assess Tolerability of APRETUDE The healthcare provider and individual may decide to use an oral lead - in with oral cabotegravir prior to the initiation of APRETUDE to assess the tolerability of cabotegravir or the healthcare provider and individual may proceed directly to injection of APRETUDE without the use of an oral lead - in [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
No safety and efficacy data are available for use of APRETUDE without an oral lead - in [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
However , in HIV - 1 treatment clinical trials , data show that an oral lead - in is not needed to ensure adequate plasma cabotegravir exposure upon initiation of injections and that the safety and efficacy results of CABENUVA ( cabotegravir extended - release injectable suspension ; rilpivirine extended - release injectable suspension ) were similar when administered with and without an oral lead - in .
2 . 5 Gluteal Intramuscular Injection Dosing with APRETUDE Initiation Injections If an oral lead - in is used , initiation injections should be administered on the last day of oral lead ‑ in or within 3 days thereafter .
The recommended initiation injection doses of APRETUDE in individuals is a single 600 ‑ mg ( 3 - mL ) intramuscular injection of APRETUDE given 1 month apart for 2 consecutive months ( Table 1 and Table 2 ) .
Individuals may be given the second APRETUDE initiation injection up to 7 days before or after the date the individual is scheduled to receive the injections .
Continuation Injections After the 2 initiation injection doses given consecutively 1 month apart , the recommended continuation injection dose of APRETUDE is a single 600 - mg ( 3 - mL ) intramuscular injection of APRETUDE every 2 months ( Table 2 ) .
Individuals may be given APRETUDE up to 7 days before or after the date the individual is scheduled to receive the injections .

2 . 7 Administration Instructions Refer to the Instructions for Use for complete administration instructions with illustrations .
APRETUDE is a suspension for gluteal intramuscular injection that does not need further dilution or reconstitution .
The ventrogluteal site is recommended for injection .
A dorsogluteal approach ( upper outer quadrant ) is acceptable , if preferred by the healthcare professional .
Do not administer by any other route or anatomical site .
Consider the body mass index ( BMI ) of the individual to ensure that the needle length is sufficient to reach the gluteus muscle .
Longer needle lengths ( not included in the dosing kit ) may be required for individuals with higher BMI ( e . g . , > 30 kg / m2 ) to ensure that the injection is administered intramuscularly as opposed to subcutaneously .
Store APRETUDE at 2 ° C to 25 ° C ( 36 ° F to 77 ° F ) in the original carton until ready to use .
Exposure up to 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) permitted .
Do not freeze .
If the pack has been stored in the refrigerator , the vial should be brought to room temperature prior to administration ( not to exceed 30 ° C [ 86 ° F ] ) .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
The APRETUDE vial has a brown tint to the glass that may limit visual inspection .
Discard the vial if the medicine exhibits particulate matter or discoloration .
Shake the vial vigorously so that the suspension looks uniform before injecting .
Small air bubbles are expected and acceptable .
Once the suspension has been drawn into the syringe , the injection should be administered as soon as possible , but may remain in the syringe for up to 2 hours .
The filled syringe should not be placed in the refrigerator .
If the medicine remains in the syringe for more than 2 hours , the filled syringe and needle must be discarded [ see How Supplied / Storage and Handling ( 16 ) ] .

( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS APRETUDE is contraindicated in individuals : • • with unknown or positive HIV - 1 status [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
• • with previous hypersensitivity reaction to cabotegravir [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
• • receiving the following coadministered drugs for which significant decreases in cabotegravir plasma concentrations may occur due to uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT1A1 ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] : • • Anticonvulsants : Carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin • • Antimycobacterials : Rifampin , rifapentine • • Unknown or positive HIV - 1 status .
( 4 ) • • Previous hypersensitivity reaction to cabotegravir .
( 4 ) • • Coadministration with drugs where significant decreases in cabotegravir plasma concentrations may occur .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Comprehensive management to reduce the risk of HIV - 1 acquisition .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Potential risk of developing resistance to APRETUDE if an individual acquires HIV - 1 either before or while taking APRETUDE or following discontinuation of APRETUDE .
Reassess risk of HIV - 1 acquisition and test before each injection to confirm HIV - 1 negative status .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Residual concentrations of cabotegravir may remain in the systemic circulation of individuals up to 12 months or longer .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with other integrase inhibitors .
Discontinue APRETUDE immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving cabotegravir .
Clinical and laboratory monitoring should be considered .
Discontinue APRETUDE if hepatotoxicity is suspected .
( 5 . 5 ) • • Depressive disorders have been reported with APRETUDE .
Prompt evaluation is recommended for depressive symptoms .
( 5 . 6 ) 5 . 1 Comprehensive Management to Reduce the Risk of HIV - 1 Infection Use APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP to reduce the risk of HIV - 1 infection as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy including adherence to the administration schedule and safer sex practices , including condoms , to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) .
APRETUDE is not always effective in preventing HIV - 1 acquisition [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
The time from initiation of APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP to maximal protection against HIV - 1 infection is unknown .
Risk for HIV - 1 acquisition includes behavioral , biological , or epidemiologic factors including , but not limited to , condomless sex , past or current STIs , self - identified HIV risk , having sexual partners of unknown HIV - 1 viremic status , or sexual activity in a high prevalence area or network .
Counsel individuals on the use of other prevention measures ( e . g . , consistent and correct condom use ; knowledge of partner ( s ) ’ HIV - 1 status , including viral suppression status ; regular testing for STIs that can facilitate HIV - 1 transmission ) .
Inform individuals about and support their efforts in reducing sexual risk behavior .
Use APRETUDE to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV - 1 only in individuals confirmed to be HIV ‑ 1 negative [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
HIV - 1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undiagnosed HIV ‑ 1 infection who are taking only APRETUDE , because APRETUDE alone does not constitute a complete regimen for HIV - 1 treatment [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] ; therefore , care should be taken to minimize the risk of initiating or continuing APRETUDE before confirming the individual is HIV - 1 negative .
• • Prior to initiating APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP , ask seronegative individuals about recent ( in past month ) potential exposure events ( e . g . , condomless sex or condom breaking during sex with a partner of unknown HIV - 1 status or unknown viremic status , a recent STI ) , and evaluate for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute HIV - 1 infection ( e . g . , fever , fatigue , myalgia , skin rash ) .
• • If recent ( < 1 month ) exposures to HIV - 1 are suspected or clinical symptoms consistent with acute HIV - 1 infection are present , use a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV - 1 infection .
When using APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP , HIV - 1 testing should be repeated prior to each injection and upon diagnosis of any other STIs [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 5 ) ] .
• • If an HIV - 1 test indicates possible HIV - 1 infection , or if symptoms consistent with acute HIV - 1 infection develop following an exposure event , additional HIV testing to determine HIV status is needed .
If an individual has confirmed HIV - 1 infection , then the individual must be transitioned to a complete HIV - 1 treatment regimen .
Counsel HIV - 1 uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the recommended dosing and testing schedule for APRETUDE in order to reduce the risk of HIV - 1 acquisition and the potential development of resistance [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 , 2 . 5 ) , Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
Some individuals , such as adolescents , may benefit from frequent visits and counseling to support adherence to the dosing and testing schedule [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) , Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
5 . 2 Potential Risk of Resistance with APRETUDE There is a potential risk of developing resistance to APRETUDE if an individual acquires HIV - 1 either before or while taking APRETUDE or following discontinuation of APRETUDE [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) ] .
To minimize this risk , it is essential to clinically reassess individuals for risk of HIV - 1 acquisition and to test before each injection to confirm HIV - 1 negative status .
Individuals who are confirmed to have HIV - 1 infection must transition to a complete HIV - 1 treatment regimen .
Alternative forms of PrEP should be considered following discontinuation of APRETUDE for those individuals at continuing risk of HIV - 1 acquisition and initiated within 2 months of the final injection of APRETUDE .
5 . 3 Long - Acting Properties and Potential Associated Risks with APRETUDE Residual concentrations of cabotegravir may remain in the systemic circulation of individuals for prolonged periods ( up to 12 months or longer ) .
It is important to carefully select individuals who agree to the required every - 2 - month injection dosing schedule because non - adherence to every ‑ 2 - monthly injections or missed doses could lead to HIV - 1 acquisition and development of resistance .
Healthcare providers should take the prolonged - release characteristics of cabotegravir into consideration when APRETUDE is prescribed [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 .
3 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 2 ) , Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
5 . 4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with other integrase inhibitors and could occur with APRETUDE [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Administration of cabotegravir oral lead - in dosing was used in clinical studies to help identify participants who may be at risk of a hypersensitivity reaction .
Remain vigilant and discontinue APRETUDE if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Discontinue APRETUDE immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop ( including , but not limited to , severe rash , or rash accompanied by fever , general malaise , fatigue , muscle or joint aches , blisters , mucosal involvement [ oral blisters or lesions ] , conjunctivitis , facial edema , hepatitis , eosinophilia , angioedema , difficulty breathing ) .
Clinical status , including liver transaminases , should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated .
For information regarding the long - acting properties of APRETUDE [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 5 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity has been reported in a limited number of individuals receiving cabotegravir with or without known pre - existing hepatic disease or identifiable risk factors [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Clinical and laboratory monitoring should be considered and APRETUDE should be discontinued if hepatotoxicity is suspected and individuals managed as clinically indicated .
For information regarding the long - acting properties of APRETUDE [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 6 Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders ( including depression , depressed mood , major depression , persistent depressive disorder , suicide ideation or attempt ) have been reported with APRETUDE [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Promptly evaluate individuals with depressive symptoms to assess whether the symptoms are related to APRETUDE and to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits .
5 . 7 Risk of Reduced Drug Concentration of APRETUDE Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of APRETUDE and other drugs may result in reduced drug concentration of APRETUDE [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) ] .
See Table 8 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions , including dosing recommendations .
Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during use of , and after discontinuation of APRETUDE ; review concomitant medications during use of APRETUDE [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 , 7 . 4 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described below and in other sections of the labeling : • • Hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • • Hepatotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • • Depressive disorders [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( all grades ) observed in at least 1 % of subjects receiving APRETUDE were injection site reactions , diarrhea , headache , pyrexia , fatigue , sleep disorders , nausea , dizziness , flatulence , abdominal pain , vomiting , myalgia , rash , decreased appetite , somnolence , back pain , and upper respiratory tract infection .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Refer to the full prescribing information for important drug interactions with APRETUDE .
( 4 , 5 . 7 , 7 ) • • Drugs that induce uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT1A1 ) may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of cabotegravir .
( 4 , 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Use of Other Antiretroviral Drugs after Discontinuation of APRETUDE Residual concentrations of cabotegravir may remain in the systemic circulation of individuals for prolonged periods ( up to 12 months or longer ) .
These residual concentrations are not expected to affect the exposures of antiretroviral drugs that are initiated after discontinuation of APRETUDE [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect APRETUDE Cabotegravir is primarily metabolized by UGT1A1 with some contribution from UGT1A9 .
Drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 or 1A9 are expected to decrease cabotegravir plasma concentrations ; therefore , coadministration of APRETUDE with these drugs is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
7 . 3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Information regarding potential drug interactions with cabotegravir is provided in Table 8 .
These recommendations are based on either drug interaction trials following oral administration of cabotegravir or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of the interaction [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Table 8 includes potentially significant interactions but is not all inclusive .
Table 8 .
Drug Interactions with APRETUDE ↑ = Increase , ↓ = Decrease , ↔ = No change .
Concomitant Drug Class : Drug Name Effect on Concentration Clinical Comment Anticonvulsants : Carbamazepine Oxcarbazepine Phenobarbital Phenytoin ↓ Cabotegravir Coadministration is contraindicated with APRETUDE due to potential for significant decreases in plasma concentration of APRETUDE .
Antimycobacterials : Rifampin Rifapentine ↓ Cabotegravir Antimycobacterial : Rifabutin ↓ Cabotegravir When rifabutin is started before or concomitantly with the first initiation injection of APRETUDE , the recommended dosing of APRETUDE is one 600 - mg ( 3 - mL ) injection , followed 2 weeks later by a second 600 - mg ( 3 - mL ) initiation injection and monthly thereafter while on rifabutin .
When rifabutin is started at the time of the second initiation injection or later , the recommended dosing schedule of APRETUDE is 600 mg ( 3 mL ) monthly while on rifabutin .
After stopping rifabutin , the recommended dosing schedule of APRETUDE is 600 mg ( 3 mL ) every 2 months .
Narcotic analgesic : Methadone ↔ Cabotegravir ↓ Methadone No dose adjustment of methadone is required when starting coadministration of methadone with APRETUDE .
However , clinical monitoring is recommended as methadone maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some individuals .
7 . 4 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with Cabotegravir Based on drug interaction study results , the following drugs can be coadministered with cabotegravir ( non - antiretrovirals ) or given after discontinuation of cabotegravir ( antiretrovirals and non - antiretrovirals ) without a dose adjustment : etravirine , midazolam , oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol , and rilpivirine [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Lactation : Assess the benefit - risk of using APRETUDE to the infant while breastfeeding due to the potential for adverse reactions and residual concentrations in the systemic circulation for up to 12 months or longer after discontinuation .
( 8 . 2 ) • • Pediatrics : Not recommended in individuals weighing < 35 kg .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to APRETUDE during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register individuals by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary There are insufficient human data on the use of APRETUDE during pregnancy to adequately assess a drug - associated risk of birth defects and miscarriage .
While there are insufficient human data to assess the risk of neural tube defects ( NTDs ) with exposure to APRETUDE during pregnancy , NTDs were associated with dolutegravir , another integrase inhibitor .
Healthcare providers should discuss the benefit - risk of using APRETUDE with individuals of childbearing potential or during pregnancy .
Cabotegravir use in pregnant women has not been evaluated .
APRETUDE should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
The APR has been established to monitor for birth defects following prenatal exposure to antiretrovirals .
The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR .
The background rate for major birth defects in a U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) is 2 . 7 % .
The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U . S . general population is 15 % to 20 % .
The APR uses the MACDP as the U . S . reference population for birth defects in the general population .
The MACDP evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at < 20 weeks ’ gestation .
In animal reproduction studies with oral cabotegravir , a delay in the onset of parturition and increased stillbirths and neonatal deaths were observed in a rat pre - and postnatal development study at > 28 times the exposure at the recommended human dose ( RHD ) .
No evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with oral cabotegravir in rats or rabbits ( > 28 times or similar to the exposure at the RHD , respectively ) given during organogenesis ( see Data ) .
Clinical Considerations Cabotegravir is detected in systemic circulation for up to 12 months or longer after discontinuing injections of APRETUDE ; therefore , consideration should be given to the potential for fetal exposure during pregnancy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Data Human Data : Data from a birth outcome surveillance study in Botswana showed that dolutegravir , another integrase inhibitor , was associated with increased risk of NTDs when administered at the time of conception and in early pregnancy .
Data from clinical trials are insufficient to address this risk with cabotegravir .
Animal Data : Cabotegravir was administered orally to pregnant rats at 0 , 0 . 5 , 5 , or 1 , 000 mg / kg / day from 15 days before cohabitation , during cohabitation , and from Gestation Days 0 to 17 .
There were no effects on fetal viability when fetuses were delivered by caesarean , although a minor decrease in fetal body weight was observed at 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ( > 28 times the exposure in humans at the RHD ) .
No drug - related fetal toxicities were observed at 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 13 times the exposure in humans at the RHD ) , and no drug - related fetal malformations were observed at any dose .
Cabotegravir was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at 0 , 30 , 500 , or 2 , 000 mg / kg / day from Gestation Days 7 to 19 .
No drug - related fetal toxicities were observed at 2 , 000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 7 times the exposure in humans at the RHD ) .
In a rat pre - and postnatal development study , cabotegravir was administered orally to pregnant rats at 0 , 0 . 5 , 5 , or 1 , 000 mg / kg / day from Gestation Day 6 to Lactation Day 21 .
A delay in the onset of parturition and increases in the number of stillbirths and neonatal deaths by Lactation Day 4 were observed at 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ( > 28 times the exposure in humans at the RHD ) ; there were no alterations to growth and development of surviving offspring .
In a cross - fostering study , similar incidences of stillbirths and early postnatal deaths were observed when rat pups born to cabotegravir - treated mothers were nursed from birth by control mothers .
There was no effect on neonatal survival of control pups nursed from birth by cabotegravir - treated mothers .
A lower dose of 5 mg / kg / day ( 13 times the exposure at the RHD ) was not associated with delayed parturition or neonatal mortality in rats .
Studies in pregnant rats showed that cabotegravir crosses the placenta and can be detected in fetal tissue .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known if cabotegravir is present in human breast milk , affects human milk production , or has effects on the breastfed infant .
When administered to lactating rats , cabotegravir was present in milk ( see Data ) .
If cabotegravir is present in human milk , residual exposures may remain for 12 months or longer after the last injections have been administered [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Because of detectable cabotegravir concentrations in systemic circulation for up to 12 months or longer after discontinuing injections of APRETUDE , it is recommended that women breastfeed only if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant .
Data Animal Data : Animal lactation studies with cabotegravir have not been conducted .
However , cabotegravir was detected in the plasma of nursing pups on Lactation Day 10 in the rat pre - and postnatal development study .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP in at - risk adolescents weighing at least 35 kg is supported by data from 2 adequate and well - controlled trials of APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP in adults with additional safety and pharmacokinetic data from studies in HIV - 1 infected adults who were administered CABENUVA , and in HIV - 1 infected pediatric subjects who were administered separate components of CABENUVA in addition to their current antiretroviral therapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP is being evaluated in 2 open - label multicenter clinical trials in adolescent individuals .
Fifty - nine adolescents have been enrolled .
Of these , 54 adolescent participants received one or more injections .
In adolescents receiving APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP , the safety data were comparable to the safety data reported in adults receiving APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP .
While using APRETUDE , HIV - 1 testing should be conducted prior to initiating APRETUDE ( with or without an oral lead - in with oral cabotegravir ) and prior to each injection of APRETUDE .
Adolescents may benefit from more frequent visits and counseling to support adherence to the dosing and testing schedule [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The safety , efficacy , and pharmacokinetics of APRETUDE in pediatric participants younger than 12 years of age or weighing < 35 kg have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals .
There are limited data available on the use of APRETUDE in individuals aged 65 years and older .
In general , caution should be exercised in administration of APRETUDE in elderly individuals reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Based on studies with oral cabotegravir , no dosage adjustment of APRETUDE is necessary for individuals with mild ( creatinine clearance ≥ 60 to < 90 mL / min ) or moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance ≥ 30 to < 60 mL / min ) .
In individuals with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 15 to < 30 mL / min ) or end - stage renal disease ( creatinine clearance < 15 mL / min ) , increased monitoring for adverse effects is recommended [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In individuals with end - stage renal disease not on dialysis , effects on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir are unknown .
As cabotegravir is > 99 % protein bound , dialysis is not expected to alter exposures of cabotegravir .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Based on studies with oral cabotegravir , no dosage adjustment of APRETUDE is necessary for individuals with mild or moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh A or B ) .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir is unknown [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known specific treatment for overdose with APRETUDE .
If overdose occurs , monitor the individual and apply standard supportive treatment as required as well as observation of the clinical status of the individual .
As APRETUDE is highly bound to plasma proteins , it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by dialysis .
Consider the prolonged exposure to APRETUDE following an injection when assessing treatment needs and recovery [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION APRETUDE contains cabotegravir extended - release injectable suspension , an HIV INSTI .
The chemical name of cabotegravir is ( 3 S , 11 aR ) - N - [ ( 2 , 4 - difluorophenyl ) methyl ] - 6 - hydroxy - 3 - methyl - 5 , 7 - dioxo - 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 11 a - hexahydro [ 1 , 3 ] oxazolo [ 3 , 2 - a ] pyrido [ 1 , 2 - d ] pyrazine - 8 - carboxamide .
The empirical formula is C19H17F2N3O5 and the molecular weight is 405 . 35 g / mol .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Cabotegravir extended - release injectable suspension is a white to light pink free - flowing suspension for intramuscular injection in a sterile single - dose vial .
Each vial delivers 600 mg / 3 mL ( 200 mg / mL ) of cabotegravir and mannitol ( 105 mg ) , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 3350 ( 60 mg ) , polysorbate 20 ( 60 mg ) , and Water for Injection .
The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Cabotegravir is an HIV - 1 antiretroviral drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] in a long - acting formulation .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose of cabotegravir 150 mg orally every 12 hours ( 10 times the recommended total daily oral lead ‑ in dosage of APRETUDE ) , the QT interval is not prolonged to any clinically relevant extent .
Administration of 3 doses of cabotegravir 150 mg orally every 12 hours resulted in a geometric mean Cmax approximately 2 . 8 - fold and 5 . 6 - fold above the geometric mean steady - state Cmax associated with the recommended 30 - mg dose of oral cabotegravir and the recommended 600 - mg dose given every 2 months of cabotegravir extended - release injectable suspension , respectively .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption , Distribution , Metabolism , and Excretion The pharmacokinetic properties of cabotegravir are provided in Table 9 .
The multiple - dose pharmacokinetic parameters are provided in Table 10 .

Pharmacokinetic Parameters following Once - Daily Oral Cabotegravir and following Initiation and Every - 2 - Month Continuation Intramuscular Injections of APRETUDEIM = Intramuscular .
a Pharmacokinetic parameter values were based on individual post - hoc estimates from cabotegravir population pharmacokinetic models for patients in Phase 3 treatment studies of HIV treatment .
b tau is dosing interval : 24 hours for oral administration , 1 month for the initial injection , and 2 months for every 2 months for intramuscular injections of extended - release injectable suspension .
c Oral lead - in pharmacokinetic parameter values represent steady state .
d Initial injection Cmax values primarily reflect oral dosing because the initial injection was administered on the same day as the last oral dose ; however , AUC ( 0 - tau ) and the Ctau values reflect the initial injection .
When administered without oral lead - in to HIV - infected recipients ( n = 110 ) , the observed cabotegravir geometric mean ( 5 th , 95 th percentile ) Cmax ( 1 - week post ‑ initial injection ) was 1 . 89 mcg / mL ( 0 . 438 , 5 . 69 ) and Ctau was 1 . 43 mcg / mL ( 0 . 403 , 3 . 90 ) .

There are no data available for the use of cabotegravir in participants with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus co - infection in PrEP studies .
Renal Impairment : With oral cabotegravir , no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir are expected in individuals with mild , moderate , or severe renal impairment .
Cabotegravir has not been studied in participants with end - stage renal disease not on dialysis .
As cabotegravir is > 99 % protein bound , dialysis is not expected to alter exposures of cabotegravir [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment : No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir are expected in mild to moderate ( Child - Pugh A or B ) hepatic impairment .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir has not been studied [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Gender : Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed no clinically relevant effect of gender on the exposure of cabotegravir .
In addition , no clinically relevant differences in plasma cabotegravir concentrations were observed in PrEP studies by gender , including in cisgender men and transgender women ( + / - hormone use ) .
Therefore , no dose adjustment is necessary based on gender .
Geriatrics : No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals .
There are limited data available on the use of cabotegravir in individuals aged 65 years and older .
In general , caution should be exercised in administration of APRETUDE in elderly individuals reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatrics : Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed no clinically relevant differences in exposure between the HIV - 1 infected adolescent and HIV - 1 infected and uninfected adult participants from the cabotegravir development program ; therefore , no dosage adjustment is needed for adolescents weighing at least 35 kg ( Table 11 ) .

In vitro , cabotegravir inhibited renal OAT1 ( IC50 = 0 . 81 microM ) and OAT3 ( IC50 = 0 . 41 microM ) .
Based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) modeling , cabotegravir may increase the AUC of OAT1 / 3 substrates up to approximately 80 % .
In vitro , cabotegravir did not induce CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , or CYP3A4 .
Simulations using PBPK modeling show that no clinically significant interaction is expected during coadministration of cabotegravir with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 .
In vitro , cabotegravir was not a substrate of OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OATP2B1 , or OCT1 .
Cabotegravir is a substrate of P - gp and BCRP in vitro ; however , because of its high permeability , no alteration in cabotegravir absorption is expected with coadministration of P - gp or BCRP inhibitors .
Drug interaction studies were not conducted with injectable cabotegravir .
Drug interaction studies with oral cabotegravir are summarized in Tables 12 and 13 .

The mean 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) value of cabotegravir in a strand transfer assay using purified recombinant HIV - 1 integrase was 3 . 0 nM .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Cabotegravir exhibited antiviral activity against laboratory strains of HIV - 1 ( subtype B , n = 4 ) with mean 50 percent effective concentration ( EC50 ) value of 0 . 22 nM to 1 . 7 nM in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) and 293 cells .
Cabotegravir demonstrated antiviral activity in PBMCs against a panel of 24 HIV - 1 clinical isolates ( 3 in each of group M subtypes A , B , C , D , E , F , and G and 3 in group O ) with a median EC50 value of 0 . 19 nM ( range : 0 . 02 nM to 1 . 06 nM , n = 24 ) .
The median EC50 value against subtype B clinical isolates was 0 . 05 nM ( range : 0 . 02 to 0 . 50 nM , n = 3 ) .
Against clinical HIV - 2 isolates , the median EC50 value was 0 . 12 nM ( range : 0 . 10 nM to 0 . 14 nM , n = 4 ) .
In cell culture , cabotegravir was not antagonistic in combination with the non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) rilpivirine , or the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) FTC , lamivudine ( 3 TC ) , or TDF .
Resistance Cell Culture : Cabotegravir - resistant viruses were selected during passage of HIV - 1 strain IIIB in MT - 2 cells in the presence of cabotegravir .
Amino acid substitutions in integrase that emerged and conferred decreased susceptibility to cabotegravir included Q146L ( fold change : 1 . 3 to 4 . 6 ) , S153Y ( fold change : 2 . 8 to 8 . 4 ) , and I162M ( fold change : 2 . 8 ) .
The integrase substitution T124A also emerged alone ( fold change : 1 . 1 to 7 . 4 in cabotegravir susceptibility ) , in combination with S153Y ( fold change : 3 . 6 to 6 . 6 in cabotegravir susceptibility ) or I162M ( 2 . 8 - fold change in cabotegravir susceptibility ) .
Cell culture passage of virus harboring integrase substitutions Q148H , Q148K , or Q148R selected for additional substitutions ( C56S , V72I , L74M , V75A , T122N , E138K , G140S , G149A , and M154I ) , with substituted viruses having reduced susceptibility to cabotegravir of 2 . 0 - fold to 410 - fold change .
The combinations of E138K + Q148K and V72I + E138K + Q148K conferred the greatest reductions of 53 - fold to 260 ‑ fold change and 410 - fold change , respectively .
Clinical Trials : There were 12 incident infections and 4 prevalent infections among subjects in the APRETUDE arm of HPTN 083 .
Genotypic data were generated for viruses from 13 of these 16 subjects ( 4 subjects with prevalent infections and 9 subjects with incident infections ) and phenotypic data were generated for 3 of these viruses .
INSTI resistance - associated substitutions were detected in 5 viruses from subjects who achieved target plasma concentrations of cabotegravir ( ≥ 0 . 65 mcg / mL [ 1 . 6 μM ] ) and included R263K ( 2 - fold less susceptible to cabotegravir ) , E138A + Q148R ( 6 - fold less susceptible to cabotegravir ) , E138K + Q148K , G140A + Q148R ( 13 - fold less susceptible to cabotegravir ) , and L74I + E138E / K + G140G / S + Q148R + E157Q .
There were 3 incident infections and 1 prevalent infection among subjects in the APRETUDE arm of HPTN 084 .
All 3 incident infections occurred during periods with cabotegravir exposures below the target concentration .
No variants expressing INSTI resistance - associated substitutions were detected .
Cross - Resistance Cross - resistance has been observed among INSTIs .
Cabotegravir had reduced susceptibility ( > 5 - fold change ) to recombinant HIV - 1 strain NL432 viruses harboring the following integrase amino acid substitutions : G118R , Q148K , Q148R , T66K + L74M , E92Q + N155H , E138A + Q148R , E138K + Q148K / R , G140C + Q148R , G140S + Q148H / K / R , Y143H + N155H , and Q148R + N155H ( range : 5 . 1 - fold to 81 - fold ) .
The substitutions E138K + Q148K and Q148R + N155H conferred the greatest reductions in susceptibility of 81 - fold and 61 - fold , respectively .
Viruses harboring E138A + Q148R or G140A + Q148R with reduced susceptibility to cabotegravir were isolated from subjects using APRETUDE in HPTN 083 .
These viruses remained susceptible to bictegravir and dolutegravir but had cross - resistance to elvitegravir and raltegravir .
Virologic failure isolates from cabotegravir + rilpivirine treatment in FLAIR , ATLAS , and ATLAS - 2 M exhibited cross - resistance to INSTIs and NNRTIs .
All confirmed virologic isolates with genotypic evidence of cabotegravir resistance had cross - resistance to elvitegravir and raltegravir but retained phenotypic susceptibility to bictegravir and dolutegravir when tested .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Two - year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were conducted with cabotegravir .
In mice , no drug - related increases in tumor incidence were observed at cabotegravir exposures ( AUC ) up to approximately 8 times ( males ) and 7 times ( females ) higher than those in humans at the RHD .
In rats , no drug - related increases in tumor incidence were observed at cabotegravir exposures up to approximately 26 times higher than those in humans at the RHD .
Mutagenesis Cabotegravir was not genotoxic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay , mouse lymphoma assay , or in the in vivo rodent micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility In rats , no effects on fertility were observed at cabotegravir exposures ( AUC ) > 20 times ( male ) and 28 times ( female ) the exposure in humans at the RHD .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Clinical Trials in Adults for HIV - 1 Pre - Exposure Prophylaxis The safety and efficacy of APRETUDE to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV - 1 infection were evaluated in 2 randomized , double - blind , controlled , multinational trials , HPTN 083 in HIV ‑ 1 uninfected men and transgender women who have sex with men and have evidence of high - risk behavior for HIV - 1 infection and HPTN 084 in HIV - 1 uninfected cisgender women at risk of acquiring HIV - 1 .
Participants randomized to receive APRETUDE initiated oral lead - in dosing with 1 oral cabotegravir 30 - mg tablet and a placebo daily for up to 5 weeks , followed by APRETUDE 600 ‑ mg ( 3 - mL ) intramuscular injection at months 1 and 2 and every 2 months thereafter and a daily placebo tablet .
Participants randomized to receive TRUVADA initiated oral TRUVADA ( TDF 300 mg / FTC 200 mg ) and placebo daily for up to 5 weeks , followed by oral TRUVADA daily and placebo intramuscular injection at months 1 and 2 and every 2 months thereafter .
Trial 201738 ( HPTN 083 [ NCT02720094 ] ) In HPTN 083 , a non - inferiority study , 4 , 566 cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men were randomized 1 : 1 and received either APRETUDE ( n = 2 , 281 ) or TRUVADA ( n = 2 , 285 ) as blinded study medication up to Week 153 .
At baseline , the median age of participants was 26 years , 12 % were transgender women , 72 % were non - White , and 67 % were younger than 30 years .
The primary endpoint was the rate of incident HIV - 1 infections among participants randomized to daily oral cabotegravir and intramuscular injections of APRETUDE every 2 months compared with daily oral TRUVADA ( corrected for early stopping ) .
The primary analysis demonstrated the superiority of APRETUDE compared with TRUVADA with a 66 % reduction in the risk of acquiring HIV - 1 infection , hazard ratio ( 95 % CI ) 0 . 34 ( 0 . 18 , 0 . 62 ) ; further testing revealed 1 of the infections on APRETUDE to be prevalent then yielding a 69 % reduction in the risk of HIV - 1 incident infection relative to TRUVADA ( Table 14 ) .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the individual to read the FDA - approved patient labeling ( Patient Information ) .
Important Information for Uninfected Individuals Taking APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP Advise HIV - 1 uninfected individuals about the following [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] : • • APRETUDE should be used for PrEP as part of an overall HIV - 1 infection prevention strategy , including adherence to the administration schedule and safer sex practices , including condoms , to reduce the risk of STIs .
• • APRETUDE is not always effective in preventing HIV - 1 acquisition [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
The time from initiation of APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP to maximal protection against HIV - 1 infection is unknown .
• • Counsel individuals on the use of other prevention measures ( e . g . , knowledge of partner HIV - 1 status , testing for STIs condom use ) .
Inform individuals about and support their efforts in reducing sexual risk behavior .
• • APRETUDE should be used to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV - 1 only in individuals confirmed to be HIV - 1 negative .
HIV - 1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undiagnosed HIV - 1 infection who are taking only APRETUDE , because APRETUDE alone does not constitute a complete regimen for HIV - 1 treatment ; therefore , care should be taken to minimize the risk of initiating or continuing APRETUDE before confirming the individual is HIV - 1 negative .
• • If recent ( < 1 month ) exposures to HIV - 1 are suspected or clinical symptoms consistent with acute HIV - 1 infection are present , use a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV - 1 infection .
• • When using APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP , HIV - 1 testing should be repeated prior to each injection of APRETUDE , and upon diagnosis of any other STIs .
• • If an HIV - 1 test indicates possible HIV - 1 infection , or if symptoms consistent with acute HIV - 1 infection develop following an exposure event , additional HIV testing to determine HIV status is needed .
If an individual has confirmed HIV - 1 infection , then the individual must be transitioned to a complete HIV - 1 treatment regimen .
• • Some individuals , such as adolescents , may benefit from frequent visits and counseling to support adherence .
Potential Risk of Resistance with APRETUDE Advise individuals there is a potential risk of developing resistance to APRETUDE if HIV - 1 is acquired either before or while taking APRETUDE or following discontinuation of APRETUDE [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
To minimize this , it is essential that individuals are clinically reassessed for risk of HIV - 1 acquisition and tested frequently to confirm HIV - 1 negative status .
Advise individuals who are confirmed to have with HIV - 1 infection to consult with their healthcare professional , as HIV - 1 treatment must be initiated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Inform individuals that alternative forms of PrEP should be considered following discontinuation of APRETUDE for those at continuing risk of HIV - 1 acquisition and initiated within 2 months of the final injection of APRETUDE [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Long - Acting Properties of APRETUDE Advise individuals that APRETUDE is an extended - release injectable that may be systemically present for 12 months or longer and consideration should be taken regarding the prolonged release characteristics when APRETUDE is discontinued [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Adherence to APRETUDE Counsel individuals about the importance of continued medication adherence and scheduled visits to help reduce the risk of acquiring HIV - 1 infection and development of resistance [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Hypersensitivity Reactions Advise individuals to immediately contact their healthcare provider if they develop a rash .
Instruct individuals to immediately stop taking APRETUDE and seek medical attention if they develop a rash associated with any of the following symptoms : fever ; generally ill feeling ; extreme tiredness ; muscle or joint aches ; blisters ; oral blisters or lesions ; eye inflammation ; facial swelling ; swelling of the eyes , lips , tongue , or mouth ; difficulty breathing ; and / or signs and symptoms of liver problems ( e . g . , yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes ; dark or tea ‑ colored urine ; pale - colored stools or bowel movements ; nausea ; vomiting ; loss of appetite ; or pain , aching , or sensitivity on the right side below the ribs ) .
Advise individuals that if hypersensitivity occurs , they will be closely monitored , laboratory tests will be ordered , and appropriate therapy will be initiated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Hepatotoxicity Inform individuals that hepatotoxicity has been reported with cabotegravir [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Inform individuals that clinical and laboratory monitoring should be considered and APRETUDE should be discontinued if hepatoxicity is confirmed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Depressive Disorders Inform individuals that depressive disorders ( including depression , depressed mood , major depression , persistent depressive disorder , suicide ideation or attempt ) have been reported with APRETUDE [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Advise individuals to seek prompt medical evaluation if they experience depressive symptoms [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interactions Inform individuals that APRETUDE may interact with other drugs and may reduce exposure of APRETUDE ; therefore , advise individuals to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medication [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) ] .
Missed Dose Inform individuals that APRETUDE can remain in the body for up to 12 months or longer after receiving their last injection .
Advise individuals that they should contact their healthcare provider if they miss or plan to miss a scheduled monthly injection visit and that oral dosing may be used to replace up to 2 consecutive monthly injections .
Advise individuals that if they discontinue use of APRETUDE , they will need to take other medicines for HIV - 1 PrEP [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 , 2 . 6 ) ] .
Pregnancy Registry Inform individuals that there is an antiretroviral pregnancy registry to monitor fetal outcomes in those exposed to APRETUDE during pregnancy .
Individuals who are of reproductive potential should be informed of the long duration of exposure of APRETUDE and that there is very limited clinical experience in human pregnancy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Lactation Inform individuals that due to the potential for adverse reactions and residual concentrations in the systemic circulation for up to 12 months or longer after discontinuing injections of APRETUDE , it is recommended that women breastfeed only if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant .

APR : 1 PI Patient Information APRETUDE ( AP - reh - tood ) ( cabotegravir extended - release injectable suspension ) for intramuscular use What is the most important information I should know about APRETUDE ?
Important information for people who receive APRETUDE to help reduce their risk of getting human immunodeficiency virus - 1 ( HIV - 1 ) infection , also called pre - exposure prophylaxis or “ PrEP ” : Before receiving APRETUDE to reduce your risk of getting HIV - 1 : • • You must be HIV - 1 negative to start APRETUDE .
You must get tested to make sure that you do not already have HIV - 1 infection .
• • Do not receive APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP unless you are confirmed to be HIV - 1 negative .
• • Some HIV - 1 tests can miss HIV - 1 infection in a person who has recently become infected .
If you have flu - like symptoms , you could have recently become infected with HIV - 1 .
Tell your healthcare provider if you had a flu - like illness within the last month before starting APRETUDE or at any time while receiving APRETUDE .
Symptoms of new HIV - 1 infection include : • • tiredness • • joint or muscle aches • • sore throat • • rash • • enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin • • fever • • headache • • vomiting or diarrhea • • night sweats While you are receiving APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP : • • APRETUDE does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections .
Practice safer sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to reduce the risk of getting sexually transmitted infections .
• • You must stay HIV - 1 negative to keep receiving APRETUDE for HIV - 1 PrEP .
• • Know your HIV - 1 status and the HIV - 1 status of your partners .
• • Ask your partners with HIV - 1 if they are taking anti - HIV - 1 medicines and have an undetectable viral load .
An undetectable viral load is when the amount of virus in the blood is too low to be measured in a lab test .
To maintain an undetectable viral load , your partners must keep taking HIV - 1 medicine as prescribed .
Your risk of getting HIV - 1 is lower if your partners with HIV - 1 are taking effective treatment .
• • Get tested for HIV - 1 with each APRETUDE injection or when your healthcare provider tells you .
You should not miss any HIV - 1 tests .
If you become HIV - 1 infected and continue receiving APRETUDE because you do not know you are HIV - 1 infected , the HIV - 1 infection may become harder to treat .
• • Get tested for other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis , chlamydia , and gonorrhea .
These infections make it easier for HIV - 1 to infect you .

If the pack has been stored in the refrigerator , is it safe to warm the vial up to room temperature more quickly ?
The vial should be brought to room temperature before you are ready to give the injection , but make sure the vial does not get above 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) .
• Do not use any heating methods , other than using the warmth of your hands .
• 2 .
How long can APRETUDE be left in the syringe ?
It is best to inject ( room temperature ) APRETUDE as soon as possible after drawing it up .
However , APRETUDE can remain in the syringe for up to 2 hours before injecting .
If the medicine remains in the syringe for more than 2 hours , the filled syringe and needle must be discarded .
• 3 .
Why do I need to inject air into the vial ?
Injecting 1 mL of air into the vial makes it easier to draw up the medicine into the syringe .
Without the air , some liquid may flow back into the vial unintentionally , leaving less medicine than intended in the syringe .
• 4 .
Why is the ventrogluteal administration approach recommended ?
The ventrogluteal approach into the gluteus medius muscle is recommended because it is located away from major nerves and blood vessels .
A dorsogluteal approach into the gluteus maximus muscle is acceptable , if preferred by the healthcare professional .
The injection should not be administered in any other site .
