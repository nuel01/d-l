1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % is indicated for the restoration and maintenance of circulating blood volume for : Hypovolemia .
( 1 . 1 ) Hypoalbuminemia .
( 1 . 2 ) Prevention of central volume depletion after paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites .
( 1 . 3 ) 1 . 1 Hypovolemia ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % is indicated in the emergency treatment of hypovolemia with or without shock .
Its effectiveness in reversing hypovolemia depends largely upon its ability to draw interstitial fluid into the circulation .
It is most effective in patients who are well hydrated .
When blood volume deficit is the result of hemorrhage , compatible red blood cells or whole blood should be administered as quickly as possible .
[ 1 , 2 ] ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % should be used when hydration is not adequate .
When hypovolemia is long standing and hypoalbuminemia exists accompanied by adequate hydration or edema , 20 % - 25 % albumin solutions should be used .
[ 1 ] 1 . 2 Hypoalbuminemia For subjects with hypoalbuminemia who are critically ill and / or are bleeding actively , ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % infusions may be indicated .
[ 3 ] When albumin deficit is the result of excessive protein loss , the effect of administration of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % will be temporary unless the underlying disorder is reversed .
1 . 3 Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites ( Treatment Adjunct ) ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % may be used to maintain cardiovascular function following the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid after paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites .
[ 2 ] 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Intravenous use only .
Daily dose should not exceed 2 g per kg body weight .
( 2 . 1 ) Indication Dose Hypovolemia Adults : 25 g ( 2 . 1 ) Children : ( less than 13 years ) 2 . 5 to 1 . 25 g ( 2 . 1 ) Hypoalbuminemia Adults : 50 to 75 g ( 2 . 1 ) Prevention of volume depletion after paracentesis Adults : 8 g for every 1 , 000 mL of ascitic fluid removed ( 2 . 1 ) Do not dilute with sterile water for injection as this may cause hemolysis in recipients .
( 5 . 6 ) Store protected from light .
( 16 ) Do not freeze .
( 16 ) If large volumes ( greater than 1500 ml ) are administered , warm the product to room temperature before use .
( 2 . 2 ) Bottles are for single use only .
( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 1 Dosage General Recommendations The concentration of the albumin preparation , dosage and the infusion rate should be adjusted to the patient ’ s individual requirements .
The dose required depends on the body weight of the patient , the severity of trauma or illness and on continuing fluid and protein losses .
Measures of adequacy of circulating volume and not plasma albumin levels should be used to determine the dose required .
The daily dose should not exceed 2 g of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % per kg of body weight .
Hypovolemia In adults , an intravenous infusion of 25 g of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % should be given .
If adequate response ( stabilization of circulation ) is not achieved within 15 to 30 minutes , an additional dose may be given .
In spite of limited information about the efficacy in pediatric subjects , an intravenous infusion of 2 . 5 to 12 . 5 g or 0 . 5 to 1 g / kg body weight may be given .
If adequate response ( stabilization of circulation ) is not achieved within 15 to 30 minutes , an additional dose may be given .
Hemodilution may follow administration of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % .
If hemorrhage has occurred , this may result in relative anemia .
This condition should be controlled by the supplemental administration of compatible red blood cells or compatible whole blood .
Hypoalbuminemia In adults , intravenous infusion of 50 to 75 g of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % may be used .
Hypoalbuminemia is usually accompanied by a hidden extravascular albumin deficiency of equal magnitude .
This total body albumin deficit must be considered when determining the amount of albumin necessary to reverse the hypoalbuminemia .
In burns , therapy usually starts with the administration of large volumes of crystalloid injection to maintain plasma volume .
After 24 hours , ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % may be added at an initial dose of 25 g with the dose adjusted thereafter to maintain a plasma protein concentration of 2 . 5 g per 100 mL or a serum protein concentration of 5 . 2 g / 100 mL .
Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites In adults , intravenous infusion of 8 g of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % may be given for every 1 , 000 mL of ascitic fluid removed .
2 . 2 Administration Intravenous use only .
Prior to administration , parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for turbidity and discoloration , whenever solution and container permit .
Do not dilute with sterile water for injection .
Do not use solutions of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % which are cloudy or have deposits .
Once the infusion container has been opened the contents should be used immediately .
Discard the unused portion .
Filtration of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 5 % is not required .
The infusion rate should be adjusted according to the individual circumstances and the indication .
In plasma exchange during paracentesis , the infusion rate may be higher and should be adjusted to the rate of removal .
If large volumes ( greater than 1500 ml ) are administered , the product should be warmed to room temperature before use .
