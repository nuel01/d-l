DESCRIPTION : Ciclopirox Gel 0 . 77 % contains a synthetic antifungal agent , ciclopirox .
It is intended for topical dermatologic use only .
Each gram of ciclopirox gel 0 . 77 % contains 7 . 70 mg of ciclopirox in a gel consisting of purified water , isopropyl alcohol , octyldodecanol , dimethicone copolyol 190 , carbomer 980 , sodium hydroxide , and docusate sodium .
Ciclopirox gel 0 . 77 % is a white , slightly fluid gel .
The chemical name for ciclopirox is 6 - cyclohexyl - 1 - hydroxy - 4 - methyl - 2 ( 1 H ) - pyridinone , with the empirical formula C12H17NO2 and a molecular weight of 207 . 27 .
The CAS Registry Number is [ 29342 - 05 - 0 ] .
The chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Mechanism of Action : Ciclopirox acts by chelation of polyvalent cations ( Fe3 + or Al3 + ) resulting in the inhibition of the metal - dependent enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of peroxides within the fungal cell .
In vitro studies showed that ciclopirox inhibited the formation of 5 - lipoxygenase inflammatory mediators ( 5 - HETE and LTB4 ) and also inhibited PGE2 release in a cell culture model .
In vivo , ciclopirox inhibited inflammation in an arachidonic acid - induced murine ear edema model .
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown .
Pharmacokinetics : A comparative study of the pharmacokinetics of ciclopirox gel and ciclopirox cream ( ciclopirox olamine ) 0 . 77 % in 18 healthy males indicated that systemic absorption of ciclopirox from ciclopirox gel was higher than that of ciclopirox cream .
A 5 gm dose of ciclopirox gel produced a mean ( ± SD ) peak serum concentration of 25 . 02 ( ± 20 . 6 ) ng / mL total ciclopirox and 5 gm of ciclopirox cream produced 18 . 62 ( ± 13 . 56 ) ng / mL total ciclopirox .
Approximately 3 % of the applied ciclopirox was excreted in the urine within 48 hours after application , with a renal elimination half - life of about 5 . 5 hours .
In a study of ciclopirox gel , 16 men with moderate to severe tinea cruris applied approximately 15 grams / day of the gel for 14 . 5 days .
The mean ( ± SD ) dose - normalized values of Cmax for total ciclopirox in serum were 100 ( ± 42 ) ng / mL on day 1 and 238 ( ± 144 ) ng / mL on Day 15 .
During the 10 hours after dosing on Day 1 , approximately 10 % of the administered dose was excreted in the urine .

Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : A carcinogenicity study of ciclopirox ( 1 % and 5 % solutions in polyethylene glycol 400 ) in female mice dosed cutaneously twice per week for 50 weeks followed by a 6 - month drug - free observation period prior to necropsy revealed no evidence of tumors at the application site .
The following battery of in vitro genotoxicity tests was conducted with ciclopirox : evaluation of gene mutation in the Ames Salmonella and E . coli assays ( negative ) ; chromosome aberration assays in V79 Chinese hamster cells , with and without metabolic activation ( positive ) ; gene mutation assays in the in the HGPRT - test with V79 Chinese hamster cells ( negative ) ; and a primary DNA damage assay ( i . e . , unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in A549 human cells ) ( negative ) .
An in vitro cell transformation assay in BALB / c 3T3 cells was negative for cell transformation .
In an in vivo Chinese hamster bone marrow cytogenetic assay , ciclopirox was negative for chromosome aberrations at 5000 mg / kg .
Pregnancy - Teratogenic effects : Pregnancy Category B . Reproduction studies of ciclopirox revealed no significant evidence of impaired fertility in rats exposed orally up to 5 mg / kg body weight ( approximately 5 times the maximum recommended topical human dose based on surface area ) .
