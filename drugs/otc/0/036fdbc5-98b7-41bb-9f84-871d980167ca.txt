Table 2 Clinical Study of Colesevelam Hydrochloride for Primary Hyperlipidemia in HeFH Pediatric Patients : Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥ 2 % of Patients and More Commonly than in Placebo Colesevelam Hydrochloride Placebo N = 129 N = 65 Nasopharyngitis 6 . 2 % 4 . 6 % Headache 3 . 9 % 3 . 1 % Fatigue 3 . 9 % 1 . 5 % Creatine Phosphokinase Increase 2 . 3 % 0 . 0 % Rhinitis 2 . 3 % 0 . 0 % Vomiting 2 . 3 % 1 . 5 % The reported adverse reactions during the additional 18 - week open - label treatment period with colesevelam hydrochloride 3 . 8 g per day were similar to those during the double - blind period and included headache ( 7 . 6 % ) , nasopharyngitis ( 5 . 4 % ) , upper respiratory tract infection ( 4 . 9 % ) , influenza ( 3 . 8 % ) , and nausea ( 3 . 8 % ) .
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In 5 add - on combination and 1 monotherapy double - blind , 12 - to 26 - week , placebo - controlled clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , 1022 patients were treated with colesevelam hydrochloride .
The mean exposure duration was 20 weeks ( total exposure 393 patient - years ) .
Patients were to receive 3 . 8 grams of colesevelam hydrochloride per day .
The mean age of patients was 55 . 7 years , 52 . 8 percent of the population was male and 61 . 9 % were Caucasian , 4 . 8 % were Asian , and 15 . 9 % were Black or African American .
At baseline the population had a mean hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) of 8 . 2 % , and 26 % had past medical history suggestive of microvascular complications of diabetes .
Table 3 shows adverse reactions associated with the use of colesevelam hydrochloride in patients with type 2 diabetes .
These adverse reactions were not present at baseline , occurred more commonly on colesevelam hydrochloride than on placebo , and occurred in at least 2 % of patients treated with colesevelam hydrochloride .
Table 3 Clinical Studies of Colesevelam Hydrochloride for Type 2 Diabetes : Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥ 2 % of Patients and More Commonly than in Placebo Colesevelam Hydrochloride Placebo N = 1022 N = 1010 Constipation 6 . 5 % 2 . 2 % Hypoglycemia 3 . 4 % 3 . 1 % Dyspepsia 2 . 8 % 1 . 0 % Nausea 2 . 6 % 1 . 6 % Hypertension 2 . 6 % 1 . 9 % Back Pain 2 . 3 % 1 . 3 % A total of 5 . 3 % of colesevelam hydrochloride - treated patients and 3 . 6 % of placebo - treated patients were discontinued from the diabetes trials due to adverse reactions .
This difference was driven mostly by gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as abdominal pain and constipation .
One patient in the add - on to sulfonylurea trial discontinued due to body rash and mouth blistering that occurred on the first day of dosing of colesevelam hydrochloride , which may represent a hypersensitivity reaction to colesevelam hydrochloride .
Hypertriglyceridemia Patients with fasting serum TG levels above 500 mg / dL were excluded from the diabetes clinical trials .
In the diabetes trials , 1292 ( 67 . 7 % ) patients had baseline fasting serum TG levels less than 200 mg / dL , 426 ( 22 . 3 % ) had baseline fasting serum TG levels between 200 and less than 300 mg / dL , 175 ( 9 . 2 % ) had baseline fasting serum TG levels between 300 and 500 mg / dL , and 16 ( 0 . 8 % ) had fasting serum TG levels greater than or equal to 500 mg / dL .
The median baseline fasting TG concentration for the study population was 160 mg / dL ; the median post - treatment fasting TG was 180 mg / dL in the colesevelam hydrochloride group and 162 mg / dL in the placebo group .
Colesevelam hydrochloride therapy resulted in a median placebo - corrected increase in serum TG of 9 . 7 % ( p = 0 . 03 ) in the monotherapy study and of 5 % ( p = 0 . 22 ) , 11 % ( p < 0 . 001 ) , 18 % ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and 22 % ( p < 0 . 001 ) , when added to metformin , pioglitazone , sulfonylureas , and insulin , respectively .
In comparison , colesevelam hydrochloride resulted in a median increase in serum TG of 5 % compared to placebo ( p = 0 . 42 ) in a 24 - week monotherapy lipid - lowering trial .
Fasting TG concentrations ≥ 500 mg / dL occurred in 0 . 9 % of colesevelam hydrochloride - treated patients compared to 0 . 7 % of placebo - treated patients in the diabetes trials .
Among these patients , the TG concentrations with colesevelam hydrochloride ( median 606 mg / dL ; interquartile range 570 - 794 mg / dL ) were similar to that observed with placebo ( median 663 mg / dL ; interquartile range 542 - 984 mg / dL ) .
Five ( 0 . 6 % ) patients on colesevelam hydrochloride and 3 ( 0 . 3 % ) patients on placebo developed TG elevations ≥ 1000 mg / dL .
Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions During the diabetes trials , the incidence of patients with serious adverse reactions involving the cardiovascular system was 2 . 2 % ( 22 / 1022 ) in the colesevelam hydrochloride group and 1 % ( 10 / 1010 ) in the placebo group .
These overall rates included disparate events ( e . g . , myocardial infarction , aortic stenosis , and bradycardia ) ; therefore , the significance of this imbalance is unknown .
6 . 2 Post - marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of colesevelam hydrochloride .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Primary Hyperlipidemia : Colesevelam hydrochloride , the active pharmaceutical ingredient , is a non - absorbed , lipid - lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine , impeding their reabsorption .
As the bile acid pool becomes depleted , the hepatic enzyme , cholesterol 7 - α - hydroxylase , is upregulated , which increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids .
This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells , resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme , HMG - CoA reductase , and increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors .
These compensatory effects result in increased clearance of LDL - C from the blood , resulting in decreased serum LDL - C levels .
Serum TG levels may increase or remain unchanged .
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus : The mechanism by which colesevelam hydrochloride improves glycemic control is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics A maximum therapeutic response to the lipid - lowering effects of colesevelam hydrochloride was achieved within 2 weeks and was maintained during long - term therapy .
In the diabetes clinical studies , a therapeutic response to colesevelam hydrochloride , as reflected by a reduction in HbA1c , was initially noted following 4 - 6 weeks of treatment and reached maximal or near - maximal effect after 12 - 18 weeks of treatment .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Colesevelam hydrochloride is a hydrophilic , water - insoluble polymer that is not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes and is not absorbed .
Distribution Colesevelam hydrochloride is not absorbed , and therefore , its distribution is limited to the gastrointestinal tract .
Elimination Metabolism Colesevelam hydrochloride is not metabolized systemically and does not interfere with systemic drug - metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 .
Excretion In 16 healthy volunteers , an average of 0 . 05 % of administered radioactivity from a single 14 C - labeled colesevelam hydrochloride dose was excreted in the urine .
Drug Interaction Studies Drug interactions between colesevelam and concomitantly administered drugs were screened through in vitro studies and confirmed in in vivo studies .
In vitro studies demonstrated that cephalexin , metformin , and ciprofloxacin had negligible binding to colesevelam hydrochloride .
Therefore , an in vivo pharmacokinetic interaction of colesevelam hydrochloride with these drugs is unlikely .
Colesevelam hydrochloride was found to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of aspirin , atenolol , digoxin , enalapril , fenofibrate , lovastatin , metoprolol , phenytoin , pioglitazone , quinidine , rosiglitazone , sitagliptin , valproic acid , and warfarin .
The results of additional in vivo drug interactions of colesevelam hydrochloride are presented in Table 6 .

This dose was approximately 50 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 . 5 g / day , based on body weight , mg / kg .
There were no significant drug - induced tumor findings in male or female mice .
In a 104 - week carcinogenicity study with colesevelam hydrochloride in Harlan Sprague - Dawley rats , a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell adenoma was seen in male rats at doses > 1 . 2 g / kg / day ( approximately 20 times the maximum human dose , based on body weight , mg / kg ) ( trend test only ) .
A statistically significant increase in thyroid C - cell adenoma was seen in female rats at 2 . 4 g / kg / day ( approximately 40 times the maximum human dose , based on body weight , mg / kg ) .
Mutagenesis Colesevelam hydrochloride and 4 degradants present in the drug substance have been evaluated for mutagenicity in the Ames test and a mammalian chromosomal aberration test .
The 4 degradants and an extract of the parent compound did not exhibit genetic toxicity in an in vitro bacterial mutagenesis assay in S . typhimurium and E . coli ( Ames assay ) with or without rat liver metabolic activation .
An extract of the parent compound was positive in the Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cell chromosomal aberration assay in the presence of metabolic activation and negative in the absence of metabolic activation .
The results of the CHO cell chromosomal aberration assay with 2 of the 4 degradants , decylamine HCl and aminohexyltrimethyl ammonium chloride HCl , were equivocal in the absence of metabolic activation and negative in the presence of metabolic activation .
The other 2 degradants , didecylamine HCl and 6 - decylamino - hexyltrimethyl ammonium chloride HCl , were negative in the presence and absence of metabolic activation .
Impairment of Fertility Colesevelam hydrochloride did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 3 g / kg / day ( approximately 50 times the maximum human dose , based on body weight , mg / kg ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Reproductive Toxicology Studies Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 3 g / kg / day and 1 g / kg / day , respectively ( approximately 50 and 17 times the maximum human dose , based on body weight , mg / kg ) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to colesevelam hydrochloride .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Primary Hyperlipidemia Colesevelam hydrochloride reduces total cholesterol ( TC ) , LDL - C , apolipoprotein B ( Apo B ) , and non - high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( non - HDL - C ) when administered alone or in combination with a statin in patients with primary hyperlipidemia .
Approximately 1600 patients were studied in 9 clinical trials with treatment durations ranging from 4 to 50 weeks .
With the exception of one open - label , uncontrolled , long - term extension study , all studies were multicenter , randomized , double - blind , and placebo - controlled .
A maximum therapeutic response to colesevelam hydrochloride was achieved within 2 weeks and was maintained during long - term therapy .
Monotherapy In a study in patients with LDL - C between 130 mg / dL and 220 mg / dL ( mean 158 mg / dL ) , colesevelam hydrochloride was given for 24 weeks in divided doses with the morning and evening meals .
As shown in Table 7 , the mean LDL - C reductions were 15 % and 18 % at the 3 . 8 g and 4 . 5 g doses .
The respective mean TC reductions were 7 % and 10 % .
The mean Apo B reductions were 12 % in both treatment groups .
Colesevelam hydrochloride at both doses increased HDL - C by 3 % .
Increases in TG of 9 - 10 % were observed at both colesevelam hydrochloride doses , but the changes were not statistically different from placebo .

The mean LDL - C reductions were 18 % , 15 % , and 18 % for the 3 dosing regimens , respectively .
The reductions with these 3 regimens were not statistically different from one another .
Combination Therapy Co - administration of colesevelam hydrochloride and a statin ( atorvastatin , lovastatin , or simvastatin ) in 3 clinical studies demonstrated an additive reduction of LDL - C .
The mean baseline LDL - C was 184 mg / dL in the atorvastatin study ( range 156 - 236 mg / dL ) , 171 mg / dL in the lovastatin study ( range 115 - 247 mg / dL ) , and 188 mg / dL in the simvastatin study ( range 148 - 352 mg / dL ) .
As demonstrated in Table 8 , colesevelam hydrochloride doses of 2 . 3 g to 3 . 8 g resulted in an additional 8 % to 16 % reduction in LDL - C above that seen with the statin alone .

The LDL - C reduction with atorvastatin 80 mg was not statistically significantly different from the combination of colesevelam hydrochloride 3 . 8 g and atorvastatin 10 mg .
Pediatric Therapy The safety and efficacy of colesevelam hydrochloride in pediatric patients were evaluated in an 8 - week , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel - group study followed by an open - label phase , in 194 boys and postmenarchal girls 10 - 17 years of age ( mean age 14 . 1 years ) with HeFH , taking a stable dose of an FDA - approved statin ( with LDL - C > 130 mg / dL ) or naïve to lipid - lowering therapy ( with LDL - C > 160 mg / dL ) .
This study had 3 periods : a single - blind , placebo stabilization period ; an 8 - week , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group , placebo - controlled treatment period ; and an 18 - week , open - label treatment period .
Forty - seven ( 24 % ) patients were taking statins and 147 ( 76 % ) patients were statin - naïve at screening .
The mean baseline LDL - C at Day 1 was approximately 199 mg / dL .
During the double - blind treatment period , patients were assigned randomly to treatment : colesevelam hydrochloride 3 . 8 g / day ( n = 64 ) , colesevelam hydrochloride 1 . 9 g / day ( n = 65 ) , or placebo ( n = 65 ) .
In total , 186 patients completed the double - blind treatment period .
After 8 weeks of treatment , colesevelam hydrochloride 3 . 8 g / day significantly decreased plasma levels of LDL - C , non - HDL - C , TC , and Apo B and significantly increased HDL - C .
A moderate , non - statistically significant increase in TG was observed versus placebo ( Table 9 ) .

Results at Week 26 were consistent with those at Week 8 .
14 . 2 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Colesevelam hydrochloride has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin , pioglitazone , sulfonylureas , and insulin .
In these studies , colesevelam hydrochloride and placebo were administered either as 3 tablets twice daily with lunch and dinner or as 6 tablets with dinner alone .
Monotherapy The efficacy of colesevelam hydrochloride 3 . 8 g / day as anti - diabetes monotherapy was evaluated in a randomized double - blind , placebo - controlled trial involving 357 patients ( 176 colesevelam hydrochloride and 181 placebo ) with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were treatment - naïve or had not received antihyperglycemic medication within 3 months prior to the start of the study .
Statin use at baseline was reported in 13 % of the colesevelam hydrochloride - treated patients and 16 % of the placebo - treated patients .
Colesevelam hydrochloride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c of 0 . 27 % compared to placebo ( Table 10 ) .
The mean baseline LDL - C was 121 mg / dL in the monotherapy trial .
Colesevelam hydrochloride treatment resulted in a placebo - corrected 11 % reduction in LDL - C .
Colesevelam hydrochloride treatment also reduced serum TC , ApoB , and non - HDL - C ( Table 11 ) .
The mean change in body weight was - 0 . 6 kg for colesevelam hydrochloride and - 0 . 7 kg for placebo treatment groups .

Add - on Combination Therapy The efficacy of colesevelam hydrochloride 3 . 8 g / day in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in 5 double - blind , placebo - controlled add - on therapy trials involving a total of 1691 patients with baseline HbA1c 7 . 5 - 9 . 5 % .
Patients were enrolled and maintained on their pre - existing , stable , background anti - diabetic regimen .
Statin use at baseline was reported in 41 % of the colesevelam hydrochloride - treated patients and 48 % of the placebo - treated patients .
In 3 add - on combination therapy trials ( metformin , sulfonylurea and insulin ) , treatment with colesevelam hydrochloride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c of 0 . 5 % compared to placebo .
Similar placebo - corrected reductions in HbA1c occurred in patients who received colesevelam hydrochloride in combination with metformin , sulfonylurea , or insulin monotherapy or combinations of these therapies with other anti - diabetic agents .
In the pioglitazone trial , treatment with colesevelam hydrochloride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c of 0 . 32 % compared to placebo .
In the metformin , pioglitazone , and sulfonylurea trials , treatment with colesevelam hydrochloride also resulted in statistically significant reductions in FPG of at least 14 mg / dL compared to placebo .
Colesevelam hydrochloride had consistent effects on HbA1c across subgroups of age , gender , race , body mass index , and baseline HbA1c .
Colesevelam hydrochloride ' s effects on HbA1c were also similar for the two dosing regimens ( 3 tablets with lunch and with dinner or 6 tablets with dinner alone ) .
The mean baseline LDL - C was 104 mg / dL in the metformin study ( range 32 - 214 mg / dL ) , 107 mg / dL in the pioglitazone study ( range 48 - 263 mg / dL ) , 106 mg / dL in the sulfonylurea study ( range 41 - 264 mg / dL ) , 102 mg / dL in the insulin study ( range 35 - 204 mg / dL ) .
In these trials , colesevelam hydrochloride treatment was associated with a 12 % to 16 % reduction in LDL - C levels .
The percentage decreases in LDL - C were of similar magnitude to those observed in patients with primary hyperlipidemia .
Colesevelam hydrochloride treatment was associated with statistically significant increases in TG levels in the studies of patients on insulin , patients on a sulfonylurea , and patients on pioglitazone but not in the study of patients on metformin .
The clinical significance of these increases is unknown .
Colesevelam hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with TG levels > 500 mg / dL [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] , and periodic monitoring of lipid parameters including TG is recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Body weight did not significantly increase from baseline with colesevelam hydrochloride therapy , compared with placebo , in any of the add - on combination diabetes studies .
Add - on Combination Therapy with Metformin Colesevelam hydrochloride 3 . 8 g / day or placebo was added to background anti - diabetic therapy in a 26 - week trial of 316 patients already receiving treatment with metformin alone ( N = 159 ) or metformin in combination with other oral agents ( N = 157 ) .
A total of 60 % of these patients were receiving ≥ 1 , 500 mg / day of metformin .
In combination with metformin , colesevelam hydrochloride resulted in statistically significant placebo - corrected reductions in HbA1c and FPG ( Table 12 ) .
Colesevelam hydrochloride also reduced TC , LDL - C , Apo B , and non - HDL - C ( Table 13 ) .
The mean percent change in serum LDL - C levels with colesevelam hydrochloride compared to placebo was - 16 % among statin users and statin non - users ; the median percent change in serum TG levels with colesevelam hydrochloride compared to placebo was - 2 % among statin users and 10 % among statin non - users .
The mean change in body weight was - 0 . 5 kg for colesevelam hydrochloride and - 0 . 3 kg for placebo .

Add - on Combination Therapy with Insulin Colesevelam hydrochloride 3 . 8 g / day or placebo was added to background anti - diabetic therapy in a 16 - week trial of 287 patients already treated with insulin alone ( N = 116 ) or insulin in combination with oral agents ( N = 171 ) .
At baseline , the median daily insulin dose was 70 units in the colesevelam hydrochloride group and 65 units in the placebo group .
In combination with insulin , colesevelam hydrochloride resulted in a statistically significant placebo - corrected reduction in HbA1c ( Table 18 ) .
Colesevelam hydrochloride also reduced LDL - C and Apo B , but increased serum TG ( Table 19 ) .
The mean percent change in serum LDL - C levels with colesevelam hydrochloride compared to placebo was - 13 % among statin users and statin non - users ; the median percent increase in serum TG levels with colesevelam hydrochloride compared to placebo was 24 % among statin users and 17 % among statin non - users .
The mean change in body weight was 0 . 6 kg for colesevelam hydrochloride and 0 . 2 kg for placebo .
