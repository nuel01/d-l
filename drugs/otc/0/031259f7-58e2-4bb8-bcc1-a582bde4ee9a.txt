[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The exact mechanism by which erythromycin reduces lesions of acne vulgaris is not fully known ; however , the effect appears to be due in part to the antibacterial activity of the drug .
Benzoyl peroxide has a keratolytic and desquamative effect which may also contribute to its efficacy .
Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid .
MICROBIOLOGY Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by reversibly binding to 50 S ribosomal subunits , thereby inhibiting translocation of aminoacyl transfer - RNA and inhibiting polypeptide synthesis .
Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between erythromycin , lincomycin , chloramphenicol and clindamycin .
Benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial agent which has been shown to be effective against Propionibacterium acnes , an anaerobe found in sebaceous follicles and comedones .
The antibacterial action of benzoyl peroxide is believed to be due to the release of active oxygen .

CONTRAINDICATIONS Erythromycin - Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel is contraindicated in those individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components .
WARNINGS Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents , including erythromycin , and may range in severity from mild to life - threatening .
Therefore , it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia .
Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is one primary cause of " antibiotic - associated colitis . "
After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established , therapeutic measures should be initiated .
Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone .
In moderate to severe cases , consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes , protein supplementation and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against C . difficile colitis .
PRECAUTIONS GeneralFor topical use only ; not for ophthalmic use .
Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur , especially with the use of peeling , desquamating or abrasive agents .
If severe irritation develops , discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy .
The use of antibiotic agents may be associated with the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi .
If this occurs , discontinue use and take appropriate measures .
Avoid contact with eyes and all mucous membranes .
