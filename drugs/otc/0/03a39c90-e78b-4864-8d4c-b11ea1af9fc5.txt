DOBUTamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP Flexible Plastic Container [ MULTIMEDIA ] Rx only [ MULTIMEDIA ] DESCRIPTION Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , prediluted solution of dobutamine hydrochloride and dextrose in water for injection .
It is administered by intravenous infusion .
Each 100 mL contains dobutamine hydrochloride equivalent to 100 mg , 200 mg , or 400 mg of dobutamine ; dextrose ( derived from corn ) , hydrous 5 g in water for injection , with sodium metabisulfite 25 mg and edetate disodium , dihydrate 10 mg added as stabilizers ; osmolar concentration , respectively , 263 , 270 , or 284 mOsmol / liter ( calc . )
.
The pH is 3 . 0 ( 2 . 5 to 5 . 5 ) .
May contain hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment .
Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP is oxygen sensitive .
Dobutamine Hydrochloride , USP is chemically designated ( ± ) - 4 - [ 2 - [ [ 3 - ( p - hydroxyphenyl ) - 1 - methylpropyl ] amino ] ethyl ] - pyrocatechol hydrochloride .
It is a synthetic catecholamine .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Dextrose , USP is chemically designated D - glucose monohydrate ( C6H12O6 • H2O ) , a hexose sugar freely soluble in water .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H2O .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated CR3 plastic material .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts ; however , biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Dobutamine is a direct - acting inotropic agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the β - receptors of the heart while producing comparatively mild chronotropic , hypertensive , arrhythmogenic , and vasodilative effects .
It does not cause the release of endogenous norepinephrine , as does dopamine .
In animal studies , dobutamine produces less increase in heart rate and less decrease in peripheral vascular resistance for a given inotropic effect than does isoproterenol .
In patients with depressed cardiac function , both dobutamine and isoproterenol increase the cardiac output to a similar degree .
In the case of dobutamine , this increase is usually not accompanied by marked increases in heart rate ( although tachycardia is occasionally observed ) , and the cardiac stroke volume is usually increased .
In contrast , isoproterenol increases the cardiac index primarily by increasing the heart rate while stroke volume changes little or declines .
Facilitation of atrioventricular conduction has been observed in human electrophysiologic studies and in patients with atrial fibrillation .
Systemic vascular resistance is usually decreased with administration of dobutamine .
Occasionally , minimum vasoconstriction has been observed .
Most clinical experience with dobutamine is short - term , not more than several hours in duration .
In the limited number of patients who were studied for 24 , 48 , and 72 hours , a persistent increase in cardiac output occurred in some , whereas output returned toward baseline values in others .
The onset of action of Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP is within 1 to 2 minutes ; however , as much as 10 minutes may be required to obtain the peak effect of a particular infusion rate .
The plasma half - life of dobutamine in humans is 2 minutes .
The principal routes of metabolism are methylation of the catechol and conjugation .
In human urine , the major excretion products are the conjugates of dobutamine and 3 - O - methyl dobutamine .
The 3 - O - methyl derivative of dobutamine is inactive .
Alteration of synaptic concentrations of catecholamines with either reserpine or tricyclic antidepressants does not alter the actions of dobutamine in animals , which indicates that the actions of dobutamine are not dependent on presynaptic mechanisms .
The effective infusion rate of dobutamine varies widely from patient to patient , and titration is always necessary ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
At least in pediatric patients , dobutamine - induced increases in cardiac output and systemic pressure are generally seen , in any given patient , at lower infusion rates than those that cause substantial tachycardia ( See Pediatric Use under PRECAUTIONS ) .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP is indicated when parenteral therapy is necessary for inotropic support in the short - term treatment of patients with cardiac decompensation due to depressed contractility resulting either from organic heart disease or from cardiac surgical procedures .
Experience with intravenous dobutamine in controlled trials does not extend beyond 48 hours of repeated boluses and / or continuous infusions .
Whether given orally , continuously intravenously , or intermittently intravenously , neither dobutamine nor any other cyclic - AMP - dependent inotrope has been shown in controlled trials to be safe or effective in the long - term treatment of congestive heart failure .
In controlled trials of chronic oral therapy with various such agents , symptoms were not consistently alleviated , and the cyclic - AMP - dependent inotropes were consistently associated with increased risks of hospitalization and death .
Patients with NYHA Class IV symptoms appeared to be at particular risk .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP is contraindicated in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis and in patients who have shown previous manifestations of hypersensitivity to dobutamine or any of its components .
WARNINGS Increase in Heart Rate or Blood Pressure Dobutamine hydrochloride may cause a marked increase in heart rate or blood pressure , especially systolic pressure .
Approximately 10 % of adult patients in clinical studies have had rate increases of 30 beats / minute or more , and about 7 . 5 % have had a 50 - mm Hg or greater increase in systolic pressure .
Usually , reduction of dosage reverses these effects .
Because dobutamine facilitates atrioventricular conduction , patients with atrial fibrillation are at risk of developing rapid ventricular response .
In patients who have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response , a digitalis preparation should be used prior to institution of therapy with dobutamine .
Patients with pre - existing hypertension appear to face an increased risk of developing an exaggerated pressure response .
Ectopic Activity Dobutamine may precipitate or exacerbate ventricular ectopic activity , but it rarely has caused ventricular tachycardia .
Hypersensitivity Reactions suggestive of hypersensitivity associated with administration of Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP , including skin rash , fever , eosinophilia , and bronchospasm , have been reported occasionally .
Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP contains sodium bisulfite , a sulfite that may cause allergic - type reactions , including anaphylactic symptoms and life - threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes , in certain susceptible people .
The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low .
Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people .
PRECAUTIONS General During the administration of dobutamine , as with any adrenergic agent , ECG and blood pressure should be continuously monitored .
In addition , pulmonary wedge pressure and cardiac output should be monitored whenever possible to aid in the safe and effective infusion of Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP .
Hypovolemia should be corrected with suitable volume expanders before treatment with Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP is instituted .
Animal studies indicate that dobutamine may be ineffective if the patient has recently received a β - blocking drug .
In such a case , the peripheral vascular resistance may increase .
No improvement may be observed in the presence of marked mechanical obstruction , such as severe valvular aortic stenosis .
Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged .
Discard unused portion .
Usage Following Acute Myocardial Infarction : Clinical experience with dobutamine following myocardial infarction has been insufficient to establish the safety of the drug for this use .
There is concern that any agent that increases contractile force and heart rate may increase the size of an infarction by intensifying ischemia , but it is not known whether dobutamine does so .
Drug Interactions : There was no evidence of drug interactions in clinical studies in which dobutamine hydrochloride was administered concurrently with other drugs , including digitalis preparations , furosemide , spironolactone , lidocaine , glyceryl trinitrate , isosorbide dinitrate , morphine , atropine , heparin , protamine , potassium chloride , folic acid , and acetaminophen .
Preliminary studies indicate that the concomitant use of dobutamine and nitroprusside results in a higher cardiac output and , usually , a lower pulmonary wedge pressure than when either drug is used alone .
Concomitant use of dobutamine and catechol - O - methyltranferase ( COMT ) inhibitors ( e . g . , entacapone ) may result in increased heart rate , arrhythmias , and changes in blood pressure .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Studies to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of dobutamine or the potential of the drug to affect fertility adversely have not been performed .
Pregnancy : Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dobutamine .
The drug , however , has not been administered to pregnant women and should be used only when the expected benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus .
Pediatric Use : Dobutamine has been shown to increase cardiac output and systemic pressure in pediatric patients of every age group .
In premature neonates , however , dobutamine is less effective than dopamine in raising systemic blood pressure without causing undue tachycardia , and dobutamine has not been shown to provide any added benefit when given to such infants already receiving optimal infusions of dopamine .
Geriatric Use : Clinical studies of dobutamine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or drug therapy .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Increased Heart Rate , Blood Pressure , and Ventricular Ectopic Activity : A 10 - to 20 - mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure and an increase in heart rate of 5 to 15 beats / minute have been noted in most patients ( see WARNINGS regarding exaggerated chronotropic and pressor effects ) .
Approximately 5 % of adult patients have had increased premature ventricular beats during infusions .
These effects are dose related .
Hypotension : Precipitous decreases in blood pressure have occasionally been described in association with dobutamine therapy .
Decreasing the dose or discontinuing the infusion typically results in rapid return of blood pressure to baseline values .
In rare cases , however , intervention may be required and reversibility may not be immediate .
Reactions at Sites of Intravenous Infusion : Phlebitis has occasionally been reported .
Local inflammatory changes have been described following inadvertent infiltration .
Miscellaneous Uncommon Effects : The following adverse effects have been reported in 1 % to 3 % of adult patients : nausea , headache , anginal pain , nonspecific chest pain , palpitations , and shortness of breath .
Administration of dobutamine , like other catecholamines , has been associated with decreases in serum potassium concentrations , rarely to hypokalemic values .
OVERDOSAGE Overdoses of dobutamine have been reported rarely .
The following is provided to serve as a guide if such an overdose is encountered .
Signs and Symptoms : Toxicity from dobutamine hydrochloride is usually due to excessive cardiac β - receptor stimulation .
The duration of action of dobutamine hydrochloride is generally short ( T ½ = 2 minutes ) because it is rapidly metabolized by catechol - O - methyltransferase .
The symptoms of toxicity may include anorexia , nausea , vomiting , tremor , anxiety , palpitations , headache , shortness of breath , and anginal and nonspecific chest pain .
The positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of dobutamine on the myocardium may cause hypertension , tachyarrhythmias , myocardial ischemia , and ventricular fibrillation .
Hypotension may result from vasodilation .
If the product is ingested , unpredictable absorption may occur from the mouth and the gastrointestinal tract .
Treatment : To obtain up - to - date information about the treatment of overdose , a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center .
Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians ' Desk Reference ( PDR ) .
In managing overdosage , consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses , interaction among drugs , and unusual drug kinetics in your patient .
The initial actions to be taken in a dobutamine hydrochloride overdose are discontinuing administration , establishing an airway , and ensuring oxygenation and ventilation .
Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly .
Severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias may be successfully treated with propranolol or lidocaine .
Hypertension usually responds to a reduction in dose or discontinuation of therapy .
Protect the patient ' s airway and support ventilation and perfusion .
If needed , meticulously monitor and maintain , within acceptable limits , the patient ' s vital signs , blood gases , serum electrolytes , etc .
Absorption of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal , which , in many cases , is more effective than emesis or lavage ; consider charcoal instead of or in addition to gastric emptying .
Repeated doses of charcoal over time may hasten elimination of some drugs that have been absorbed .
Safeguard the patient ' s airway when employing gastric emptying or charcoal .
Forced diuresis , peritoneal dialysis , hemodialysis , or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for an overdose of dobutamine hydrochloride .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dosage Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP is administered intravenously through a suitable intravenous catheter or needle .
A calibrated electronic infusion device is recommended for controlling the rate of flow in mL / hour or drops / minute .
Infusion of dobutamine should be started at a low rate ( 0 . 5 to 1 . 0 µg / kg / min ) and titrated at intervals of a few minutes , guided by the patient ' s response , including systemic blood pressure , urine flow , frequency of ectopic activity , heart rate , and ( whenever possible ) measurements of cardiac output , central venous pressure , and / or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure .
In reported trials , the optimal infusion rates have varied from patient to patient , usually 2 to 20 µg / kg / min but sometimes slightly outside of this range .
On rare occasions , infusion rates up to 40 µg / kg / min have been required to obtain the desired effect .
Rates of infusion in mL / hour for dobutamine hydrochloride concentrations of 500 , 1 , 000 , 2 , 000 and 4 , 000 mg / L may be calculated using the following formula : Infusion Rate ( mL / h ) = [ Dose ( µg / kg / min ) x Weight ( kg ) x 60 min / h ] Final Concentration ( µg / mL ) Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows : Example 1 : for a 60 kg person at an initial dose of 0 . 5 µg / kg / min using a 500 µg / mL concentration , the infusion rate would be as follows : Infusion Rate ( mL / h ) = [ 0 . 5 ( µg / kg / min ) x 60 ( kg ) x 60 ( min / h ) ] = 3 . 6 ( mL / h ) 500 ( µg / mL ) Example 2 : for a 80 kg person at a dose of 10 µg / kg / min using a 2 , 000 µg / mL concentration , the infusion rate would be as follows : Infusion Rate ( mL / h ) = [ 10 ( µg / kg / min ) x 80 ( kg ) x 60 ( min / h ) ] = 24 ( mL / h ) 2 , 000 ( µg / mL ) This container system may be inappropriate for the dosage requirements of pediatric patients under 30 kg .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP solutions may exhibit a pink color that , if present , will increase with time .
This color change is due to slight oxidation of the drug , but there is no significant loss of potency .
Solutions containing dextrose should not be administered through the same administration set as blood , as this may result in pseudoagglutination or hemolysis .
Do not add supplementary medications to Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP .
Do not administer Dobutamine in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP simultaneously with solutions containing sodium bicarbonate or strong alkaline solutions .
