Apnea , bradycardia , coma , hypotension , hypothermia , hypotonia , lethargy , pallor , respiratory depression , and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Antihypertensives / cardiac glycosides may lower blood pressure .
( 7 . 1 ) • Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect .
( 7 . 2 ) • Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine .
( 7 . 3 ) • Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension .
( 7 . 4 ) 7 . 1 Antihypertensives / Cardiac Glycosides Because ALPHAGAN ® P may reduce blood pressure , caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and / or cardiac glycosides with ALPHAGAN ® P is advised .
7 . 2 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ALPHAGAN ® P , the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants ( alcohol , barbiturates , opiates , sedatives , or anesthetics ) should be considered .
7 . 3 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine .
It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with ALPHAGAN ® P in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP lowering effect .
Caution is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines .
7 . 4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side - effect such as hypotension .
Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Use with caution in children ≥ 2 years of age .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B : Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals .
Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits .
The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats ( 2 . 5 mg / kg / day ) and rabbits ( 5 . 0 mg / kg / day ) achieved AUC exposure values 360 - and 20 - fold higher , or 260 - and 15 - fold higher , respectively , than similar values estimated in humans treated with ALPHAGAN ® P 0 . 1 % or 0 . 15 % , 1 drop in both eyes three times daily .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women ; however , in animal studies , brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , ALPHAGAN ® P should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk , although in animal studies , brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from ALPHAGAN ® P in nursing infants , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use ALPHAGAN ® P is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS , 4 . 1 ) .
During postmarketing surveillance , apnea , bradycardia , coma , hypotension , hypothermia , hypotonia , lethargy , pallor , respiratory depression , and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine .
The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years .
In a well - controlled clinical study conducted in pediatric glaucoma patients ( ages 2 to 7 years ) the most commonly observed adverse reactions with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0 . 2 % dosed three times daily were somnolence ( 50 - 83 % in patients ages 2 to 6 years ) and decreased alertness .
In pediatric patients 7 years of age ( > 20 kg ) , somnolence appears to occur less frequently ( 25 % ) .
Approximately 16 % of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution discontinued from the study due to somnolence .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients .
8 . 6 Special Populations ALPHAGAN ® P has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment .
ALPHAGAN ® P has not been studied in patients with renal impairment .
The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known .
10 OVERDOSAGE Very limited information exists on accidental ingestion of brimonidine in adults ; the only adverse reaction reported to date has been hypotension .
Symptoms of brimonidine overdose have been reported in neonates , infants , and children receiving ALPHAGAN ® P as part of medical treatment of congenital glaucoma or by accidental oral ingestion ( see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS , 8 . 4 ) .
Treatment of an oral overdose includes supportive and symptomatic therapy ; a patent airway should be maintained .
11 DESCRIPTION ALPHAGAN ® P ( brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 1 % or 0 . 15 % , sterile , is a relatively selective alpha - 2 adrenergic receptor agonist ( topical intraocular pressure lowering agent ) .
The structural formula of brimonidine tartrate is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] 5 - Bromo - 6 - ( 2 - imidazolidinylideneamino ) quinoxaline L - tartrate ; MW = 442 . 24 In solution , ALPHAGAN ® P ( brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution ) has a clear , greenish - yellow color .
It has an osmolality of 250 - 350 mOsmol / kg and a pH of 7 . 4 - 8 . 0 ( 0 . 1 % ) or 6 . 9 - 7 . 4 ( 0 . 15 % ) .
Brimonidine tartrate appears as an off - white to pale - yellow powder and is soluble in both water ( 0 . 6 mg / mL ) and in the product vehicle ( 1 . 4 mg / mL ) at pH 7 . 7 .
Each mL of ALPHAGAN ® P contains the active ingredient brimonidine tartrate 0 . 1 % ( 1 mg / mL ) or 0 . 15 % ( 1 . 5 mg / mL ) with the inactive ingredients sodium carboxymethylcellulose ; sodium borate ; boric acid ; sodium chloride ; potassium chloride ; calcium chloride ; magnesium chloride ; PURITE ® 0 . 005 % ( 0 . 05 mg / mL ) as a preservative ; purified water ; and hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide to adjust pH . [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action ALPHAGAN ® P is a relatively selective alpha - 2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post - dosing .
Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After ocular administration of either a 0 . 1 % or 0 . 2 % solution , plasma concentrations peaked within 0 . 5 to 2 . 5 hours and declined with a systemic half - life of approximately 2 hours .
Distribution The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied .
Metabolism In humans , brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver .
Excretion Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites .
Approximately 87 % of an orally - administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours , with 74 % found in the urine .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No compound - related carcinogenic effects were observed in either mice or rats following a 21 - month and 24 - month study , respectively .
In these studies , dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2 . 5 mg / kg / day in mice and 1 mg / kg / day in rats achieved 150 and 120 times or 90 and 80 times , respectively , the plasma Cmax drug concentration in humans treated with one drop of ALPHAGAN ® P 0 . 1 % or 0 . 15 % into both eyes 3 times per day , the recommended daily human dose .
Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test , chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells , and three in vivo studies in CD - 1 mice : a host - mediated assay , cytogenetic study , and dominant lethal assay .
Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses which achieve up to approximately 125 and 90 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of ALPHAGAN ® P 0 . 1 % or 0 . 15 % , respectively .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Elevated IOP presents a major risk factor in glaucomatous field loss .
The higher the level of IOP , the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss .
Brimonidine tartrate has the action of lowering intraocular pressure with minimal effect on cardiovascular and pulmonary parameters .
Clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the safety , efficacy , and acceptability of ALPHAGAN ® P ( brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 15 % compared with ALPHAGAN ® administered three - times - daily in patients with open - angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension .
Those results indicated that ALPHAGAN ® P ( brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 15 % is comparable in IOP lowering effect to ALPHAGAN ® ( brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 2 % , and effectively lowers IOP in patients with open - angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension by approximately 2 - 6 mmHg .
A clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety , efficacy , and acceptability of ALPHAGAN ® P ( brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 1 % compared with ALPHAGAN ® administered three - times - daily in patients with open - angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension .
Those results indicated that ALPHAGAN ® P ( brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 1 % is equivalent in IOP lowering effect to ALPHAGAN ® ( brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 2 % , and effectively lowers IOP in patients with open - angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension by approximately 2 - 6 mmHg .
