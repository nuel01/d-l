DESCRIPTION This preparation is designed solely for parenteral use only after addition to drugs that require dilution or must be dissolved in an aqueous vehicle prior to injection .
Sterile Water for Injection , USP is a sterile , nonpyrogenic preparation of water for injection which contains no bacteriostat , antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is supplied only in single dose containers to dilute or dissolve drugs for injection .
For IV injection , add sufficient amount to a solute to make an approximately isotonic solution .
pH 5 . 0 to 7 . 0 .
Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H 2 O .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters ( 1 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms .
Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium ( Na + ) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium .
The small volume of fluid provided by Sterile Water for Injection , USP when used only as a pharmaceutic aid for diluting or dissolving drugs for parenteral injection , is unlikely to exert a significant effect on fluid balance except possibly in neonates or very small infants .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE This parenteral preparation is indicated only for diluting or dissolving drugs for intravenous , intramuscular or subcutaneous injection , according to instructions of the manufacturer of the drug to be administered .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Sterile Water for Injection must be made approximately isotonic prior to use .
WARNINGS Intravenous administration of Sterile Water for Injection without a solute may result in hemolysis .
PRECAUTIONS Do not use for intravenous injection unless the osmolar concentration of additives results in an approximate isotonic admixture .
Consult the manufacturer ’ s instructions for choice of vehicle , appropriate dilution or volume for dissolving the drugs to be injected , including the route and rate of injection .
Inspect reconstituted ( diluted or dissolved ) drugs for clarity ( if soluble ) and freedom from unexpected precipitation or discoloration prior to administration .
Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sterile Water for Injection .
It is also not known whether sterile water containing additives can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Sterile Water for Injection with additives should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have been established in pediatric patients .
However , in neonates or very small infants the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance .
Drug Interactions Some drugs for injection may be incompatible in a given vehicle , or when combined in the same vehicle or in a vehicle containing benzyl alcohol .
Consult with pharmacist , if available .
Use aseptic technique for single or multiple entry and withdrawal from all containers .
When diluting or dissolving drugs , mix thoroughly and use promptly .
Do not store reconstituted solutions of drugs for injection unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer of the solute .
Do not use unless the solution is clear and seal intact .
Do not reuse single - dose containers .
Discard unused portion .
ADVERSE REACTIONS To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Fresenius Kabi USA , LLC at 1 - 800 - 551 - 7176 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
Reactions which may occur because of this solution , added drugs or the technique of reconstitution or administration include febrile response , local tenderness , abscess , tissue necrosis or infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection and extravasation .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate countermeasures , and if possible , retrieve and save the remainder of the unused vehicle for examination .
OVERDOSAGE Use only as a diluent or solvent .
This parenteral preparation is unlikely to pose a threat of fluid overload except possibly in neonates or very small infants .
In the event these should occur , re - evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures ( see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONSand ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The volume of the preparation to be used for diluting or dissolving any drug for injection is dependent on the vehicle concentration , dose and route of administration as recommended by the manufacturer .
This parenteral should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
