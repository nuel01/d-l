to control emotional and somatic factors in gastrointestinal disorders DESCRIPTION Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide combines in a single capsule formulation the antianxiety action of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and the anticholinergic / spasmolytic effects of clidinium bromide , both exclusive developments of Roche research .
Each Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide capsule contains 5 mg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and 2 . 5 mg clidinium bromide .
Each capsule also contains corn starch , lactose and talc .
Gelatin capsule shells may contain methyl and propyl parabens and potassium sorbate , with the following dye systems : D & C Yellow No . 10 and either FD & C Blue No . 1 or FD & C Green No . 3 .
Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride is a versatile , therapeutic agent of proven value for the relief of anxiety and tension .
It is indicated when anxiety , tension or apprehension are significant components of the clinical profile .
It is among the safer of the effective psychopharmacologic compounds .
Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride is 7 - chloro - 2 - methylamino - 5 - phenyl - 3 H - 1 , 4 - benzodiazepine 4 - oxide hydrochloride .
A colorless , crystalline substance , it is soluble in water .
It is unstable in solution and the powder must be protected from light .
The molecular weight is 336 . 22 .
The structural formula of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clidinium bromide is a synthetic anticholinergic agent which has been shown in experimental and clinical studies to have a pronounced antispasmodic and antisecretory effect on the gastrointestinal tract .
Structurally clidinium bromide is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride has been studied extensively in many species of animals and these studies are suggestive of action on the limbic system of the brain , which recent evidence indicates is involved in emotional responses .
Hostile monkeys were made tame by oral drug doses which did not cause sedation .
Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride revealed a " taming " action with the elimination of fear and aggression .
The taming effect of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride was further demonstrated in rats made vicious by lesions in the septal area of the brain .
The drug dosage which effectively blocked the vicious reaction was well below the dose which caused sedation in these animals .
The oral LD50 of single doses of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride , calculated according to the method of Miller and Tainter , is 720 ± 51 mg / kg as determined in mice observed over a period of 5 days following dosage .
Clidinium bromide is an effective anticholinergic agent with activity approximating that of atropine sulfate against acetylcholine - induced spasms in isolated intestinal strips .
On oral administration in mice it proved an effective antisialagogue in preventing pilocarpine - induced salivation .
Spontaneous intestinal motility in both rats and dogs is reduced following oral dosing with 0 . 1 to 0 . 25 mg / kg .
Potent cholinergic ganglionic blocking effects ( vagal ) are produced with intravenous usage in anesthetized dogs .
Oral doses of 2 . 5 mg / kg to dogs produced signs of nasal dryness and slight pupillary dilation .
In two other species , monkeys and rabbits , doses of 5 mg / kg , po , given three times daily for 5 days did not produce apparent secretory or visual changes .
The oral LD50 of single doses of clidinium bromide is 860 ± 57 mg / kg as determined in mice observed over a period of 5 days following dosage ; the calculations were made according to the method of Miller and Tainter .
Effects on Reproduction Reproduction studies in rats fed chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride , 10 , 20 and 80 mg / kg daily , and bred through one or two matings showed no congenital anomalies , nor were there adverse effects on lactation of the dams or growth of the newborn .
However , in another study at 100 mg / kg daily there was noted a significant decrease in the fertilization rate and a marked decrease in the viability and body weight of offspring which may be attributable to sedative activity , thus resulting in lack of interest in mating and lessened maternal nursing and care of the young .
One neonate in each of the first and second matings in the rat reproduction study at the 100 mg / kg dose exhibited major skeletal defects .
Further studies are in progress to determine the significance of these findings .
Two series of reproduction experiments with clidinium bromide were carried out in rats , employing dosages of 2 . 5 and 10 mg / kg daily in each experiment .
In the first experiment clidinium bromide was administered for a 9 - week interval prior to mating ; no untoward effect on fertilization or gestation was noted .
The offspring were taken by caesarean section and did not show a significant incidence of congenital anomalies when compared to control animals .
In the second experiment adult animals were given clidinium bromide for 10 days prior to and through two mating cycles .
No significant effects were observed on fertility , gestation , viability of offspring or lactation , as compared to control animals , nor was there a significant incidence of congenital anomalies in the offspring derived from these experiments .
A reproduction study of Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide was carried out in rats through two successive matings .
Oral daily doses were administered in two concentrations : 2 . 5 mg / kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride with 1 . 25 mg / kg clidinium bromide or 25 mg / kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride with 12 . 5 mg / kg clidinium bromide .
In the first mating no significant differences were noted between the control or the treated groups , with the exception of a slight decrease in the number of animals surviving during lactation among those receiving the highest dosage .
As with all anticholinergic drugs , an inhibiting effect on lactation may occur .
In the second mating similar results were obtained except for a slight decrease in the number of pregnant females and in the percentage of offspring surviving until weaning .
No congenital anomalies were observed in both matings in either the control or treated groups .
Additional animal reproduction studies are in progress .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Based on a review of this drug by the National Academy of Sciences — National Research Council and / or other information , FDA has classified the indications as follows : " Possibly " effective : as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer and in the treatment of the irritable bowel syndrome ( irritable colon , spastic colon , mucous colitis ) and acute enterocolitis .
Final classification of the less - than - effective indications requires further investigation .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide is contraindicated in the presence of glaucoma ( since the anticholinergic component may produce some degree of mydriasis ) and in patients with prostatic hypertrophy and benign bladder neck obstruction .
It is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and / or clidinium bromide .
WARNINGS As in the case of other preparations containing CNS - acting drugs , patients receiving Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide should be cautioned about possible combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants .
For the same reason , they should be cautioned against hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle .
Usage in Pregnancy An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers ( chlordiazepoxide , diazepam and meprobamate ) during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies .
Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency , their use during this period should almost always be avoided .
The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered .
Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physicians about the desirability of discontinuing the drug .
As with all anticholinergic drugs , an inhibiting effect on lactation may occur ( see Animal Pharmacology ) .
OVERDOSAGE Manifestations of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride overdosage include somnolence , confusion , coma and diminished reflexes .
Respiration , pulse and blood pressure should be monitored , as in all cases of drug overdosage , although , in general , these effects have been minimal following chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride overdosage .
While the signs and symptoms of Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide overdosage may be produced by either of its components , usually such symptoms will be overshadowed by the anticholinergic actions of clidinium bromide .
The symptoms of overdosage of clidinium bromide are excessive dryness of mouth , blurring of vision , urinary hesitancy and constipation .
General supportive measures should be employed , along with immediate gastric lavage .
Administer physostigmine 0 . 5 to 2 mg at a rate of no more than 1 mg per minute .
This may be repeated in 1 to 4 mg doses if arrhythmias , convulsions or deep coma recur .
Intravenous fluids should be administered and an adequate airway maintained .
Hypotension may be combated by the use of levarterenol or metaraminol .
Methylphenidate or caffeine and sodium benzoate may be given to combat CNS - depressive effects .
Dialysis is of limited value .
Should excitation occur , barbiturates should not be used .
As with the management of intentional overdosage with any drug , it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been ingested .
Withdrawal symptoms of the barbiturate type have occurred after the discontinuation of benzodiazepines ( see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE section ) .
PRECAUTIONS In debilitated patients , it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia , oversedation or confusion ( not more than 2 Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide capsules per day initially , to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated ) .
In general , the concomitant administration of Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide and other psychotropic agents is not recommended .
If such combination therapy seems indicated , careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed — particularly when the known potentiating compounds such as the MAO inhibitors and phenothiazines are to be used .
The usual precautions in treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed .
Paradoxical reactions to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride , eg , excitement , stimulation and acute rage , have been reported in psychiatric patients and should be watched for during Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide therapy .
The usual precautions are indicated when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride is used in the treatment of anxiety states where there is any evidence of impending depression ; it should be borne in mind that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary .
Although clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship , physicians should be aware that variable effects on blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral anticoagulants and chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride .
Information for Patients To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines , patients should be informed that , since benzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical dependence , it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use Geriatric subjects may be particularly prone to experiencing drowsiness , ataxia and confusion while receiving Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide .
These effects can usually be avoided with proper dosage adjustment , although they have occasionally been observed even at the lower dosage ranges .
Dosing in geriatric subjects should be initiated cautiously ( no more than 2 capsules per day ) and increased gradually if needed and tolerated ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide is contraindicated in the presence of glaucoma , prostatic hypertrophy and benign bladder neck obstruction ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS No side effects or manifestations not seen with either compound alone have been reported with the administration of Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide .
However , the possibility of untoward effects which may be seen with either of these two compounds cannot be excluded .
When chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride has been used alone the necessity of discontinuing therapy because of undesirable effects has been rare .
Drowsiness , ataxia and confusion have been reported in some patients — particularly the elderly and debilitated .
While these effects can be avoided in almost all instances by proper dosage adjustment , they have occasionally been observed at the lower dosage ranges .
In a few instances syncope has been reported .
Other adverse reactions reported during therapy with chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride include isolated instances of skin eruptions , edema , minor menstrual irregularities , nausea and constipation , extrapyramidal symptoms , as well as increased and decreased libido .
Such side effects have been infrequent and are generally controlled with reduction of dosage .
Changes in EEG patterns ( low - voltage fast activity ) have been observed in patients during and after chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride treatment .
Blood dyscrasias , including agranulocytosis , jaundice and hepatic dysfunction have occasionally been reported during therapy with chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride .
When chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride treatment is protracted , periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable .
Adverse effects reported with use of Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide are those typical of anticolinergic agents , ie , dryness of the mouth , blurring of vision , urinary hesitancy and constipation .
Constipation has occurred most often when Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide therapy has been combined with other spasmolytic agents and / or a low residue diet .
DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Withdrawal symptoms , similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol ( convulsions , tremor , abdominal and muscle cramps , vomiting and sweating ) , have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of chlordiazepoxide .
The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who had received excessive doses over an extended period of time .
Generally milder withdrawal symptoms ( eg , dysphoria and insomnia ) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months .
Consequently , after extended therapy , abrupt discontinuation should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed .
Addiction - prone individuals ( such as drug addicts or alcoholics ) should be under careful surveillance when receiving chlordiazepoxide or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to habituation and dependence .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Because of the varied individual responses to tranquilizers and anticholinergics , the optimum dosage of Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide varies with the diagnosis and response of the individual patient .
The dosage , therefore , should be individualized for maximum beneficial effects .
The usual maintenance dose is 1 or 2 capsules , 3 or 4 times a day administered before meals and at bedtime .
Geriatric Dosing Dosage should be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia , oversedation or confusion .
The initial dose should not exceed 2 Chlordiazepoxide HCl / Clidinium Bromide capsules per day , to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated .
