FOR SUBCUTANEOUS USE ONLY DESCRIPTION Cetrotide ® ( cetrorelix acetate for injection ) is a synthetic decapeptide with gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) antagonistic activity .
Cetrorelix acetate is an analog of native GnRH with substitutions of amino acids at positions 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , and 10 .
The molecular formula is Acetyl - D - 3 - ( 2 ´ - naphtyl ) - alanine - D - 4 - chlorophenylalanine - D - 3 - ( 3 ´ - pyridyl ) - alanine - L - serine - L - tyrosine - D - citruline - L - leucine - L - arginine - L - proline - D - alanine - amide , and the molecular weight is 1431 . 06 , calculated as the anhydrous free base .
The structural formula is as follows : Cetrorelix acetate [ MULTIMEDIA ] ( Ac - D - Nal1 - D - Cpa2 - D - Pal3 - Ser4 - Tyr5 - D - Cit6 - Leu7 - Arg8 - Pro9 - D - Ala10 - NH2 ) Cetrotide ® ( cetrorelix acetate for injection ) 0 . 25 mg is a sterile lyophilized powder intended for subcutaneous injection after reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection , USP ( pH 5 - 8 ) , that comes supplied in a 1 . 0 mL pre - filled syringe .
Each vial of Cetrotide ® 0 . 25 mg contains 0 . 26 - 0 . 27 mg cetrorelix acetate , equivalent to 0 . 25 mg cetrorelix , and 54 . 80 mg mannitol .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY GnRH induces the production and release of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) from the gonadotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary .
Due to a positive estradiol ( E2 ) feedback at midcycle , GnRH liberation is enhanced resulting in an LH - surge .
This LH - surge induces the ovulation of the dominant follicle , resumption of oocyte meiosis and subsequently luteinization as indicated by rising progesterone levels .
Cetrotide ® competes with natural GnRH for binding to membrane receptors on pituitary cells and thus controls the release of LH and FSH in a dose - dependent manner .
The onset of LH suppression is approximately one hour with the 3 mg dose and two hours with the 0 . 25 mg dose .
This suppression is maintained by continuous treatment and there is a more pronounced effect on LH than on FSH .
An initial release of endogenous gonadotropins has not been detected with Cetrotide ® , which is consistent with an antagonist effect .
The effects of Cetrotide ® on LH and FSH are reversible after discontinuation of treatment .
In women , Cetrotide ® delays the LH - surge , and consequently ovulation , in a dose - dependent fashion .
FSH levels are not affected at the doses used during controlled ovarian stimulation .
Following a single 3 mg dose of Cetrotide ® , duration of action of at least 4 days has been established .
A dose of Cetrotide ® 0 . 25 mg every 24 hours has been shown to maintain the effect .
Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic parameters of single and multiple doses of Cetrotide ® ( cetrorelix acetate for injection ) in adult healthy female subjects are summarized in Table 1 .

The mean absolute bioavailability of Cetrotide ® following subcutaneous administration to healthy female subjects is 85 % .
Distribution The volume of distribution of Cetrotide ® following a single intravenous dose of 3 mg is about 1 l / kg .
In vitro protein binding to human plasma is 86 % .
Cetrotide ® concentrations in follicular fluid and plasma were similar on the day of oocyte pick - up in patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation .
Following subcutaneous administration of Cetrotide ® 0 . 25 mg and 3 mg , plasma concentrations of cetrorelix were below or in the range of the lower limit of quantitation on the day of oocyte pick - up and embryo transfer .
Metabolism After subcutaneous administration of 10 mg Cetrotide ® to females and males , Cetrotide ® and small amounts of ( 1 - 9 ) , ( 1 - 7 ) , ( 1 - 6 ) , and ( 1 - 4 ) peptides were found in bile samples over 24 hours .
In in vitro studies , Cetrotide ® was stable against phase I - and phase II - metabolism .
Cetrotide ® was transformed by peptidases , and the ( 1 - 4 ) peptide was the predominant metabolite .
Excretion Following subcutaneous administration of 10 mg cetrorelix to males and females , only unchanged cetrorelix was detected in urine .
In 24 hours , cetrorelix and small amounts of the ( 1 - 9 ) , ( 1 - 7 ) , ( 1 - 6 ) , and ( 1 - 4 ) peptides were found in bile samples .
2 - 4 % of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged cetrorelix , while 5 - 10 % was eliminated as cetrorelix and the four metabolites in bile .
Therefore , only 7 - 14 % of the total dose was recovered as unchanged cetrorelix and metabolites in urine and bile up to 24 hours .
The remaining portion of the dose may not have been recovered since bile and urine were not collected for a longer period of time .
Special Populations Pharmacokinetic investigations have not been performed either in subjects with impaired renal or liver function , or in the elderly , or in children ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Pharmacokinetic differences in different races have not been determined .
There is no evidence of differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for Cetrotide ® between healthy subjects and patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation .
Drug - Drug Interactions No formal drug - drug interaction studies have been performed with Cetrotide ® ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Clinical Studies Seven hundred thirty two ( 732 ) patients were treated with Cetrotide ® ( cetrorelix acetate for injection ) in five ( two Phase 2 dose - finding and three Phase 3 ) clinical trials .
The clinical trial population consisted of Caucasians ( 95 . 5 % ) and Black , Asian , Arabian and others ( 4 . 5 % ) .
Women were between 19 and 40 years of age ( mean : 32 ) .
The studies excluded subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , subjects with low or no ovarian reserve , and subjects with stage III - IV endometriosis .
Two dose regimens were investigated in these clinical trials , either a single dose per treatment cycle or multiple dosing .
In the Phase 2 studies , a single dose of 3 mg was established as the minimal effective dose for the inhibition of premature LH surges with a protection period of at least 4 days .
When Cetrotide ® is administered in a multidose regimen , 0 . 25 mg was established as the minimal effective dose .
The extent and duration of LH - suppression is dose dependent .
In the Phase 3 program , efficacy of the single 3 mg dose regimen of Cetrotide ® and the multiple 0 . 25 mg dose regimen of Cetrotide ® was established separately in two adequate and well controlled clinical studies utilizing active comparators .
A third non - comparative clinical study evaluated only the multiple 0 . 25 mg dose regimen of Cetrotide ® .
The ovarian stimulation treatment with recombinant FSH or human menopausal gonadotropin ( hMG ) was initiated on day 2 or 3 of a normal menstrual cycle .
The dose of gonadotropins was administered according to the individual patient ' s disposition and response .
In the single dose regimen study , Cetrotide ® 3 mg was administered on the day of controlled ovarian stimulation when adequate estradiol levels ( 400 pg / mL ) were obtained , usually on day 7 ( range day 5 - 12 ) .
If hCG was not given within 4 days of the 3 mg dose of Cetrotide ® , then 0 . 25 mg of Cetrotide ® was administered daily beginning 96 hours after the 3 mg injection until and including the day of hCG administration .
In the two multiple dose regimen studies , Cetrotide ® 0 . 25 mg was started on day 5 or 6 of COS .
Both gonadotropins and Cetrotide ® were continued daily ( multiple dose regimen ) until the injection of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) .
Oocyte pick - up ( OPU ) followed by in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) as well as embryo transfer ( ET ) were subsequently performed .
The results for Cetrotide ® are summarized below in Table 2 .

In the five Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials , 184 pregnancies have been reported out of a total of 732 patients ( including 21 pregnancies following the replacement of frozen - thawed embryos ) .
In the 3 mg regimen , 9 patients received an additional dose of 0 . 25 mg of Cetrotide ® and two other patients received two additional doses of 0 . 25 mg Cetrotide ® .
The median number of days of Cetrotide ® multiple dose treatment was 5 ( range 1 - 15 ) in both studies .
No drug related allergic reactions were reported from these clinical studies .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cetrotide ® ( cetrorelix acetate for injection ) is indicated for the inhibition of premature LH surges in women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Cetrotide ® ( cetrorelix acetate for injection ) is contraindicated under the following conditions : • Hypersensitivity to cetrorelix acetate , extrinsic peptide hormones or mannitol .
• Known hypersensitivity to GnRH or any other GnRH analogs .
• Known or suspected pregnancy , and lactation ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
• Severe renal impairment WARNINGS Cetrotide ® ( cetrorelix acetate for injection ) should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in fertility treatment .
Before starting treatment with Cetrotide ® , pregnancy must be excluded ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ) .
PRECAUTIONS General Cases of hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactoid reactions with the first dose , have been reported during post - marketing surveillance ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
A severe anaphylactic reaction associated with cough , rash , and hypotension , was observed in one patient after seven months of treatment with Cetrotide ® ( 10 mg / day ) in a study for an indication unrelated to infertility .
Special care should be taken in women with signs and symptoms of active allergic conditions or known history of allergic predisposition .
Treatment with Cetrotide ® is not advised in women with severe allergic conditions .
Information for Patients Prior to therapy with Cetrotide ® ( cetrorelix acetate for injection ) , patients should be informed of the duration of treatment and monitoring procedures that will be required .
The risk of possible adverse reactions should be discussed ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Cetrotide ® should not be prescribed if a patient is pregnant .
If Cetrotide ® is prescribed to patients for self - administration , information for proper use is given in the Patient Leaflet ( see below ) .
Laboratory Tests After the exclusion of preexisting conditions , enzyme elevations ( ALT , AST , GGT , alkaline phosphatase ) were found in 1 - 2 % of patients receiving Cetrotide ® during controlled ovarian stimulation .
The elevations ranged up to three times the upper limit of normal .
The clinical significance of these findings was not determined .
During stimulation with human menopausal gonadotropin , Cetrotide ® had no notable effects on hormone levels aside from inhibition of LH surges .
Drug Interactions No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with Cetrotide ® .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term carcinogenicity studies in animals have not been performed with cetrorelix acetate .
Cetrorelix acetate was not genotoxic in vitro ( Ames test , HPRT test , chromosome aberration test ) or in vivo ( chromosome aberration test , mouse micronucleus test ) .
Cetrorelix acetate induced polyploidy in CHL - Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts , but not in V79 - Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts , cultured peripheral human lymphocytes or in an in vitro micronucleus test in the CHL - cell line .
Treatment with 0 . 46 mg / kg cetrorelix acetate for 4 weeks resulted in complete infertility in female rats which was reversed 8 weeks after cessation of treatment .
Pregnancy ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) Cetrotide ® is contraindicated in pregnant women .
When administered to rats for the first seven days of pregnancy , cetrorelix acetate did not affect the development of the implanted conceptus at doses up to 38 μg / kg ( approximately 1 times the recommended human therapeutic dose based on body surface area ) .
However , a dose of 139 μg / kg ( approximately 4 times the human dose ) resulted in a resorption rate and a postimplantation loss of 100 % .
When administered from day 6 to near term to pregnant rats and rabbits , very early resorptions and total implantation losses were seen in rats at doses from 4 . 6 μg / kg ( 0 . 2 times the human dose ) and in rabbits at doses from 6 . 8 μg / kg ( 0 . 4 times the human dose ) .
In animals that maintained their pregnancy , there was no increase in the incidence of fetal abnormalities .
The fetal resorption observed in animals is a logical consequence of the alteration in hormonal levels effected by the antigonadotrophic properties of Cetrotide ® , which could result in fetal loss in humans as well .
Therefore , this drug should not be used in pregnant women .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Cetrotide ® is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , and because the effects of Cetrotide ® on lactation and / or the breast - fed child have not been determined , Cetrotide ® should not be used by nursing mothers .
Geriatric Use Cetrotide ® is not intended to be used in subjects aged 65 and over .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of Cetrotide ® ( cetrorelix acetate for injection ) in 949 patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation in clinical studies was evaluated .
Women were between 19 and 40 years of age ( mean : 32 ) .
94 . 0 % of them were Caucasian .
Cetrotide ® was given in doses ranging from 0 . 1 mg to 5 mg as either a single or multiple dose .
Table 3 shows systemic adverse events , reported in clinical studies without regard to causality , from the beginning of Cetrotide ® treatment until confirmation of pregnancy by ultrasound at an incidence ≥ 1 % in Cetrotide ® treated subjects undergoing COS .
Table 3 : Adverse Events in ≥ 1 % ( WHO preferred term ) Cetrotide ® N = 949 % ( n ) Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome [ 1 ] 3 . 5 ( 33 ) Nausea 1 . 3 ( 12 ) Headache 1 . 1 ( 10 ) [ 1 ] Intensity moderate or severe , or WHO Grade II or III , respectively Local site reactions ( e . g . redness , erythema , bruising , itching , swelling , and pruritus ) were reported .
Usually , they were of a transient nature , mild intensity and short duration .
During post - marketing surveillance , cases of mild to moderate Ovarian Hyperstimulation syndrome and infrequent cases of hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactoid reactions have been reported .
Two stillbirths were reported in Phase 3 studies of Cetrotide ® .
Congenital Anomalies Clinical follow - up studies of 316 newborns of women administered Cetrotide ® were reviewed .
One infant of a set of twin neonates was found to have anencephaly at birth and died after four days .
The other twin was normal .
Developmental findings from ongoing baby follow - up included a child with a ventricular septal defect and another child with bilateral congenital glaucoma .
Four pregnancies that resulted in therapeutic abortion in Phase 2 and Phase 3 controlled ovarian stimulation studies had major anomalies ( diaphragmatic hernia , trisomy 21 , Klinefelter syndrome , polymalformation , and trisomy 18 ) .
In three of these four cases , intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) was the fertilization method employed ; in the fourth case , in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) was the method employed .
The minor congenital anomalies reported include : supernumerary nipple , bilateral strabismus , imperforate hymen , congenital nevi , hemangiomata , and QT syndrome .
The causal relationship between the reported anomalies and Cetrotide ® is unknown .
Multiple factors , genetic and others ( including , but not limited to ICSI , IVF , gonadotropins , and progesterone ) make causal attribution difficult to study .
OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of overdosage with Cetrotide ® 0 . 25 mg or 3 mg in humans .
Single doses up to 120 mg Cetrotide ® have been well tolerated in patients treated for other indications without signs of overdosage .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ovarian stimulation therapy with gonadotropins ( FSH , hMG ) is started on cycle Day 2 or 3 .
The dose of gonadotropins should be adjusted according to individual response .
Cetrotide ® ( cetrorelix acetate for injection ) 0 . 25 mg may be administered subcutaneously once daily during the early - to mid - follicular phase .
Cetrotide ® 0 . 25 mg is administered on either stimulation day 5 ( morning or evening ) or day 6 ( morning ) and continued daily until the day of hCG administration .
When assessment by ultrasound shows a sufficient number of follicles of adequate size , hCG is administered to induce ovulation and final maturation of the oocytes .
No hCG should be administered if the ovaries show an excessive response to the treatment with gonadotropins to reduce the chance of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) .
Administration Cetrotide ® 0 . 25 mg can be administered by the patient herself after appropriate instructions by her doctor .
