BLOOD PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS : CENTRIFUGATION • 1 .
Load unit into centrifuge bucket , ensuring that the tubing stays in the top half of the bucket .
When bags and tubing are positioned in the bucket , place the red blood cell filter in a horizontal position on top of the entire assembly and secure with tape , band , or Leukotrap ® Strap .
• 2 .
Centrifuge at appropriate conditions to produce desired components .
V . BLOOD PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS : PREPARING SET Note : Prior to expression , ensure tubing between the Y - connector and the filter ( non - numbered tubing ) is clamped .
For efficient processing , the tubing may be clamped prior to removing the unit from the centrifuge bucket .
• 1 .
Carefully remove the unit from the centrifuge and place the bag containing red cells in the plasma expressor .
• 2 .
Gently apply expressor pressure .
• 3 .
If not previously clamped , clamp the non - numbered tubing between the Y - connector and the filter .
• 4 .
Clamp tubing to extra satellite bag , if present .
VI .
BLOOD PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS : EXPRESSING PLASMA • 1 .
Open snap - open closure of the bag containing red cells and express plasma or platelet - rich plasma into a satellite bag .
• 2 .
Stop expression by clamping or sealing the tubing leading to satellite bag ( s ) and release expressor pressure .
• 3 .
If not already sealed , seal tubing below the Y - connector leading to all satellite bags .
* Detach and set aside the plasma or platelet - rich plasma for further processing .
Notes : If preparing a platelet concentrate , the platelet - rich plasma should be separated from the red blood cells within 8 hours after collection .
If preparing Fresh Frozen Plasma , the plasma should be separated from the red blood cells and placed in the freezer at – 18 ° C or colder within 8 hours after blood collection .
If preparing Plasma Frozen within 24 Hours after Phlebotomy , the plasma should be separated from the red blood cells and placed in the freezer at – 18 ° C or colder within 24 hours after blood collection .
VII .
BLOOD PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS : TRANSFERRING ADDITIVE Note : The snap - open closure may be opened prior to hanging the bag containing the AS - 3 additive solution for additive transfer , provided the non - numbered tubing between the bag containing the red cells and the filter is clamped .
• 1 .
Hang the bag containing the AS - 3 additive solution so that the numbered tubing is fully extended and ensure the filter is in a vertical position and above the bag .
• 2 .
Open clamp or snap - open closure of the bag containing the AS - 3 additive solution , and transfer to the bag containing red blood cells .
Note : AS - 3 additive solution should be added to the bag containing the red blood cells immediately after plasma or platelet - rich plasma removal .
• 3 .
Transfer AS - 3 additive solution under one of the following conditions : • A . Within 8 hours of collection if blood is held at room temperature .
• B . Within 72 hours of collection if blood is refrigerated after collection .
VIII .
BLOOD FILTRATION INSTRUCTIONS • 1 .
Clamp the non - numbered tubing prior to raising the bag containing red blood cells and AS - 3 additive solution for mixing in order to avoid the introduction of air into the filter .
• 2 .
Mix red cells gently and thoroughly .
• 3 .
Hang the collection bag at one of the following heights : • A . 60 ± 2 inches for blood stored and filtered at room temperature .
• B . 60 to 72 inches for blood stored and filtered at 1 — 6 ° C . • 4 .
Ensure filter is vertical and remove clamp to allow red blood cells to gravity flow through the filter and into the red cell storage bag .
Notes : Do not apply mechanical or manual pressure to increase flow rate .
Filtration can begin at room temperature up to 8 hours or at 1 — 6 ° C up to 72 hours post - collection .
If unit has not completely filtered by 8 hours post - collection at room temperature , filtration must be completed at 1 — 6 ° C . Filtration at maximum head height may shorten filtration times .
“ Head height ” is the distance from the top of the bag containing the blood to be filtered to the horizontal plane where the filtered blood bag rests .
Filtration can be unattended .
Filtration times can be influenced by collection and processing conditions and biological variability of donors .
Experimental data with some filter products indicate that a prolonged filtration can be an indication of sub - optimal leukocyte reduction .
• 5 .
Filtration is complete when the collection bag is empty .
To maximize red blood cell recovery , allow the tubing above the filter to empty .
• 6 .
Clamp and seal tubing below the filter .
* The numbered tubing downstream of the filter will not drain .
Notes : If the numbered tubing below the filter has drained ( emptied ) after filtration , it is recommended to perform a residual white blood cell count on the unit .
Do not strip tubing prior to sealing the tubing below the filter .
If it is desired to strip blood from numbered tubing , do so only after tubing has been sealed close to the filter and detached .
If it is necessary to strip blood from numbered tubing , care should be taken when stripping is performed .
Increased ( mechanical ) hemolysis has been associated with stripping when blood is cold and has a higher hematocrit .
Do not strip forcefully or frequently against a snap - open closure .
• 7 .
Detach and discard collection bag and filter .
* • 8 .
If desired , seal at or adjacent to " X " marks on tubing to provide numbered segments of anticoagulated blood for typing or crossmatching .
* If quality control is to be performed on post - filtration sample , use the attached QC line on the bag containing red cells .
• 9 .
Store CP2D / AS - 3 preserved red blood cells at 1 — 6 ° C for up to 42 days and use as indicated .
Note : If AS - 3 additive solution is not used , whole blood or red blood cells in CP2D alone may be stored at 1 — 6 ° C for up to 21 days .
IX .
QUALITY CONTROL TESTING • Percent red cell recovery should be determined by following FDA Guidance entitled “ Guidance for Industry - Pre - Storage Leukocyte Reduction of Whole Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion ” , published in September 2012 .
• During processing , always observe the following precautions : • 1 .
Sealing should be done in a manner that avoids fluid splatter .
• 2 .
Always dispose of blood - contaminated products in a manner consistent with established BIOHAZARD safety procedures .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] WARNINGS • Failure to achieve and maintain a closed system during processing will result in a product that must be transfused within 24 hours .
PRECAUTIONS General • 1 .
Use aseptic technique .
• 2 .
Use only if solutions are clear .
• 3 .
If moisture is observed on the outside of the collection system when removed from the cellophane pouch , subsequent handling and storage of an unused set within the foil pouch could encourage the growth of mold on the base label .
Unused bags in opened foil pouches may be kept 30 days by folding and SECURING open end of pouch to prevent possible loss of moisture .
