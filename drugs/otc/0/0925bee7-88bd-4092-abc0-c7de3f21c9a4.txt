OVERDOSAGE Antihistamine overdosage reactions may vary from central nervous system depression to stimulation .
Stimulation is particularly likely in children .
Atropine - like signs and symptoms — dry mouth , fixed , dilated pupils , flushing , and gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur .
If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously the patient should be induced to vomit .
This is best done by having the patient drink a glass of water or milk after which the patient should be made to gag .
Precautions against aspiration must be taken , especially in infants and children .
Saline cathartics , such as milk of magnesia , draw water into the bowel by osmosis and therefore , are valuable for their action in rapid dilution of bowel content .
Stimulants should not be used .
Vasopressors may be used to treat hypotension .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION DOSAGE SHOULD BE INDIVIDUALIZED ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT .
