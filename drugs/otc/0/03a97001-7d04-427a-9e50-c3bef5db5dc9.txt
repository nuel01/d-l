6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data described below reflect exposure to ESKATA or vehicle in a total of 937 subjects with seborrheic keratoses that are raised .
Overall , 42 % of the subjects were male and 58 % were female .
Ninety - eight ( 98 ) percent of the subjects were Caucasian and the mean age was 68 . 7 years .
At each visit , local skin reactions were graded for severity to determine the maximum severity after treatment .
Table 1 presents the percentage of subjects with the local adverse reactions by the most severe grade reported during the course of the trials .

Common local skin reactions observed 15 weeks after the initial treatment are erythema ( 21 % ) , hyperpigmentation ( 18 % ) , scaling ( 16 % ) , crusting ( 12 % ) , and hypopigmentation ( 7 % ) .
Less common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 0 . 5 % of subjects treated with ESKATA include eyelid edema ( 0 . 6 % ) and herpes zoster ( 0 . 6 % ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of ESKATA .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Skin and subcutaneous tissues disorders : crepitus 8 .
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Hydrogen peroxide is not absorbed systemically following topical administration , and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Hydrogen peroxide is not absorbed systemically by the mother following topical administration , and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to hydrogen peroxide .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Seborrheic keratosis is not seen in the pediatric population .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 841 subjects treated with ESKATA in the clinical trials , 70 % were 65 years of age and older and 26 % were 75 years of age and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects .

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action for ESKATA for the treatment of seborrheic keratosis is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of ESKATA in the treatment of seborrheic keratosis are unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following application of ESKATA in patients with seborrheic keratosis lesions , hydrogen peroxide rapidly dissociates into water and reactive oxygen species .
Indirect assessment of reactive oxygen species in patients with seborrheic keratosis lesions did not demonstrate any systemic absorption of hydrogen peroxide .
13 .
NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ESKATA or hydrogen peroxide .
Hydrogen peroxide has been found to exhibit positive results in in vitro tests for genotoxicity , but has not exhibited positive results in in vivo tests for genotoxicity , presumably due to the rapid metabolism of hydrogen peroxide .
The effects of hydrogen peroxide on fertility have not been evaluated .
Hydrogen peroxide has been associated with effects on sperm function and elevated testicular hydrogen peroxide concentration has been implicated in male infertility , although in vivo , no effect of hydrogen peroxide on sperm function has been demonstrated .
14 .
CLINICAL STUDIES In two double - blind , vehicle - controlled clinical trials , 937 subjects with 4 clinically typical seborrheic keratoses that are raised on the face , trunk , or extremities were randomized to treatment with either ESKATA or vehicle .
Subjects ranged from 42 to 91 years of age ( mean 68 . 7 years ) , 58 % percent were female , and 98 % were Caucasian .
A total of 925 subjects completed the trials .
Each lesion was treated with 4 applications , at baseline and again at Day 22 , if needed , and subjects were followed through Day 106 .
Efficacy was assessed at Day 106 .
Success rate was defined as the proportion of subjects achieving " clear " on the Physician ' s Lesion Assessment Scale for all 4 treated lesions .
Efficacy was also assessed for the proportion of subjects achieving " clear " on the Physician ' s Lesion Assessment Scale for at least 3 of 4 lesions .
Table 3 presents the efficacy results for the two clinical trials .
