6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of the corneal collagen cross - linking procedure was evaluated in 3 randomized , parallel - group , open - label , sham - controlled trials ; patients were followed up for 12 months .
Study 1 enrolled patients with progressive keratoconus or corneal ectasia following refractive surgery .
Study 2 enrolled only patients with progressive keratoconus , and Study 3 enrolled only patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery .
In each study , only one eye of each patient was designated as the study eye .
Study eyes were randomized to receive one of the two study treatments ( CXL or sham ) at the baseline visit and were followed up at Day 1 , Week 1 , and Months 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 .
At Month 3 or later , sham study eyes and non - study eyes had the option of receiving CXL treatment , and were followed - up for 12 months from the time of receiving CXL treatment .
Each CXL treated eye received a single course of CXL treatment only .
Safety data were obtained from : 193 randomized CXL study eyes ( 102 keratoconus , 91 corneal ectasia ) , 191 control eyes , and 319 nonrandomized CXL non - study eyes ( 191 keratoconus , 128 corneal ectasia ) .
Overall , 512 eyes ( 293 keratoconus , 219 corneal ectasia ) in 364 patients received CXL treatment .
In progressive keratoconus patients , the most common ocular adverse reactions in any CXL - treated eye were corneal opacity ( haze ) , punctate keratitis , corneal striae , corneal epithelium defect , eye pain , reduced visual acuity , and blurred vision ( Table 1 ) .
In corneal ectasia patients , the most common ocular adverse reactions were corneal opacity ( haze ) , corneal epithelium defect , corneal striae , dry eye , eye pain , punctate keratitis , photophobia , reduced visual acuity , and blurred vision .
These events are expected sequelae following epithelial corneal debridement and occurred at a higher incidence than observed in control patients , who did not undergo debridement or exposure to UVA light ( Table 1 ) .
Adverse events reported in non - study , non - randomized CXL treated were similar in terms of preferred terms and frequency to those seen in randomized study eyes .
The majority of adverse events reported resolved during the first month , while events such as corneal epithelium defect , corneal striae , punctate keratitis , photophobia , dry eye and eye pain , and decreased visual acuity took up to 6 months to resolve and corneal opacity or haze took up to 12 months to resolve .
In 1 - 2 % of patients , corneal epithelium defect , corneal edema , corneal opacity and corneal scar continued to be observed at 12 months .
In 6 % of corneal ectasia patients , corneal opacity continued to be observed at 12 months .
Table 1 : Most Common ( ≥ 1 % ) Ocular Adverse Reactions in CXL - Treated Study Eye in the Pooled Randomized Safety Population – N ( % ) 1 ) Results are presented as the number ( % ) of patients with an event from baseline to Month 3 .
2 ) Almost all cases of corneal opacity were reported as haze .

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 .
Mechanism of Action Riboflavin 5 ’ - phosphate sodium ( Vitamin B2 ) is the precursor of two coenzymes , flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide , which catalyze oxidation / reduction reactions involved in a number of metabolic pathways .
Under the conditions used for corneal collagen cross - linking , riboflavin 5 ‘ - phosphate functions as a photoenhancer and generates singlet oxygen which is responsible for the cross - linking .
13 .
NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Animal studies have not been conducted to determine the carcinogenic potential of photoexcited riboflavin .
Photoexcited riboflavin has been shown to be genotoxic in the Ames Salmonella reverse mutation assay and in the SOS / umu test system .
The genotoxicity of riboflavin , in the absence of photoexcitation has been examined in vitro in bacterial reverse mutation assays , sister chromatid exchange assay , chromosomal aberration assays and in vivo in a mouse micronucleus study .
The overall weight of evidence indicates that riboflavin , in the absence of photoexcitation , is not genotoxic .
Animal studies to determine the effects of the PHOTREXA / KXL corneal collagen cross - linking procedure on fertility were not conducted .
14 .
CLINICAL STUDIES Three prospective , randomized , parallel - group , open - label , sham - controlled trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of riboflavin ophthalmic solution / UVA irradiation for performing corneal collagen cross - linking .
These trials were sham - controlled for the first 3 months and had a total duration of 12 months for safety and efficacy evaluations .
Study 1 enrolled 58 patients with progressive keratoconus and 49 patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery .
Study 2 enrolled 147 patients with progressive keratoconus , and Study 3 enrolled 130 patients with corneal ectasia following refractive surgery .
In each study , patients had one eye designated as the study eye and were randomized to receive one of two study treatments ( CXL or sham ) in their study eye at the baseline visit .
The patients were evaluated at Day 1 , Week 1 , and Months 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 .
At Month 3 or later , patients had the option of receiving CXL treatment in both the sham study eyes and non - study eyes and were followed - up for 12 months from the time of receiving CXL treatment .
Approximately 56 % and 89 % of the sham study eyes in patients with progressive keratoconus received CXL treatment by Month 3 and Month 6 , respectively .
The average age of keratoconus patients was 33 years .
The average baseline Kmax value was 61 diopters .
For corneal ectasia patients in Study 1 and Study 3 , approximately 60 % and 90 % of the sham study eyes received CXL treatment by Month 3 and Month 6 , respectively .
The average age of corneal ectasia patients was 43 years and the average baseline Kmax was 55 diopters .
A majority ( 93 % ) of the corneal ectasia patients had LASIK only , 5 ( 3 % ) patients had photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) only , and 8 ( 4 % ) patients had both LASIK and PRK .
In each study , the maximum corneal curvature ( Kmax ) was assessed at baseline , Months 1 , 3 , and 12 .
The CXL - treated eyes showed increasing improvement in Kmax from Month 3 through Month 12 ( Figure 1 ) .
Progressive keratoconus patients had an average Kmax reduction of 1 . 4 diopters in Study 1 and 1 . 7 diopters in Study 2 at Month 12 in the CXL - treated eyes while the sham eyes had an average increase of 0 . 5 diopter in Study 1 and 0 . 6 diopter in Study 2 at Month 12 ; the difference ( 95 % CI ) between the CXL and sham groups in the mean change from baseline Kmax were - 1 . 9 ( - 3 . 4 , - 0 . 3 ) diopters in Study 1 and - 2 . 3 ( - 3 . 5 , - 1 . 0 ) diopters in Study 2 .
For corneal ectasia patients , at Month 12 , the CXL - treated eyes had an average Kmax reduction of 1 . 0 diopter in Study 1 and 0 . 5 diopter in Study 3 while the sham eyes had an average increase of 1 . 0 diopter in Study 1 and 0 . 5 diopter in Study 3 ; the treatment difference between the CXL and sham groups was : - 2 . 0 ( - 3 . 0 , - 1 . 1 ) diopters in Study 1 and - 1 . 1 ( - 1 . 9 , - 0 . 3 ) diopters in Study 3 .
Figure 1 : Mean ( SD ) ( Diopter ) Baseline Kmax and Change from Baseline Kmax [ MULTIMEDIA ] Post - baseline missing data were imputed using last available Kmax value .
For the sham study eyes that received CXL treatment after baseline , the last Kmax measurement recorded prior to receiving CXL treatment was used in the analysis for later time points .
In Study 3 , four patients in the CXL group had missing baseline Kmax value and were excluded from the analysis .
