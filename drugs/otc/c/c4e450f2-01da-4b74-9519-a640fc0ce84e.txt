12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ivermectin cream in treating rosacea lesions is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology At therapeutic doses , ivermectin cream is not expected to prolong QTc interval .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absorption of ivermectin from ivermectin cream was evaluated in a clinical trial in 15 adult male and female subjects with severe papulopustular rosacea applying 1 g ivermectin cream , 1 % once daily .
At steady state ( after 2 weeks of treatment ) , the highest mean ± standard deviation ) plasma concentrations of ivermectin peaked ( Tmax ) at 10 ± 8 hours post - dose , the maximum concentration ( Cmax ) was 2 . 10 ± 1 . 04 ng / mL ( range : 0 . 69 to 4 . 02 ng / mL ) and the area under the concentration curve ( AUC0 - 24 hr ) was 36 . 14 ± 15 . 56 ng . hr / mL ( range : 13 . 69 to 75 . 16 ng • hr / mL ) .
In addition , systemic exposure assessment in longer treatment duration ( Phase 3 studies ) showed that there was no plasma accumulation of ivermectin over the 52 - week treatment period .
Distribution An in vitro study demonstrated that ivermectin is greater than 99 % bound to plasma proteins and is bound primarily to human serum albumin .
No significant binding of ivermectin to erythrocytes was observed .
Metabolism In vitro studies using human hepatic microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 .
In vitro studies show that ivermectin at therapeutic concentrations does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes 1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 , 3A4 or 4A11 , or induce 1A2 , 2B6 , 2C9 or 3A4 .
Excretion The apparent terminal half - life averaged 6 . 5 days ( mean ± standard deviation : 155 ± 40 hours , range 92 to 238 hours ) in patients receiving a once daily cutaneous application of ivermectin cream for 28 days .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 2 - year dermal mouse carcinogenicity study , ivermectin was administered to CD - 1 mice at topical doses of 1 , 3 , and 10 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 1 % , 0 . 3 % and 1 % ivermectin cream applied at 2 mL / kg / day ) .
No drug - related tumors were noted in this study up to the highest dose evaluated in this study of 10 mg / kg / day ( 747 X maximum topical human dose ( MTHD ) ) .
In a 2 - year oral rat carcinogenicity study , ivermectin was administered to Wistar rats at gavage doses of 1 mg / kg / day , 3 mg / kg / day , and 9 mg / kg / day .
A statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular adenoma was noted in males treated with 9 mg / kg / day ( 1766 X MTHD ) ivermectin .
The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown .
No drug - related tumors were noted in females up to the highest dose evaluated in this study of 9 mg / kg / day ( 1959 X MTHD ) .
No drug - related tumors were noted in males at doses less than or equal to 3 mg / kg / day ( 599 X MTHD ) .
Ivermectin revealed no evidence of genotoxic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests ( the Ames test and the L5178Y / TK + / - mouse lymphoma assay ) and one in vivo genotoxicity test ( rat micronucleus assay ) .
In a fertility study , oral doses of 0 . 1 mg / kg / day , 1 mg / kg / day , and 9 mg / kg / day ivermectin were administered to male and female rats .
Mortality occurred at 9 mg / kg / day ( 1027 X MTHD ) .
The precoital period was generally prolonged at 9 mg / kg / day .
No treatment related effects on fertility or mating performance were noted at doses less than or equal to 1 mg / kg / day ( 68 X MTHD ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Ivermectin cream applied once daily at bedtime was evaluated in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in two randomized , double - blind , vehicle - controlled clinical trials , which were identical in design .
The trials were conducted in 1 , 371 subjects aged 18 years and older who were treated once daily for 12 weeks with either ivermectin cream or vehicle cream .
Overall , 96 % of subjects were Caucasian and 67 % were female .
Using the 5 - point Investigator Global Assessment ( IGA ) scale ( 0 = clear , 1 = almost clear , 2 = mild , 3 = moderate , 4 = severe ) , 79 % of subjects were scored as moderate ( IGA = 3 ) and 21 % scored as severe ( IGA = 4 ) at baseline .
The co - primary efficacy endpoints in both pivotal trials were the success rate based on the IGA outcome ( percentage of subjects “ clear ” and “ almost clear ” ) and absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12 .
Table 1 presents the co - primary efficacy results at Week 12 .
Ivermectin cream was more effective than vehicle cream on the co - primary efficacy endpoints starting from 4 weeks of treatment in both studies , see Figures 1 through 4 .
