7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Strong CYP3A inhibitors : Avoid coadministration .
( 7 . 1 ) • Combined P - gp and Strong CYP3A inhibitors : Avoid coadministration .
If coadministration cannot be avoided , reduce the dose of GAVRETO .
( 2 . 4 , 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) • Strong CYP3A inducers : Avoid coadministration .
If coadministration cannot be avoided , increase the dose of GAVRETO .
( 2 . 5 , 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on GAVRETO Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors .
Coadministration of GAVRETO with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increases pralsetinib exposure , which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of GAVRETO .
Avoid coadministration of GAVRETO with combined P - gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors .
If coadministration with a combined P - gp and strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided , reduce the GAVRETO dose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Strong CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of GAVRETO with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases pralsetinib exposure , which may decrease efficacy of GAVRETO .
Avoid coadministration of GAVRETO with strong CYP3A inducers .
If coadministration of GAVRETO with strong CYP3A inducers cannot be avoided , increase the GAVRETO dose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) • Pediatric Use : Monitor open growth plates in adolescent patients .
Consider interrupting or discontinuing GAVRETO if abnormalities occur .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action , GAVRETO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on GAVRETO use in pregnant women to inform drug - associated risk .
Oral administration of pralsetinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations and embryolethality at maternal exposures below the human exposure at the clinical dose of 400 mg once daily ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal development study , once daily oral administration of pralsetinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in 100 % post - implantation loss at dose levels ≥ 20 mg / kg ( approximately 1 . 8 times the human exposure based on area under the curve [ AUC ] at the clinical dose of 400 mg ) .
Post - implantation loss also occurred at the 10 mg / kg dose level ( approximately 0 . 6 times the human exposure based on AUC at the clinical dose of 400 mg ) .
Once daily oral administration of pralsetinib at dose levels ≥ 5 mg / kg ( approximately 0 . 2 times the human AUC at the clinical dose of 400 mg ) resulted in an increase in visceral malformations and variations ( absent or small kidney and ureter , absent uterine horn , malpositioned kidney or testis , retroesophageal aortic arch ) and skeletal malformations and variations ( vertebral and rib anomalies and reduced ossification ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of pralsetinib or its metabolites in human milk or their effects on either the breastfed child or on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with GAVRETO and for 1 week after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on animal data , GAVRETO can cause embryolethality and malformations at doses resulting in exposures below the human exposure at the clinical dose of 400 mg daily [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating GAVRETO [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception GAVRETO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non - hormonal contraception during treatment with GAVRETO and for 2 weeks after the final dose .
GAVRETO may render hormonal contraceptives ineffective .
Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with GAVRETO and for 1 week after the final dose .
Infertility Based on histopathological findings in the reproductive tissues of male and female rats and a dedicated fertility study in which animals of both sexes were treated and mated to each other , GAVRETO may impair fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of GAVRETO have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older for RET - mutant MTC and RET - fusion thyroid cancer .
Use of GAVRETO in this age group is supported by evidence from an adequate and well - controlled study of GAVRETO in adults with additional population pharmacokinetic data demonstrating that age and body weight had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of pralsetinib , that the exposure of pralsetinib is expected to be similar between adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older , and that the course of RET - mutant MTC and RET - fusion thyroid cancer is sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients to allow extrapolation of data in adults to pediatric patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of GAVRETO have not been established in pediatric patients with RET fusion - positive NSCLC or in pediatric patients younger than 12 years old with RET - mutant MTC or RET - fusion thyroid cancer .
Animal Toxicity Data In a 4 - week repeat - dose toxicology study in non - human primates , physeal dysplasia in the femur occurred at doses resulting in exposures similar to the human exposure ( AUC ) at the clinical dose of 400 mg .
In rats there were findings of increased physeal thickness in the femur and sternum as well as tooth ( incisor ) abnormalities ( fractures , dentin matrix alteration , ameloblast / odontoblast degeneration , necrosis ) in both 4 - and 13 - week studies at doses resulting in exposures similar to the human exposure ( AUC ) at the clinical dose of 400 mg .
Recovery was not assessed in the 13 - week toxicology study , but increased physeal thickness in the femur and incisor degeneration did not show evidence of complete recovery in the 28 - day rat study .
Monitor growth plates in adolescent patients with open growth plates .
Consider interrupting or discontinuing therapy based on the severity of any growth plate abnormalities and based on an individual risk - benefit assessment .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 438 patients in ARROW who received the recommended dose of GAVRETO at 400 mg once daily , 30 % were 65 years or older .

11 DESCRIPTION Pralsetinib is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor .
The chemical name for pralsetinib is ( cis ) - N - ( ( S ) - 1 - ( 6 - ( 4 - fluoro - 1 H - pyrazol - 1 - yl ) pyridin - 3 - yl ) ethyl ) - 1 - methoxy - 4 - ( 4 - methyl - 6 - ( 5 - methyl - 1 H - pyrazol - 3 - ylamino ) pyrimidin - 2 - yl ) cyclohexanecarboxamide .
The molecular formula for pralsetinib is C27H32FN9O2 , and the molecular weight is 533 . 61 g / mol .
Pralsetinib has the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The solubility of pralsetinib in aqueous media decreases over the range pH 1 . 99 to pH 7 . 64 from 0 . 880 mg / mL to < 0 . 001 mg / mL , indicating a decrease in solubility with increasing pH . GAVRETO ( pralsetinib ) is supplied for oral use as immediate release hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ( HPMC ) hard capsules containing 100 mg pralsetinib .
The capsules also contain inactive ingredients : citric acid , hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ( HPMC ) , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose ( MCC ) , pregelatinized starch and sodium bicarbonate .
The capsule shell consists of FD & C Blue # 1 ( Brilliant Blue FCF ) , hypromellose and titanium dioxide .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Pralsetinib is a kinase inhibitor of wild - type RET and oncogenic RET fusions ( CCDC6 - RET ) and mutations ( RET V804L , RET V804M and RET M918T ) with half maximal inhibitory concentrations ( IC50s ) less than 0 . 5 nM .
In purified enzyme assays , pralsetinib inhibited DDR1 , TRKC , FLT3 , JAK1 - 2 , TRKA , VEGFR2 , PDGFRB , and FGFR1 at higher concentrations that were still clinically achievable at Cmax .
In cellular assays , pralsetinib inhibited RET at approximately 14 - , 40 - , and 12 - fold lower concentrations than VEGFR2 , FGFR2 , and JAK2 , respectively .
Certain RET fusion proteins and activating point mutations can drive tumorigenic potential through hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation .
Pralsetinib exhibited anti - tumor activity in cultured cells and animal tumor implantation models harboring oncogenic RET fusions or mutations including KIF5B - RET , CCDC6 - RET , RET M918T , RET C634W , RET V804E , RET V804L and RET V804M .
In addition , pralsetinib prolonged survival in mice implanted intracranially with tumor models expressing KIF5B - RET or CCDC6 - RET .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Pralsetinib exposure - response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response have not been fully characterized .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The QT interval prolongation potential of pralsetinib was assessed in 34 patients with RET - altered solid tumors administered GAVRETO at the recommended dosage .
No large mean increase in QTc ( > 20 ms ) was detected in the study .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics At 400 mg GAVRETO once daily under fasting conditions , the steady state geometric mean [ % coefficient of variation ( CV % ) ] of maximum observed plasma concentration ( Cmax ) and area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC0 - 24 h ) of pralsetinib was 2470 ( 55 . 1 % ) ng / mL and 36700 ( 66 . 3 % ) h ∙ ng / mL , respectively .
Pralsetinib Cmax and AUC increased inconsistently over the dose range of 60 mg to 600 mg once daily ( 0 . 15 to 1 . 5 times the recommended dose ) .
Pralsetinib plasma concentrations reached steady state by 3 to 5 days .
The mean accumulation ratio was approximately 2 - fold after once - daily repeated oral administration .
Absorption The median time to peak concentration ( Tmax ) ranged from 2 to 4 hours following single doses of pralsetinib 60 mg to 600 mg .
Food Effect Following administration of a single dose of 200 mg GAVRETO with a high - fat meal , ( approximately 800 to 1000 calories with 50 to 60 % of calories from fat ) , the mean ( 90 % CI ) Cmax of pralsetinib was increased by 104 % ( 65 % , 153 % ) , the mean ( 90 % CI ) AUC0 - INF was increased by 122 % ( 96 % , 152 % ) , and the median Tmax was delayed from 4 to 8 . 5 hours , compared to the fasted state .
Distribution The mean ( CV % ) apparent volume of distribution ( Vd / F ) of pralsetinib is 303 L ( 68 % ) .
Protein binding of pralsetinib is 97 . 1 % and is independent of concentration .
The blood - to - plasma ratio is 0 . 6 to 0 . 7 .
Elimination The mean ( ± standard deviation ) plasma elimination half - life ( T ½ ) of pralsetinib is 15 . 7 hours ( 9 . 8 ) following single doses and 20 hours ( 11 . 7 ) following multiple doses of pralsetinib .
The mean ( CV % ) apparent oral clearance ( CL / F ) of pralsetinib is 10 . 9 L / h ( 66 % ) at steady state .
Metabolism Pralsetinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 , in vitro .
Following a single oral dose of 310 mg of radiolabeled pralsetinib to healthy subjects , pralsetinib metabolites from oxidation and glucuronidation were detected as 5 % or less .
Excretion Approximately 73 % ( 66 % as unchanged ) of the total administered radioactive dose [ 14 C ] pralsetinib was recovered in feces and 6 % ( 4 . 8 % as unchanged ) was recovered in urine .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the PK of pralsetinib were observed based on age ( 19 to 87 years ) , sex , race ( 370 White , 22 Black , or 61 Asian ) , and body weight ( 32 . 1 to 128 kg ) .
Mild and moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 - 89 mL / min ) had no effect on the exposure of pralsetinib .
Pralsetinib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 15 mL / min ) .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ 1 . 0 × ULN and AST > ULN , or total bilirubin > 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 × ULN and any AST ) had no effect on the PK of pralsetinib .
Pralsetinib has not been studied in patients with moderate ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 . 0 × ULN and any AST ) or severe ( total bilirubin > 3 . 0 ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model - Informed Approaches Combined P - gp and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Coadministration of itraconazole 200 mg once daily with a single GAVRETO 200 mg dose increased pralsetinib Cmax by 84 % and AUC0 - INF by 251 % .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with pralsetinib have not been conducted .
Pralsetinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay with or without metabolic activation and was not clastogenic in either an in vitro micronucleus assay in TK6 cells or an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats .
In a dedicated fertility and early embryonic development study conducted in treated male rats mated to treated female rats , although pralsetinib did not have clear effects on male or female mating performance or ability to become pregnant , at the 20 mg / kg dose level ( approximately 2 . 9 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the clinical dose of 400 mg based on toxicokinetic data from the 13 - week rat toxicology study ) 82 % of female rats had totally resorbed litters , with 92 % post - implantation loss ( early resorptions ) ; post - implantation loss occurred at doses as low as 5 mg / kg ( approximately 0 . 35 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the clinical dose of 400 mg based on toxicokinetic data from the 13 - week rat toxicology study ) .
In a 13 - week repeat - dose toxicology study , male rats exhibited histopathological evidence of tubular degeneration / atrophy in the testis with secondary cellular debris and reduced sperm in the lumen of the epididymis , which correlated with lower mean testis and epididymis weights and gross observations of soft and small testis .
Female rats exhibited degeneration of the corpus luteum in the ovary .
For both sexes , these effects were observed at pralsetinib doses ≥ 10 mg / kg / day , approximately 1 times the human exposure based on AUC at the clinical dose of 400 mg .
