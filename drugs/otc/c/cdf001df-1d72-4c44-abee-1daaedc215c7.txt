The pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid prior to lyophilization .
The contents of the vial are lyophilized and sealed under nitrogen at the time of manufacture .
The pH of the reconstituted product is 4 . 2 to 5 . 7 .
The structure of mebrofenin ( 2 , 2 ' - [ [ 2 - [ ( 3 - Bromo - 2 , 4 , 6 - trimethylphenyl ) - amino ] - 2 - oxoethyl ] imino ] bisacetic acid ) is shown below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Weight = 387 . 23 When sterile , pyrogen - free sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection is added to the vial , the diagnostic agent Technetium Tc 99 m Mebrofenin is formed for administration by intravenous injection .
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS Technetium Tc 99 m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half - life of 6 . 02 hours . 1 The principal photon that is useful for detection and imaging studies is listed in Table 1 .

External Radiation The specific gamma ray constant for Tc 99 m is 0 . 78 R / hour - millicurie at 1 cm .
The first half value layer is 0 . 017 cm of lead ( Pb ) .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2 .
To facilitate control of the radiation exposure from millicurie amounts of this radionuclide , the use of a 0 . 25 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1 , 000 .

Following intravenous administration in normal subjects , Technetium Tc 99 m Mebrofenin was rapidly cleared from the circulation .
The mean percent injected dose remaining in the blood at 10 minutes was 17 % .
The injected activity was cleared through the hepatobiliary system with visualization of the liver by 5 minutes and maximum liver uptake occurring at 11 minutes post - injection .
Hepatic duct and gallbladder visualization occurred by 10 to 15 minutes and intestinal activity was visualized by 30 to 60 minutes in subjects with normal hepatobiliary function .
The mean percent injected dose excreted in the urine during the first 3 hours was 1 % ( 0 . 4 to 2 . 0 % ) .
Elevated serum bilirubin levels increase renal excretion of Tc 99 m HIDA agents .
In two studies in which Tc 99 m Mebrofenin was administered to patients having mean elevated serum bilirubin levels of 9 . 8 mg / dL ( 1 . 7 to 46 . 3 mg / dL ) , the mean percent injected dose excreted in the urine during the first 3 hours was 3 % ( 0 . 2 to 11 . 5 % ) .
The mean percent injected dose excreted in the urine during 3 - 24 hours was 14 . 9 % ( 0 . 4 to 34 . 8 % ) .
In jaundiced patients , the percent injected dose remaining in the blood at 10 minutes may be twice as high or more than the level in normals .
Hepatobiliary transit may be delayed and visualization times increased .
As a consequence , the quality of the images obtained frequently diminishes .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Technetium Tc 99 m Mebrofenin is indicated as a hepatobiliary imaging agent .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to this compound .
WARNINGS The theoretical possibility of allergic reactions should be considered in patients who receive multiple doses .
PRECAUTIONS General Contents of the reaction vial are intended only for use in the preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Mebrofenin and are not to be administered directly to the patient .
Delayed or non - visualization of the gallbladder may occur in the immediate post - prandial period or after prolonged fasting or parenteral feeding .
Functional biliary obstruction may accompany chronic cholecystitis or pancreatitis .
In addition , patients with hepatocellular disease may show nonvisualization or delayed visualization of the gallbladder .
Delayed intestinal transit may also be noted in such patients .
Juvenile hepatitis may be associated with gallbladder nonvisualization and the failure to visualize activity in the intestine .
Administration of meperidine or morphine may delay intestinal transit of the imaging agent and may result in nonvisualization .
Septic patients may show absent or delayed hepatobiliary clearance .
Thus , a positive finding does not of itself permit a differential diagnosis of any of the above conditions and should be evaluated in the light of the total clinical picture and results of other diagnostic modalities .
The components of the kit are supplied sterile and non - pyrogenic .
Aseptic procedures normally employed in making additions and withdrawals from sterile , non - pyrogenic containers should be used during the addition of the pertechnetate solution and the withdrawal of doses for patient administration .
The Technetium Tc 99 m labeling reactions involved in preparing the agent depend on maintaining the stannous ion in the reduced state .
Any oxidant present in the sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m supply may , thus , adversely affect the quality of the radiopharmaceutical .
Hence , sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m containing oxidants should not be employed .
Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides .
As in the use of any radioactive material , care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure to the patient consistent with proper patient management and to ensure minimum radiation exposure to occupational workers .
Tc 99 m Mebrofenin should be formulated no more than 18 hours prior to clinical use .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential or whether Technetium Tc 99 m Mebrofenin may affect fertility in males or females .
Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Technetium Tc 99 m Mebrofenin .
It is also not known whether Technetium Tc 99 m Mebrofenin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity .
Technetium Tc 99 m Mebrofenin should be given to a pregnant woman only if the expected benefits to be gained clearly outweigh the potential hazards .
Nursing Mothers Technetium Tc 99 m is excreted in human milk during lactation .
Therefore , formula feedings should be substituted for breast feedings .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 18 have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Urticaria and rash have been rarely reported with the use of Technetium Tc 99 m Mebrofenin since market introduction .
Rare cases of chills and nausea have been reported with related compounds .
Infrequently , death has been reported in association with the use of this class of agents .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The suggested intravenous dose range of Technetium Tc 99 m Mebrofenin in the average patient ( 70 kg ) is : • • Nonjaundiced patient : 74 - 185 MBq ( 2 - 5 mCi ) • • Patient with serum bilirubin • • level greater than 1 . 5 mg / dL : 111 - 370 MBq ( 3 - 10 mCi ) The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration .
The patient should be in a fasting state , 4 hours is preferable .
False positives ( non - visualization ) may result if the gallbladder has been emptied by ingestion of food .
An interval of at least 24 hours should be allowed before repeat examination .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
RADIATION DOSIMETRY The estimated absorbed radiation doses1 , 2 to organs and tissues of an average subject ( 70 kg ) from an intravenous injection of 370 MBq ( 10 millicuries ) of Technetium Tc 99 m Mebrofenin are shown in Table 4 .
