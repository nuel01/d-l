Anaphylactic reactions to synthetic GnRH or GnRH agonist analogs have been reported in the literature .
• Known hypersensitivity to GnRH , GnRH agonist analogs or any of the components of ELIGARD ® ( 4 . 1 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Tumor Flare : Transient increase in serum levels of testosterone during treatment may result in worsening of symptoms or onset of new signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment , including bone pain , neuropathy , hematuria , bladder outlet obstruction , ureteral obstruction , or spinal cord compression .
Monitor patients at risk closely and manage as appropriate .
( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) • Hyperglycemia and diabetes : Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH analogs .
Monitor blood glucose level and manage according to current clinical practice .
( 5 . 3 ) • Cardiovascular diseases : Increased risk of myocardial infarction , sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in men .
Monitor for cardiovascular disease and manage according to current clinical practice .
( 5 . 4 ) • Effect on QT / QTc Interval : Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval .
Consider risks and benefits .
( 5 . 5 ) • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : May cause fetal harm .
( 5 . 6 , 8 . 1 ) • Convulsions have been observed in patients with or without a history of predisposing factors .
Manage convulsions according to the current clinical practice .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Tumor Flare ELIGARD ® 7 . 5 mg 22 . 5 mg 30 mg , like other GnRH agonists , causes a transient increase in serum concentrations of testosterone during the first week of treatment .
ELIGARD ® 45 mg causes a transient increase in serum concentrations of testosterone during the first two weeks of treatment .
Patients may experience worsening of symptoms or onset of new signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment , including bone pain , neuropathy , hematuria , or bladder outlet obstruction .
Cases of ureteral obstruction and / or spinal cord compression , which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications , have been observed in the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer using GnRH agonists .
Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and / or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy .
If spinal cord compression or ureteral obstruction develops , standard treatment of these complications should be instituted .
5 . 2 Laboratory Tests Response to ELIGARD ® should be monitored by periodic measurement of serum concentrations of testosterone and prostate specific antigen .
In the majority of patients , testosterone levels increased above Baseline during the first week , declining thereafter to Baseline levels or below by the end of the second or third week .
Castrate levels were generally reached within two to four weeks .
Castrate testosterone levels were maintained for the duration of the treatment with ELIGARD ® 7 . 5 mg .
No increases to above the castrate level occurred in any of the patients .
Castrate levels were generally maintained for the duration of treatment with ELIGARD ® 22 . 5 mg .
Once castrate levels were achieved with ELIGARD ® 30 mg , most ( 86 / 89 ) patients remained suppressed throughout the study .
Once castrate levels were achieved with ELIGARD ® 45 mg , only one patient ( < 1 % ) experienced a breakthrough , with testosterone levels > 50 ng / dL .
Results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology .
It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions .
Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions : Therapy with leuprolide acetate results in suppression of the pituitary - gonadal system .
Results of diagnostic tests of pituitary gonadotropic and gonadal functions conducted during and after leuprolide therapy may be affected .
5 . 3 Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists .
Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes .
Monitor blood glucose and / or glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes .
5 . 4 Cardiovascular Diseases Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction , sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men .
The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios , and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer .
Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice .
5 . 5 Effect on QT / QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT / QTc interval .
Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , frequent electrolyte abnormalities , and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval .
Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected .
Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes .
5 . 6 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action , leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In animal developmental and reproductive studies , major fetal abnormalities were observed after administration of leuprolide acetate throughout gestation in rats .
Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 7 Convulsions Postmarketing reports of convulsions have been observed in patients on leuprolide acetate therapy .
These included patients with a history of seizures , epilepsy , cerebrovascular disorders , central nervous system anomalies or tumors , and in patients on concomitant medications that have been associated with convulsions such as bupropion and SSRIs .
Convulsions have also been reported in patients in the absence of any of the conditions mentioned above .
Patients receiving a GnRH agonist who experience convulsion should be managed according to current clinical practice .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS • Most common adverse reactions in clinical studies ( incidence ≥ 5 % ) : Malaise , fatigue , hot flashes / sweats , and testicular atrophy .
( 6 . 1 ) • As with other GnRH agonists , other adverse reactions , including decreased bone density and rare cases of pituitary apoplexy have been reported .

6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience The safety of all ELIGARD ® formulations was evaluated in clinical trials involving patients with advanced prostate cancer .
In addition , the safety of ELIGARD ® 7 . 5 mg was evaluated in 8 surgically castrated males ( Table 5 ) .
ELIGARD ® , like other GnRH analogs , caused a transient increase in serum testosterone concentrations during the first one to two weeks of treatment .
Therefore , potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms of the disease during the first weeks of treatment are of concern in patients with vertebral metastases and / or urinary obstruction or hematuria .
If these conditions are aggravated , it may lead to neurological problems such as weakness and / or paresthesia of the lower limbs or worsening of urinary symptoms [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
During the clinical trials , injection sites were closely monitored .
Refer to Table 4 for a summary of reported injection site events .

10 OVERDOSAGE In clinical trials using daily subcutaneous injections of leuprolide acetate in patients with prostate cancer , doses as high as 20 mg / day for up to two years caused no adverse effects differing from those observed with the 1 mg / day dose .
11 DESCRIPTION ELIGARD ® is a sterile polymeric matrix formulation of leuprolide acetate , a GnRH agonist , for subcutaneous injection .
It is designed to deliver leuprolide acetate at a controlled rate over a one - , three - , four - or six - month therapeutic period .
Leuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin releasing hormone ( GnRH ) that , when given continuously , inhibits pituitary gonadotropin secretion and suppresses testicular and ovarian steroidogenesis .
The analog possesses greater potency than the natural hormone .
The chemical name is 5 - oxo - L - prolyl - L - histidyl - L - tryptophyl - L - seryl - L - tyrosyl - D - leucyl - L - leucyl - L - arginyl - N - ethyl - L - prolinamide acetate ( salt ) with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] ELIGARD ® is prefilled and supplied in two separate , sterile syringes whose contents are mixed immediately prior to administration .
The two syringes are joined and the single dose product is mixed until it is homogenous .
ELIGARD ® is administered subcutaneously , where it forms a solid drug delivery depot .
One syringe contains the ATRIGEL ® Delivery System and the other contains leuprolide acetate .
ATRIGEL ® is a polymeric ( non - gelatin containing ) delivery system consisting of a biodegradable poly ( DL - lactide - co - glycolide ) ( PLGH or PLG ) polymer formulation dissolved in a biocompatible solvent , N - methyl - 2 - pyrrolidone ( NMP ) .

Animal and human studies indicate that after an initial stimulation , chronic administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of testicular and ovarian steroidogenesis .
This effect is reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy .
In humans , administration of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids ( testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males , and estrone and estradiol in premenopausal females ) .
However , continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH .
In males , testosterone is reduced to below castrate threshold ( ≤ 50 ng / dL ) .
These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment .
Long - term studies have shown that continuation of therapy with leuprolide acetate maintains testosterone below the castrate level for up to seven years .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Following the first dose of ELIGARD ® , mean serum testosterone concentrations transiently increased , then fell to below castrate threshold ( ≤ 50 ng / dL ) within three weeks for all ELIGARD ® concentrations .
Continued monthly treatment with ELIGARD ® 7 . 5 mg maintained castrate testosterone suppression throughout the study .
No breakthrough of testosterone concentrations above castrate threshold ( > 50 ng / dL ) occurred at any time during the study once castrate suppression was achieved ( Figure 1 ) .
One patient received less than a full dose of ELIGARD ® 22 . 5 mg at baseline , never suppressed and withdrew from the study at Day 73 .
Of the 116 patients remaining in the study , 115 ( 99 % ) had serum testosterone levels below the castrate threshold by Month 1 ( Day 28 ) .
By Day 35 , 116 ( 100 % ) had serum testosterone levels below the castrate threshold .
Once testosterone suppression was achieved , one patient ( < 1 % ) demonstrated breakthrough ( concentrations > 50 ng / dL after achieving castrate levels ) following the initial injection ; that patient remained below the castrate threshold following the second injection ( Figure 2 ) .
One patient withdrew from the ELIGARD ® 30 mg study at Day 14 .
Of the 89 patients remaining in the study , 85 ( 96 % ) had serum testosterone levels below the castrate threshold by Month 1 ( Day 28 ) .
By Day 42 , 89 ( 100 % ) of patients attained castrate testosterone suppression .
Once castrate testosterone suppression was achieved , three patients ( 3 % ) demonstrated breakthrough ( concentrations > 50 ng / dL after achieving castrate levels ) ( Figure 3 ) .
One patient at Day 1 and another patient at Day 29 were withdrawn from the ELIGARD ® 45 mg study .
Of the 109 patients remaining in the study , 108 ( 99 . 1 % ) had serum testosterone levels below the castrate threshold by Month 1 ( Day 28 ) .
One patient did not achieve castrate suppression and was withdrawn from the study at Day 85 .
Once castrate testosterone suppression was achieved , one patient ( < 1 % ) demonstrated breakthrough ( concentrations > 50 ng / dL after achieving castrate levels ) ( Figure 4 ) .
Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption ELIGARD ® 7 . 5 mg The pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics observed during three once - monthly injections in 20 patients with advanced prostate cancer is shown in Figure 1 .
Mean serum leuprolide concentrations following the initial injection rose to 25 . 3 ng / mL ( Cmax ) at approximately 5 hours after injection .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Two - year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice .
In rats , a dose - related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses ( 0 . 6 to 4 mg / kg ) .
There was a significant but not dose - related increase of pancreatic islet - cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males ( highest incidence in the low dose group ) .
In mice , no leuprolide acetate - induced tumors or pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg / kg for two years .
Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg / day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg / day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities .
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with ELIGARD ® .
Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems and with ELIGARD ® 7 . 5 mg in bacterial systems .
These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES One open - label , multicenter study was conducted with each ELIGARD ® formulation ( 7 . 5 mg , 22 . 5 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg ) in patients with Jewett stage A though D prostate cancer who were treated with at least a single injection of study drug ( Table 8 ) .
These studies evaluated the achievement and maintenance of castrate serum testosterone suppression over the duration of therapy ( Figures 5 - 8 ) .
During the AGL9904 study using ELIGARD ® 7 . 5 mg , once testosterone suppression was achieved , no patients ( 0 % ) demonstrated breakthrough ( concentration > 50 ng / dL ) at any time in the study .
During the AGL9909 study using ELIGARD ® 22 . 5 mg , once testosterone suppression was achieved , only one patient ( < 1 % ) demonstrated breakthrough following the initial injection ; that patient remained below the castrate threshold following the second injection .
During the AGL0001 study using ELIGARD ® 30 mg , once testosterone suppression was achieved , three patients ( 3 % ) demonstrated breakthrough .
In the first of these patients , a single serum testosterone concentration of 53 ng / dL was reported on the day after the second injection .
In this patient , castrate suppression was reported for all other time points .
In the second patient , a serum testosterone concentration of 66 ng / dL was reported immediately prior to the second injection .
This rose to a maximum concentration of 147 ng / dL on the second day after the second injection .
In this patient , castrate suppression was again reached on the seventh day after the second injection and was maintained thereafter .
In the final patient , serum testosterone concentrations > 50 ng / dL were reported at 2 and at 8 hours after the second injection .
Serum testosterone concentration rose to a maximum of 110 ng / dL on the third day after the second injection .
In this patient , castrate suppression was again reached eighteen days after the second injection and was maintained until the final day of the study , when a single serum testosterone concentration of 55 ng / dL was reported .
During the AGL0205 study using ELIGARD ® 45 mg , once testosterone suppression was achieved , one patient ( < 1 % ) demonstrated breakthrough .
This patient reached castrate suppression at Day 21 and remained suppressed until Day 308 when his testosterone level rose to 112 ng / dL .
At Month 12 ( Day 336 ) , his testosterone was 210 ng / dL .
