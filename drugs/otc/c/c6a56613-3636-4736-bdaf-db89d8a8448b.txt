Oxford : Pergamon Press ; 1998 ] The Effective Dose resulting from a Ioflupane I 123 Injection administration with an administered activity of 185 MBq ( 5 mCi ) is 3 . 94 mSv in an adult .
2 . 6 Imaging Instructions Begin SPECT imaging 3 hours to 6 hours following Ioflupane I 123 Injection administration .
Use a gamma camera fitted with high - resolution collimators and set to a photopeak of 159 keV with a ± 10 % energy window .
Angular sampling should be at least 120 views over 360 degrees .
Position the patient supine with the head on an off - the - table headrest , use a flexible head restraint such as a strip of tape across the chin or forehead if necessary to help avoid movement , and set a circular orbit for the detector heads with the radius as small as possible ( typically 11 cm to 15 cm ) .
Obtain images with matrix size and zoom factors selected to give a pixel size of 3 . 5 mm to 4 . 5 mm .
Collect a minimum of 1 . 5 million counts for optimal images .
2 . 7 Image Interpretation Interpret Ioflupane I 123 Injection images visually , based upon the appearance of the striata .
Reconstructed pixel size should be between 3 . 5 mm and 4 . 5 mm with slices 1 pixel thick .
Optimum presentation of the reconstructed images for visual interpretation is transaxial slices parallel to the anterior commissure - posterior commissure ( AC - PC ) line .
Determine whether an image is normal or abnormal by assessing the extent ( as indicated by shape ) and intensity of the striatal signal .
Image interpretation does not involve integration of the striatal image appearance with clinical signs and / or symptoms .
Normal : In transaxial images , normal images are characterized by two symmetric comma - or crescent - shaped focal regions of activity mirrored about the median plane .
Striatal activity is distinct , relative to surrounding brain tissue ( Figure 1 ) .
Abnormal : Abnormal Ioflupane I 123 Injection images fall into at least one of the following three categories ( all are considered abnormal ) .
• Activity is asymmetric , e . g . , activity in the region of the putamen of one hemisphere is absent or greatly reduced with respect to the other .
Activity is still visible in the caudate nuclei of both hemispheres resulting in a comma or crescent shape in one and a circular or oval focus in the other .
There may be reduced activity between at least one striatum and surrounding tissues ( Figure 2 ) .
• Activity is absent in the putamen of both hemispheres and confined to the caudate nuclei .
Activity is relatively symmetric and forms two roughly circular or oval foci .
Activity of one or both is generally reduced ( Figure 3 ) .
• Activity is absent in the putamen of both hemispheres and greatly reduced in one or both caudate nuclei .
Activity of the striata with respect to the background is reduced ( Figure 4 ) .

( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Advise a lactating woman to interrupt breastfeeding and pump and discard breastmilk for at least 6 days after Ioflupane I 123 Injection administration .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Radioactive iodine products cross the placenta and can permanently impair fetal thyroid function .
Administration of an appropriate thyroid blocking agent is recommended before use of Ioflupane I 123 Injection in a pregnant woman to protect the woman and fetus from accumulation of iodine - 123 [ seeDosageand Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
There are no available data on Ioflupane I 123 Injection use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ioflupane I - 123 .
All radiopharmaceuticals have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose .
Administration of Ioflupane I 123 Injection at a dose of 185 MBq ( 5 mCi ) results in an absorbed radiation dose to the uterus of 0 . 3 rad ( 3 . 0 mGy ) .
Radiation doses greater than 15 rad ( 150 mGy ) have been associated with congenital anomalies but doses under 5 rad ( 50 mGy ) generally have not .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risks of fetal exposure to radiation doses with administration of Ioflupane I 123 Injection .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population ( s ) is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .

11 DESCRIPTION [ MULTIMEDIA ] 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics Ioflupane I 123 Injection is a sterile , pyrogen - free radioactive diagnostic agent for intravenous use .
Ioflupane I 123 Injection is a clear and colorless solution is supplied in single - dose vials .
Each milliliter contains 0 . 07 to 0 . 13 mcg ioflupane , 74 MBq ( 2 mCi ) of iodine - 123 ( as ioflupane I - 123 ) at calibration time , 5 . 7 mg acetic acid , 7 . 8 mg sodium acetate and 0 . 05 mL ( 5 % ) ethanol .
The pH of the solution is between 4 . 2 and 5 . 2 .
The chemical name for ioflupane I - 123 is N - ω - fluoropropyl - 2β - carbomethoxy - 3β - ( 4 - [ 123 I ] iodophenyl ) nortropane and it has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] 11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Iodine - 123 is a cyclotron - produced radionuclide that decays to tellurium - 123 by electron capture and has a physical half - life of 13 . 2 hours .
The photon that is useful for detection and imaging studies is listed in Table 2 .
Table 2 Principal Radiation Emission Data – Iodine - 123 Radiation Energy Level ( keV ) Abundance ( % ) Gamma 159 83 11 . 3 External Radiation The specific gamma - ray constant for iodine - 123 is 1 . 6 R / mCi - hr at 1 cm .
The first half - value thickness of lead ( Pb ) for iodine - 123 is 0 . 04 cm .
The relative transmission of radiation emitted by the radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 3 ( e . g . , the use of 2 . 16 cm Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of about 1 , 000 ) .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The active drug substance in Ioflupane I 123 Injection is N - ω - fluoropropyl - 2β - carbomethoxy - 3β - ( 4 - [ 123 I ] iodophenyl ) nortropane or ioflupane I - 123 .
In vitro , ioflupane binds reversibly to the human dopamine transporter ( DaT ) ( Ki = 0 . 62 nM ; IC50 = 0 . 71 nM ) .
Autoradiography of post - mortem human brain slices exposed to radiolabeled ioflupane shows concentration of the radiolabel in striatum ( caudate nucleus and putamen ) .
The specificity of the binding of ioflupane I - 125 to dopamine transporter was demonstrated by competition studies with the DaT inhibitor GBR 12909 ( a dopamine reuptake inhibitor ) , the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram , and the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor desipramine in post - mortem human brain slices exposed to radiolabeled ioflupane .
Citalopram reduced binding in the neocortex and thalamus with only minor effects in the striatum .
This indicated that the binding in the cortex and thalamus is mainly to the serotonin reuptake sites .
Desipramine showed no effect on the level of striatal binding of ioflupane I - 125 , but reduced extrastriatal binding by 60 to 85 % .
The binding of ioflupane I - 125 to the striatum was abolished in the presence of high concentrations of GBR 12909 , indicating selectivity of ioflupane binding for the pre - synaptic DaT .
Following administration of Ioflupane I 123 Injection to humans , radioactive decay of the iodine - 123 emits gamma radiation which can be detected externally using gamma detectors , allowing visualization of the brain striata through SPECT imaging [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics As Ioflupane I 123 Injection contains a very small quantity of ioflupane , no ioflupane pharmacologic effects are expected [ see Description ( 11 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of ioflupane I - 123 were studied by monitoring radioactivity following intravenous injection ; only 5 % of the administered radioactivity remained in whole blood at 5 minutes post - injection .
Uptake in the brain reached approximately 7 % of injected radioactivity at 10 minutes post - injection and decreased to 3 % after 5 hours ; striata to background ratios were relatively constant between 3 hours and 6 hours post - injection .
About 30 % of the whole brain radioactivity was attributed to striatal uptake .
By 48 hours post - injection , approximately 60 % of the injected radioactivity has been excreted in the urine , with fecal excretion estimated to be approximately 14 % .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies on reproductive toxicity have not been conducted .
Ioflupane showed no evidence of mutagenic potential in in vitro or in vivo mutagenicity studies .
Studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ioflupane have not been performed .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Single - and repeated - dose intravenous toxicity studies have been performed using ioflupane in rats , rabbits , and dogs .
Additionally , single - dose acute toxicity studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys .
No mortality or other toxicity was observed at doses up to 5 , 500 times the maximum clinical dose of Ioflupane I 123 Injection ; at doses greater than 1 , 500 times the maximum clinical dose , pharmacological responses such as mydriasis and hyperactivity were seen in some species .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Suspected Parkinsonian Syndromes The safety and efficacy of Ioflupane I 123 Injection were evaluated in two multicenter , single - arm , open - label studies ( Study 1 and Study 2 ) that enrolled 284 adult patients with suspected PS .
In these studies , Ioflupane I 123 Injection image interpretation was compared to a reference clinical diagnostic standard of " PS " or " non - PS " .
PS consisted of Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) , multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) , and progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) .
These conditions have been associated with dopaminergic neurodegeneration and Ioflupane I 123 Injection imaging was not designed to distinguish among the conditions .
Among the non - PS population , subjects with a history of the following conditions were included : vascular parkinsonism , psychogenic parkinsonism , essential tremor ( ET ) , various forms of tremor , and other non - PS diagnoses ; Ioflupane I 123 Injection imaging was not designed to distinguish among these conditions .
Patients underwent SPECT imaging with a variety of multi - headed cameras or multi - detector single - slice systems 3 to 6 hours after Ioflupane I 123 Injection administration .
The Ioflupane I 123 Injection activity in these two clinical studies ranged from 111 MBq to 201 MBq ( 3 mCi to 5 . 4 mCi ) [ median 167 . 8 MBq ( 4 . 5 mCi ) ] .
Readers blinded to clinical information interpreted Ioflupane I 123 Injection imaging as normal or abnormal [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] .
A normal image is inconsistent with clinical conditions associated with PS and an abnormal image is consistent with clinical conditions associated with PS .
Study 1 consisted of 99 patients with early features of Parkinsonism ; patients with features suggestive of MSA or PSP were excluded .
The baseline clinical diagnoses consisted of : probable PD ( 44 % ) , possible PD ( 31 % ) , “ benign ” PD ( 6 % ) , possible ET ( 11 % ) , and other diagnoses ( 7 % ) .
The patients were 44 % female , 42 % of age 65 years or over , and all were White .
Study 1 readers had no other role in patient assessment .
The reference clinical diagnostic standard consisted of the clinical diagnoses established by a consensus panel of movement disorder specialists that evaluated data inclusive through 36 months of follow - up .
Study 2 consisted of 185 patients with clinically established diagnosis of PS ( PD , MSA , PSP ) or ET .
The baseline clinical diagnoses consisted of : PD ( 70 % ) , MSA ( 10 % ) , PSP ( 5 % ) , and ET ( 15 % ) .
The patients were 35 % female , 48 % of age 65 years or over , and 99 % were White .
Study 2 readers included site investigators .
The reference clinical diagnostic standard consisted of the investigator - determined baseline clinical diagnosis .
Table 4 shows the positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of the Ioflupane I 123 Injection image results with the reference clinical diagnostic standard .
Positive percent agreement represents the percent of patients with abnormal Ioflupane I 123 Injection images among all the patients with a clinical diagnostic reference standard of PS .
Negative percent agreement represents the percent of patients with normal Ioflupane I 123 Injection images among the patients with a non - PS clinical diagnostic reference standard .

In 55 patients clinically diagnosed with DLB or with Alzheimer ’ s disease , the results of consensus blinded visual assessment of the Ioflupane I 123 Injection images were compared to neuropathological diagnosis made using standard international criteria at autopsy .
The patients were 38 % female and of ages 63 to 95 years ( mean 77 years ) at the time of Ioflupane I 123 Injection imaging .
The median administered Ioflupane I 123 Injection activity was 150 MBq to 185 MBq ( 4 . 1 mCi to 4 . 9 mCi ) .
Ioflupane I 123 Injection images were rated as normal or abnormal [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] .
Based on autopsy diagnosis , the sensitivity and specificity of Ioflupane I 123 Injection for DLB was 80 % ( 95 % CI 61 % to 92 % ) and 92 % ( 95 % CI 74 % to 99 % ) , respectively .
The effectiveness of Ioflupane I 123 Injection as a screening or confirmatory test and for monitoring disease progression or response to therapy has not been established .
