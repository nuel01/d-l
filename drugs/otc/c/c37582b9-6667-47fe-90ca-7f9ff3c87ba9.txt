( 5 . 6 ) • Cardiac adverse reactions : Discontinue in case of serious or life - threatening events .
( 5 . 7 ) • Renal toxicity : Discontinue in patients with rising serum creatinine or oliguria .
( 5 . 8 ) • Bowel obstruction and perforation : Consider and evaluate for abdominal pain , vomiting , or related symptoms .
( 5 . 9 ) • Immunizations : Live virus vaccinations prior to or during treatment not recommended .
( 5 . 10 ) • Embryo - Fetal toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception .
( 5 . 11 ) 5 . 1 Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions Mucocutaneous reactions , some with fatal outcome , can occur in patients treated with rituximab - containing products , including RITUXAN HYCELA .
These reactions include paraneoplastic pemphigus , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , lichenoid dermatitis , vesiculobullous dermatitis , and toxic epidermal necrolysis .
Discontinue RITUXAN HYCELA in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction .
The safety of re - administration of a rituximab - containing product , including RITUXAN HYCELA , to patients with severe mucocutaneous reactions has not been determined .
5 . 2 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) reactivation , in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis , hepatic failure and death , can occur in patients treated with drugs classified as CD20 - directed cytolytic antibodies , including rituximab - containing products .
HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA levels or detection of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative and anti - HBc positive .
Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis , i . e . , increase in transaminase levels .
In severe cases increase in bilirubin levels , liver failure , and death can occur .
Screen all patients for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti - HBc before initiating treatment with a rituximab - containing product .
For patients who show evidence of prior hepatitis B infection ( HBsAg positive [ regardless of antibody status ] or HBsAg negative but anti - HBc positive ) , consult with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral therapy before and / or during treatment with a rituximab - containing product .
Monitor patients with evidence of current or prior HBV infection for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation during and for several months following RITUXAN HYCELA .
HBV reactivation has been reported up to 24 months following completion of therapy containing rituximab .
In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on RITUXAN HYCELA , immediately discontinue treatment and any concomitant chemotherapy , and institute appropriate treatment .
Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of resuming RITUXAN HYCELA treatment in patients who develop HBV reactivation .
Resumption of RITUXAN HYCELA treatment in patients whose HBV reactivation resolves should be discussed with physicians with expertise in managing HBV .
5 . 3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) JC virus infection resulting in PML and death has been observed in patients receiving rituximab - containing products , including RITUXAN HYCELA .
Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new - onset neurologic manifestations .
Evaluation of PML includes , but is not limited to , consultation with a neurologist , brain MRI , and lumbar puncture .
Discontinue RITUXAN HYCELA and consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 4 Hypersensitivity and other Administration Reactions Systemic Reactions Patients must receive at least one full dose of a rituximab product by intravenous infusion before receiving RITUXAN HYCELA due to the higher risk of hypersensitivity and other acute reactions during the first infusion [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Beginning therapy with a rituximab product by intravenous infusion allows management of hypersensitivity and other administration reactions by slowing or stopping the intravenous infusion .
Rituximab - containing products , including RITUXAN HYCELA , are associated with hypersensitivity and other administration reactions , which may be related to release of cytokines and / or other chemical mediators .
Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable from acute hypersensitivity reactions .
This set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release , tumor lysis syndrome and anaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below .
They are not specifically related to the route of administration of a rituximab - containing product .
Severe infusion - related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported with the use of intravenous formulations of rituximab products , with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after starting the first intravenous infusion .
They were characterized by pulmonary events in addition to fever , chills , rigors , hypotension , urticaria , angioedema and other symptoms .
Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions can also occur .
In contrast to cytokine release syndrome , true hypersensitivity reactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion .
Severe cytokine release syndrome is characterized by severe dyspnea , often associated by bronchospasm and hypoxia , in addition to fever , chills , rigors , urticaria , and angioedema .
This syndrome may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Cytokine release syndrome may occur within 1 – 2 hours of initiating the infusion .
Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with pulmonary tumor infiltration may be at a greater risk of poor outcome .
Rituximab product administration should be interrupted immediately and aggressive symptomatic treatment initiated .
During RITUXAN HYCELA administration , the injection should be interrupted immediately when observing signs of a severe reaction and aggressive symptomatic treatment should be initiated .
Closely monitor the following patients : those with pre - existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions , those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions , and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells ( ≥ 25 , 000 / mm3 ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 , 5 . 7 ) ] .
Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to each administration of RITUXAN HYCELA [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Premedication with glucocorticoids should also be considered .
Observe patients for at least 15 minutes following RITUXAN HYCELA .
A longer period may be appropriate in patients with an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions .
Local Cutaneous Reactions Local cutaneous reactions , including injection site reactions , have been reported in patients receiving RITUXAN HYCELA .
Symptoms included pain , swelling , induration , hemorrhage , erythema , pruritus , and rash [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Some local cutaneous reactions occurred more than 24 hours after RITUXAN HYCELA administration .
The incidence of local cutaneous reactions following administration of RITUXAN HYCELA was 16 % .
Reactions were mild or moderate and resolved without any specific treatment .
Local cutaneous reactions of any Grade were most common during the first RITUXAN HYCELA cycle ( Cycle 2 ; 5 % ) with the incidence decreasing with subsequent injections .
5 . 5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome ( TLS ) TLS can occur within 12 – 24 hours after administration of a rituximab - containing product , including RITUXAN HYCELA .
A high number of circulating malignant cells ( ≥ 25 , 000 / mm3 ) or high tumor burden confers a greater risk of TLS .
Administer aggressive intravenous hydration and anti - hyperuricemic therapy in patients at high risk for TLS .
Correct electrolyte abnormalities , monitor renal function and fluid balance , and administer supportive care , including dialysis as indicated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
5 . 6 Infections Serious , including fatal , bacterial , fungal , and new or reactivated viral infections can occur during and following the completion of therapy with rituximab - containing products , including RITUXAN HYCELA .
The incidence of infections with RITUXAN HYCELA vs rituximab was 56 % and 49 % respectively in patients with CLL , and 46 % and 41 % respectively in patients with FL / DLBCL in combination with chemotherapy .
Infections have been reported in some patients with prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia ( defined as hypogammaglobulinemia > 11 months after rituximab exposure ) .
New or reactivated viral infections included cytomegalovirus , herpes simplex virus , parvovirus B19 , varicella zoster virus , West Nile virus , and hepatitis B and C . Discontinue RITUXAN HYCELA for serious infections and institute appropriate anti - infective therapy [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 7 Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions Cardiac adverse reactions , including ventricular fibrillation , myocardial infarction , and cardiogenic shock may occur with rituximab - containing products , including RITUXAN HYCELA .
Discontinue RITUXAN HYCELA for serious or life threatening cardiac arrhythmias .
Perform cardiac monitoring during and after all administrations of RITUXAN HYCELA for patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias , or who have a history of arrhythmia or angina [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 8 Renal Toxicity Severe , including fatal , renal toxicity can occur after administration of rituximab - containing products , including RITUXAN HYCELA .
Renal toxicity has occurred in patients who experience tumor lysis syndrome and in patients with administered concomitant cisplatin therapy during clinical trials .
The combination of cisplatin and RITUXAN HYCELA is not an approved treatment regimen .
Monitor closely for signs of renal failure and discontinue RITUXAN HYCELA in patients with a rising serum creatinine or oliguria [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
5 . 9 Bowel Obstruction and Perforation Abdominal pain , bowel obstruction and perforation , in some cases leading to death , can occur in patients receiving rituximab - containing products , including RITUXAN HYCELA , in combination with chemotherapy .
In postmarketing reports , the mean time to documented gastrointestinal perforation was 6 ( range 1 – 77 ) days .
Evaluate if symptoms of obstruction such as abdominal pain or repeated vomiting occur .
5 . 10 Immunization The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following rituximab - containing products , including RITUXAN HYCELA , therapy has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment .
5 . 11 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on human data , rituximab - containing products can cause fetal harm due to B - cell lymphocytopenia in infants exposed to rituximab in - utero .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with RITUXAN HYCELA and for 12 months after the last dose of rituximab - containing products , including RITUXAN HYCELA [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The data described below reflect exposure to RITUXAN HYCELA in 892 patients in four controlled trials with exposures ranging from a single injection up to 27 months of treatment .
The population included 382 patients with follicular lymphoma ( FL ) , 369 patients with diffuse large B - cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , and 141 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) .
The median age was 60 years ( range : 18 – 85 years , 53 % were male , and 84 % were White .
In the SABRINA study patients with FL received a full dose of a rituximab product by intravenous infusion , followed by RITUXAN HYCELA ( 1 , 400 mg rituximab / 23 , 400 Units hyaluronidase human ) , in combination with chemotherapy for up to 7 doses ( i . e . , total of 8 doses in combination with chemotherapy ) , or as monotherapy for up to 12 doses ( maintenance treatment ) .
In the MabEase study patients with DLBCL received a full dose of a rituximab product by intravenous infusion , followed by RITUXAN HYCELA ( 1 , 400 mg rituximab / 23 , 400 Units hyaluronidase human ) , given in combination with chemotherapy for up to 7 doses ( i . e . , up to a total of 8 doses ) .
In the SAWYER study patients with CLL on part 2 received a full dose of a rituximab product by intravenous infusion , followed by RITUXAN HYCELA ( 1 , 600 mg rituximab / 26 , 800 Units hyaluronidase human ) for up to 5 doses , in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide ( i . e . , total of 6 doses ) .
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 20 % ) of RITUXAN HYCELA observed in patients with FL on the SABRINA study were : infections , neutropenia , nausea , constipation , cough , and fatigue .
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 20 % ) of RITUXAN HYCELA observed in patients with DLBCL on the MabEase study were : infections , neutropenia , alopecia , nausea , and anemia .
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 20 % ) of RITUXAN HYCELA observed in patients with CLL on part 2 of the SAWYER study were : infections , neutropenia , nausea , thrombocytopenia , pyrexia , vomiting , and injection site erythema .
Administration - related reactions ( ARRs ) Administration - related reactions ( ARRs ) with RITUXAN HYCELA were defined as all the adverse reactions related to the administration of RITUXAN HYCELA within the 24 hours post injection .
The incidence of ARRs with RITUXAN HYCELA was 34 % in FL / DLBCL in combination with chemotherapy with injection site erythema ( 5 % ) , chills ( 3 % ) , dyspnea , erythema , flushing , injection site pain , nausea , pruritus , pyrexia , rash , and throat irritation ( 2 % each ) being the most common ARRs .
The incidence of ARRs in FL maintenance setting was 20 % .
The most common ARRs were injection site erythema ( 7 % ) , erythema ( 4 % ) , injection site pain / edema , myalgia , and rash ( 2 % each ) .
The incidence of ARRs with RITUXAN HYCELA in CLL was 44 % .
With the exception of Local Cutaneous Reactions , the incidence and profile of adverse reactions reported for RITUXAN HYCELA were comparable with those for rituximab .
The overall incidence of adverse reactions for intravenous rituximab versus RITUXAN HYCELA in combination with chemotherapy for FL / DLBCL was 93 % versus 95 % ( BSA ≤ 1 . 73 m2 ) , 89 % versus 93 % ( 1 . 73 < BSA ≤ 1 . 92 m2 ) , and 94 % versus 94 % ( BSA > 1 . 92 m2 ) .
The overall incidence of adverse reactions for rituximab versus RITUXAN HYCELA in CLL was 89 % versus 100 % ( BSA ≤ 1 . 81 m2 ) , 97 % versus 88 % ( 1 . 82 < BSA ≤ 1 . 99 m2 ) , and 88 % versus 93 % ( BSA > 2 . 00 m2 ) .
Summary of Clinical Trial Experience in Follicular Lymphoma ( FL ) The data in Table 1 were obtained in the SABRINA study , a two - stage randomized , controlled study in patients with previously untreated FL .
The study compared patients receiving RITUXAN HYCELA ( 1 , 400 mg rituximab / 23 , 400 Units hyaluronidase human ; n = 197 ) with patients receiving a rituximab product by intravenous infusion ( 375 mg / m2 ; n = 210 ) , both in combination with CHOP or CVP followed by maintenance treatment with RITUXAN HYCELA or a rituximab product by intravenous infusion .
The majority of patients completed all 8 cycles of combination treatment with chemotherapy ( 91 % RITUXAN HYCELA vs . 90 % rituximab ) .
In addition , 69 % of patients in each of the treatment groups completed all 20 cycles of combination plus maintenance treatment .
In both RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab groups , patients experienced similar median duration of exposure ( 27 . 1 months for each arm ) .
Across the two stages , the overall demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups .
However , there were more female patients ( 53 % ) randomized in the study than male patients ( 47 % ) and a higher proportion of females were randomized to receive RITUXAN HYCELA ( 59 % female ) compared with the rituximab group ( 48 % ) .
The treatment groups in the combined Stage 1 and 2 population were otherwise balanced in regard to baseline demographics , characterized by a median age of 57 years ( 56 . 0 years [ range 28 – 85 years ] for RITUXAN HYCELA and 57 years [ range 28 – 86 years ] for rituximab ) and median BSA of 1 . 83 m2 ( 1 . 80 and 1 . 84 m2 for RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab , respectively ) .
The incidence of all adverse reactions was 96 % for RITUXAN HYCELA vs . 95 % for rituximab ( Table 1 ) .
Grade 3 – 4 adverse reactions were reported in 55 % of patients receiving RITUXAN HYCELA vs . 53 % in patients receiving rituximab .
Serious adverse reactions were reported in 37 % of patients receiving RITUXAN HYCELA vs . 34 % of patients receiving rituximab .
The most common adverse reactions ( occurring in ≥ 20 % of patients in any arm ) were infections , neutropenia , nausea , constipation , cough , and fatigue .
A total of 36 patients died , including 14 / 197 patients ( 7 % ) who received RITUXAN HYCELA and 22 / 210 patients ( 10 % ) who received rituximab .
Of these 36 patients , 19 patients ( 7 patients RITUXAN HYCELA [ 4 % ] vs . 12 patients rituximab [ 6 % ] ) died due to adverse reactions and 13 patients ( 6 patients RITUXAN HYCELA [ 3 % ] vs . 7 patients rituximab [ 3 % ] ) died due to disease progression .
The incidence of administration - related reactions ( ARRs ) due to the subcutaneous route of administration associated with RITUXAN HYCELA was assessed in combination with chemotherapy and during maintenance .
Thirty patients ( 15 % ) experienced an ARR during the first administration of RITUXAN HYCELA ( Cycle 2 ) .
Incidence of ARRs generally decreased at subsequent cycles with 18 patients ( 9 % ) reporting ARR at Cycle 3 , 13 patients ( 7 % ) at Cycle 4 , 11 patients ( 6 % ) at Cycles 5 and 6 , 12 patients ( 7 % ) at Cycle 7 , and 8 patients ( 4 % ) at Cycle 8 .
During RITUXAN HYCELA monotherapy in the maintenance setting the incidence of ARRs at each cycle was ≤ 7 % and was observed in 24 patients ( 14 % ) overall .
Grade 1 – 2 ARRs constituted 96 % of the overall ARRs .
Grade 3 ARRs were reported during the first administration of RITUXAN HYCELA at Cycle 2 by 2 patients .
Of the reported ARRs , local cutaneous reactions with RITUXAN HYCELA were reported in 32 patients .
These events resolved within a median of 2 days from the onset ( range 1 to 37 days ) .
Majority of these reactions were Grade 1 and 2 and were observed in 31 patients ( 16 % ) .

Eighty two percent of patients receiving RITUXAN HYCELA or rituximab completed all 8 cycles of study treatment .
In both RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab treatment groups , patients experienced 4 . 9 months median duration of rituximab exposure in each arm .
The demographic characteristics were balanced .
Most patients were White ( 79 % ) and 54 % were male .
The median was 64 years and median BSA was 1 . 83 m2 .
The incidences of adverse reactions of any grade ( RITUXAN HYCELA [ 94 % ] vs . rituximab [ 92 % ] ) ( Table 2 ) , Grade 3 – 4 adverse reactions ( RITUXAN HYCELA [ 63 % ] vs . rituximab [ 57 % ] ) , and serious adverse reactions ( RITUXAN HYCELA [ 42 % ] vs . rituximab [ 37 % ] ) were generally comparable between the two treatment groups .
The common adverse reactions ( occurring in ≥ 20 % of patients in any treatment group ) were neutropenia , alopecia , nausea , and anemia .
A total of 91 patients ( 16 % ) died , including 58 / 369 patients ( 16 % ) in RITUXAN HYCELA and 33 / 203 patients ( 16 % ) in rituximab .
Of these patients , 44 patients ( 29 patients RITUXAN HYCELA [ 8 % ] vs . 15 patients rituximab [ 7 % ] ) died due to adverse reactions and 35 patients ( 22 patients RITUXAN HYCELA [ 6 % ] vs . 13 patients rituximab [ 6 % ] ) died due to disease progression .
Pneumonia ( 4 patients RITUXAN HYCELA vs . 1 patient rituximab ) , septic shock ( 2 patients RITUXAN HYCELA vs . 3 patients rituximab ) , and cardiac arrest ( 1 patient RITUXAN HYCELA vs . 3 patients rituximab ) were the most common adverse reactions leading to death .
The incidence of administration - related reactions was balanced between the RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab groups ( 28 % vs . 29 % ) .
Grade 1 – 2 ARRs constituted 97 % of the overall ARRs for the RITUXAN HYCELA arm and 80 % for the rituximab arm .
Of the reported ARRs , local cutaneous reactions with RITUXAN HYCELA were reported in 17 patients .
These events resolved within a median of 2 days from the onset ( range 1 to 32 days ) .

The safety analysis population in part 2 of the study included 85 patients receiving RITUXAN HYCELA ( 1 , 600 mg rituximab / 26 , 800 Units hyaluronidase human ) and 89 patients receiving 500 mg / m2 rituximab .
In both RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab groups , patients had similar median duration of rituximab exposure ( 4 . 9 vs . 4 . 7 months ) .
The majority of patients received all 6 cycles of study treatment ( 86 % RITUXAN HYCELA vs . 81 % rituximab ) .
The patient population was predominantly White ( 96 % ) and male ( 65 % ) , with a median age of 60 years and median BSA of 1 . 9 m2 ( 1 . 97 and 1 . 86 m2 for the RITUXAN HYCELA and intravenous rituximab groups , respectively ) .
Overall , the treatment groups were balanced with respect to demographic characteristics , with the exception of more males in the RITUXAN HYCELA arm ( 71 % RITUXAN HYCELA vs . 60 % rituximab ) .
Baseline disease characteristics were similar between the two groups .
Over half of the patients ( 62 % ) had Binet Stage B disease and the majority had typical CLL characterizations ( 93 % ) , with median time from first CLL diagnosis to randomization being 18 . 5 months .
The incidences of adverse reactions were balanced between the two treatment groups ( 96 % RITUXAN HYCELA vs . 91 % rituximab ) , and the common adverse reactions ( occurring in ≥ 20 % of patients in any arm ) were infections , neutropenia , nausea , thrombocytopenia , pyrexia , anemia , vomiting , and injection site erythema .
The incidences of Grade 3 – 4 adverse reactions were also balanced between the two treatment groups ( 69 % RITUXAN HYCELA vs . 71 % rituximab ) .
The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 29 % for RITUXAN HYCELA and 33 % for rituximab .
The incidence of administration - related reactions was 44 % for RITUXAN HYCELA and 45 % for rituximab ) .
Of the reported ARRs , local cutaneous reactions with RITUXAN HYCELA were reported in 15 patients .

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
In the SABRINA study , where previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma were treated with RITUXAN HYCELA or rituximab in combination with CVP or CHOP , the incidence of treatment - induced / enhanced anti - rituximab antibodies in the RITUXAN HYCELA group was similar to that observed in the rituximab group ( 2 . 0 % RITUXAN HYCELA vs . 1 . 9 % rituximab ) .
The incidence of treatment - induced / enhanced anti - recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies was 15 % in the RITUXAN HYCELA group compared with 8 % in the rituximab group , and the overall proportion of patients found to have anti - recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies remained generally constant over the follow - up period in both cohorts .
All patients who tested positive for anti - recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies at any point during the study were negative for neutralizing antibodies .
In the SAWYER study , where previously untreated patients with CLL were treated with RITUXAN HYCELA or rituximab in combination with FC , the incidence of treatment - induced / enhanced anti - rituximab antibodies was 12 % in the RITUXAN HYCELA group and 15 % in the rituximab group .
The incidence of treatment - induced / enhanced anti - recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies was 11 % in the RITUXAN HYCELA treatment arm .
None of the patients who tested positive for anti - recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies tested positive for neutralizing antibodies .
The clinical relevance of the development of anti - rituximab or anti - recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies after treatment with RITUXAN HYCELA is not known .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of rituximab - containing products .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Hematologic : prolonged pancytopenia , marrow hypoplasia , Grade 3 – 4 prolonged or late - onset neutropenia , hyperviscosity syndrome in Waldenstrom ' s macroglobulinemia , prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia • Cardiac : fatal cardiac failure • Immune / Autoimmune Events : uveitis , optic neuritis , systemic vasculitis , pleuritis , lupus - like syndrome , serum sickness , polyarticular arthritis , and vasculitis with rash .
• Infection : viral infections , including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , increase in fatal infections in HIV - associated lymphoma , and a reported increased incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections • Neoplasia : disease progression of Kaposi ' s sarcoma .
• Skin : severe mucocutaneous reactions , pyoderma gangrenosum ( including genital presentation ) .
• Gastrointestinal : bowel obstruction and perforation .
• Pulmonary : fatal bronchiolitis obliterans and fatal interstitial lung disease .
Renal toxicity when used in combination with cisplatin .
( 5 . 8 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on human data , rituximab - containing products can cause fetal harm due to B - cell lymphocytopenia in infants exposed to rituximab in - utero ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
There are no available data on RITUXAN HYCELA use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
In animal reproduction studies , intravenous administration of a rituximab product to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis caused lymphoid B cell depletion in the newborn offspring at doses resulting in 80 % of the exposure ( based on AUC ) of those achieved following a dose of 2 grams in humans .
Reduced fetal weight and increased fetal lethality were observed following subcutaneous administration of hyaluronidase human in mice at a dose > 2700 times higher than the human dose .
Comparable systemic exposure levels could occur in a pregnant patient following accidental intravenous administration of an entire vial of RITUXAN HYCELA ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The estimated background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 % – 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % – 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions Observe newborns and infants for signs of infection and manage accordingly .
Data Human Data Postmarketing data indicate that B - cell lymphocytopenia generally lasting less than 6 months can occur in infants exposed to rituximab in - utero .
Rituximab was detected postnatally in the serum of infants exposed in - utero .
Animal Data RITUXAN HYCELA for subcutaneous injection contains rituximab and hyaluronidase human [ see Description ( 11 ) ] .
Rituximab Product : • An embryo - fetal developmental toxicity study was performed on pregnant cynomolgus monkeys .
Pregnant animals received rituximab via the intravenous route during early gestation ( organogenesis period ; post coitum days 20 through 50 ) .
Rituximab was administered as loading doses on post coitum ( PC ) Days 20 , 21 and 22 , at 15 , 37 . 5 or 75 mg / kg / day , and then weekly on PC Days 29 , 36 , 43 and 50 , at 20 , 50 or 100 mg / kg / week .
The 100 mg / kg / week dose resulted in 80 % of the exposure ( based on AUC ) of those achieved following a dose of 2 grams in humans .
Rituximab crosses the monkey placenta .
Exposed offspring did not exhibit any teratogenic effects but did have decreased lymphoid tissue B cells .
• A subsequent pre - and postnatal reproductive toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys was completed to assess developmental effects including the recovery of B cells and immune function in infants exposed to rituximab in utero .
Animals were treated with a loading dose of 0 , 15 , or 75 mg / kg every day for 3 days , followed by weekly dosing with 0 , 20 , or 100 mg / kg dose .
Subsets of pregnant females were treated from PC Day 20 through postpartum Day 78 , PC Day 76 through PC Day 134 , and from PC Day 132 through delivery and postpartum Day 28 .
Regardless of the timing of treatment , decreased B cells and immunosuppression were noted in the offspring of rituximab - treated pregnant animals .
The B - cell counts returned to normal levels , and immunologic function was restored within 6 months postpartum .
Hyaluronidase Human : • In an embryo - fetal study , mice have been dosed daily by subcutaneous injection during the period of organogenesis with hyaluronidase human at dose levels up to 2 , 200 , 000 U / kg , which is > 2700 times higher than the human dose .
The study found no evidence of teratogenicity .
Reduced fetal weight and increased numbers of fetal resorptions were observed , with no effects found at a daily dose of 360 , 000 U / kg , which is > 450 times higher than the human dose .
• In a peri - and post - natal reproduction study , mice have been dosed daily by subcutaneous injection , with hyaluronidase human from implantation through lactation and weaning at dose levels up to 1 , 100 , 000 U / kg , which is > 1 , 300 times higher than the human dose .
The study found no adverse effects on sexual maturation , learning and memory or fertility of the offspring .
8 . 2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of hyaluronidase human in human milk or the effect of rituximab on milk production , and there is limited data on the effect of rituximab on the breastfed child .
However , rituximab is detected in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys and maternal IgG is present in human breast milk .
Rituximab has also been reported to be excreted at low concentrations in human breast milk .
Given that the clinical significance of this finding for children is not known , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with RITUXAN HYCELA and for 6 months after the last dose due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Rituximab - containing products can cause fetal harm [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating RITUXAN HYCELA .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with RITUXAN HYCELA and for 12 months after the last dose of rituximab - containing products , including RITUXAN HYCELA .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of RITUXAN HYCELA in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in the SABRINA , MabEase , and SAWYER studies , 37 % were 65 and over , while 10 % were 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
11 DESCRIPTION RITUXAN HYCELA is a combination of rituximab and hyaluronidase human .
Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric murine / human monoclonal IgG1 kappa antibody directed against the CD20 antigen .
Rituximab has an approximate molecular weight of 145 kD .
Rituximab has a binding affinity for the CD20 antigen of approximately 8 . 0 nM .
Rituximab is produced by mammalian cell ( Chinese Hamster Ovary ) suspension .
Recombinant human hyaluronidase is an endoglycosidase used to increase the dispersion and absorption of co - administered drugs when administered subcutaneously .
It is produced by mammalian ( Chinese Hamster Ovary ) cells containing a DNA plasmid encoding for a soluble fragment of human hyaluronidase ( PH20 ) .
It is a glycosylated single - chain protein with an approximate molecular weight of 61 kD .
RITUXAN HYCELA ( rituximab and hyaluronidase human ) injection is a colorless to yellowish , clear to opalescent solution supplied in sterile , preservative - free , single - dose vials for subcutaneous use .
RITUXAN HYCELA is supplied as 1 , 400 mg rituximab and 23 , 400 Units hyaluronidase human per 11 . 7 mL in single - dose vials or 1 , 600 mg rituximab and 26 , 800 Units hyaluronidase human per 13 . 4 mL in single - dose vials .
Each mL of solution contains rituximab ( 120 mg ) , hyaluronidase human ( 2 , 000 Units ) , L - histidine ( 0 . 53 mg ) , L - histidine hydrochloride monohydrate ( 3 . 47 mg ) , L - methionine ( 1 . 49 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 6 mg ) , α , α - trehalose dihydrate ( 79 . 45 mg ) , and Water for Injection .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface of pre - B and mature B - lymphocytes .
Upon binding to CD20 , rituximab mediates B - cell lysis .
Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC ) and antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) .
Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide found in the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous tissue .
It is depolymerized by the naturally occurring enzyme hyaluronidase .
Unlike the stable structural components of the interstitial matrix , hyaluronan has a half - life of approximately 0 . 5 days .
Hyaluronidase human increases permeability of the subcutaneous tissue by temporarily depolymerizing hyaluronan .
In the doses administered , hyaluronidase human in RITUXAN HYCELA acts locally .
The effects of hyaluronidase human are reversible and permeability of the subcutaneous tissue is restored within 24 to 48 hours .
Hyaluronidase human has been shown to increase the absorption rate of a rituximab product into the systemic circulation when given in the subcutis of Göttingen Minipigs .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Peripheral B - cell counts declined to levels below normal following a dose of rituximab by intravenous infusion .
In patients treated with rituximab for hematological malignancies , B cell recovery began within 6 months of treatment and generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy , although in some patients this may take longer .
Follicular Lymphoma ( FL ) Peripheral B - cell counts decline to levels below normal following the first cycle of rituximab and are maintained during treatment with RITUXAN HYCELA .
After stopping RITUXAN HYCELA treatment , B - cell repletion followed similar kinetics to that of rituximab with B - cell repletion beginning after 6 months of stopping treatment , although in some patients this may take longer .
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) Following the first cycle of treatment of rituximab , B - cells begin to deplete , with 28 % of patients B - cell depleted at pre - dose Cycle 2 in the SAWYER study .
An increase in the proportion of B - cell depleted patients was observed with subsequent cycles of RITUXAN HYCELA and by Cycle 6 , 96 % of patients were depleted .
Patients remained B - cell depleted until the month 9 follow - up visit , where signs of repletion were seen .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The geometric mean rituximab exposures are provided in Table 4 .
The pharmacokinetic properties of rituximab following the administration of RITUXAN HYCELA in the approved indications are provided in Table 5 .
The elimination of rituximab was characterized by a time - dependent process that occurred early in therapy and a time - independent process .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of RITUXAN HYCELA or rituximab , or to determine potential effects on fertility in males or females .
RITUXAN HYCELA contains hyaluronidase human .
Hyaluronidases are found in most tissues of the body .
Long - term animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of hyaluronidase human .
In addition , when hyaluronidase human was administered to cynomolgus monkeys for 39 weeks at dose levels up to 220 , 000 U / kg , which is > 90 times higher than the human dose , no evidence of toxicity to the male or female reproductive system was found through periodic monitoring of in - life parameters , e . g . , semen analyses , hormone levels , menstrual cycles , and also from gross pathology , histopathology and organ weight data .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Follicular Lymphoma The SABRINA study [ NCT01200758 ] was a randomized , two - stage , open - label , multicenter study that enrolled a total of 410 patients with previously untreated , CD20 - positive follicular lymphoma of Grade 1 , 2 or 3 a requiring therapy .
The study design is identical in stage 1 and 2 .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive either a rituximab product by intravenous infusion 375 mg / m2 for 8 cycles or 1 cycle of a rituximab product by intravenous infusion 375 mg / m2 followed by 7 cycles of RITUXAN HYCELA 1 , 400 mg / 23 , 400 Units ( 1 , 400 mg rituximab and 23 , 400 Units hyaluronidase human ) both every 3 weeks in combination with a total of 6 – 8 cycles of CHOP or 8 cycles of CVP chemotherapy .
Patients underwent interim staging after 4 cycles .
Patients who received R - CHOP and achieved a CR , CRu , PR or SD at the interim assessment could receive either 4 more cycles of R - CHOP or 2 cycles of R - CHOP followed by 2 cycles of monotherapy with rituximab product or RITUXAN HYCELA depending on randomization arm ( i . e . , a total of 8 cycles of rituximab product or RITUXAN HYCELA ) .
Patients with at least a PR after combination treatment with chemotherapy continued with single agent maintenance treatment administered every 8 weeks for 24 months with rituximab product or RITUXAN HYCELA as per their randomization ( i . e . , total of 12 cycles of maintenance treatment ) .
Randomization was stratified by : underlying chemotherapy backbone ( CHOP vs CVP ) , Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index ( FLIPI ) ( low - risk vs . intermediate - risk vs . high - risk ) , and region ( Europe and North America vs . South and Central America vs Asia ) .
The main outcome measure for Stage 1 was the estimated ratio of observed rituximab serum Ctrough SC / Ctrough IV at Cycle 7 of combination treatment with chemotherapy every 3 weeks .
The main outcome measure for Stage 2 was the investigator - assessed ORR consisting of CR , CRu , and PR at the completion of combination treatment with chemotherapy .
Additional outcome measures were CRR ( CR and CRu ) at the end of completion of combination treatment with chemotherapy , ORR and CRR at the end of completion of maintenance treatment , and time - to - event endpoints ( progression - free survival ( PFS ) , and overall survival ( OS ) ) .
Of all randomized patients , the median age was 57 years ( range : 28 to 86 ) , 53 % were female , and 86 % were White .
The median BSA was 1 . 83 m2 .
45 % had high risk or 34 % had intermediate risk FLIPI score , and 54 % had Ann Arbor Stage IV disease .
Ninety percent of patients completed all 8 cycles of combination treatment with chemotherapy , and 70 % of patients completed 20 cycles of both combination and maintenance treatment .
Median treatment duration was 27 . 1 months in both groups .
The median number of cycles received was 20 in both groups .
The pharmacokinetic results for the primary endpoint in Stage 1 , rituximab Ctrough at Cycle 7 ( i . e . , 21 days after Cycle 7 rituximab administration ) , demonstrated that RITUXAN HYCELA 1 , 400 mg / 23 , 400 Units was non - inferior compared with rituximab at 375 mg / m2 in patients receiving combination treatment with chemotherapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

14 . 4 Patient Experience Previously untreated adult patients outside of the United States with CD20 + diffuse large B - cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) or CD20 + follicular non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma ( FL ) Grades 1 , 2 , or 3 a were randomized to receive a standard chemotherapy regimen ( CHOP , CVP , or bendamustine ) and either RITUXAN HYCELA 1 , 400 mg / 23 , 400 Units at Cycles 2 – 4 ( after the first cycle with intravenous rituximab ) or a rituximab product by intravenous infusion at Cycles 1 – 4 .
After the fourth cycle , patients were crossed over to the alternative route of administration for the remaining 4 cycles .
After Cycle 8 , 477 of 620 patients ( 77 % ) reported preferring subcutaneous administration of RITUXAN HYCELA over intravenous rituximab and the most common reason was that administration required less time in the clinic .
After Cycle 8 , 66 of 620 patients ( 11 % ) preferred rituximab intravenous administration and the most common reason was that it felt more comfortable during administration .
Forty eight of 620 patients ( 7 . 7 % ) had no preference for the route of administration .
Twenty nine subjects of 620 ( 4 . 7 % ) received Cycle 8 but did not complete the preference questionnaire .
