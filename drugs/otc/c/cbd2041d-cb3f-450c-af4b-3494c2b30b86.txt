ADVERSE REACTIONS Citrate reactions or toxicity may occur with the infusion of blood products to patient and return of blood containing citrate anticoagulant to donors .
The recipient of the blood containing citrate should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity .
The signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity begin with paresthesia , a " tingling " sensation around the mouth or in the extremities , followed by severe reactions that are characterized by hypotension and possible cardiac arrhythmia .
Citrate toxicity may occur more frequently in patients who are hypothermic , have impaired liver or renal function , or have low calcium levels because of an underlying disease .
Citrate reactions or toxicity may occur with the infusion and return of blood containing citrate anticoagulant .
The recipient of the blood containing citrate should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity .
