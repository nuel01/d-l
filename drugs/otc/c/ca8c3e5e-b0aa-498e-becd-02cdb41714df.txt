NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 is an insulin analog indicated to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus .
Important Limitations of Use : In premix insulins , such as Novolog Mix 70 / 30 , the proportions of rapid acting and long acting insulins are fixed and do not allow for basal versus prandial dose adjustments ( 1 ) .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Enter section text here • Only for subcutaneous injection ( 2 . 1 ) Type 1 DM : dose within 15 minutes before meal initiation .
Type 2 DM : dose within 15 minutes before or after starting a meal .
• Do not administer intravenously ( 2 . 1 ) .
• Do not use in insulin infusion pumps ( 2 . 1 ) .
• Must be resuspended immediately before use ( 2 . 2 ) .
2 . 1 Dosing NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 is an insulin analog with an earlier onset and intermediate duration of action in comparison to the basal human insulin premix .
The addition of protamine to the rapid - acting aspart insulin analog ( NovoLog ) results in insulin activity that is 30 % short - acting and 70 % long - acting .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 is typically dosed on a twice - daily basis ( with each dose intended to cover 2 meals or a meal and a snack ) .
The dosage of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 must be individualized .
The written prescription for NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 should include the full name , to avoid confusion with NovoLog ( insulin aspart ) and Novolin 70 / 30 ( human premix ) .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 should appear uniformly white and cloudy .
Do not use it if it looks clear or if it contains solid particles .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 should not be used after the printed expiration date .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 should be administered by subcutaneous injection in the abdominal region , buttocks , thigh , or upper arm .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 has a faster onset of action than human insulin premix 70 / 30 and should be dosed within 15 minutes before meal initiation for patients with type 1 diabetes .
For patients with type 2 diabetes , dosing should occur within 15 minutes before or after meal initiation .
Injection sites should be rotated within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy .
As with all insulins , the duration of action may vary according to the dose , injection site , blood flow , temperature , and level of physical activity .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 should not be administered intravenously or used in insulin infusion pumps .
Dose regimens of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 will vary among patients and should be determined by the health care professional familiar with the patient ’ s recommended glucose treatment goals , metabolic needs , eating habits , and other lifestyle variables .
2 . 2 Resuspension NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 is a suspension that must be visually inspected and resuspended immediately before use .
The NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 vial should be rolled gently in your hands in a horizontal position 10 times to mix it .
The rolling procedure must be repeated until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy .
Inject immediately .
Resuspension is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature .
The NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 FlexPen should be rolled 10 times gently between your hands in a horizontal position .
Thereafter , turn the NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 FlexPen upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the reservoir to the other .
Do this at least 10 times .
The rolling and turning procedure must be repeated until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy .
Inject immediately .
Before each subsequent injection , turn the disposable NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 FlexPen upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the reservoir to the other at least 10 times and until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy .
Inject immediately .

• 10 mL vials • 3 mL NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 FlexPen Each presentation contains 100 Units of insulin aspart per mL ( U - 100 ) ( 3 ) • 10 mL vials • 3 mL NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 FlexPen 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 is contraindicated • during episodes of hypoglycemia • in patients with hypersensitivity to NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 or one of its excipients .
• Do not use during episodes of hypoglycemia ( 4 ) .
• Do not use in patients with hypersensitivity to NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 or one of its excipients ( 4 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Enter section text here • NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 should not be mixed with any other insulin product ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy .
Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes .
Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) .
• Insulin , particularly when given in settings of poor glycemic control , can cause hypokalemia .
Use caution in patients predisposed to hypokalemia ( 5 . 3 ) .
• Like all insulins , NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 requirements may be reduced in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment ( 5 . 4 , 5 . 5 ) .
• Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , may occur with insulin products , including NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 ( 5 . 6 ) .
5 . 1 Administration The short and long - acting components of insulin mixes , including NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 , cannot be titrated independently .
Because NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 has peak pharmacodynamic activity between 1 - 4 hours after injection , it should be administered within 15 minutes of meal initiation [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ] .
The dose of insulin required to provide adequate glycemic control for one of the meals may result in hyper - or hypoglycemia for the other meal .
The pharmacodynamic profile may also be inadequate for patients who require more frequent meals .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 should not be mixed with any other insulin product .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 should not be used intravenously .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 should not be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes .
Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision .
Changing from one insulin product to another or changing the insulin strength may result in the need for a change in dosage .
Changes may also be necessary during illness , emotional stress , and other physiologic stress in addition to changes in meals and exercise .
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of all insulins may be altered by the site used for injection and the degree of vascularization of the site .
Smoking , temperature , and exercise contribute to variations in blood flow and insulin absorption .
These and other factors contribute to inter - and intra - patient variability .
Needles and NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 FlexPen must not be shared .
5 . 2 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy , including NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 .
Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and / or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and / or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin , including trials with NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 .
The timing of hypoglycemia may reflect the time - action profile of the insulin formulation [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ] .
Other factors , such as changes in dietary intake ( e . g . , amount of food or timing of meals ) , injection site , exercise , and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
As with all insulins , use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia ( e . g . patients who are fasting or have erratic food intake ) .
The patient ’ s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia .
This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important , such as driving or operating machinery .
Rapid changes in serum glucose levels may induce symptoms of hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes , regardless of the glucose value .
Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions , such as long duration of diabetes , diabetic nerve disease , use of medications such as beta - blockers , or intensified diabetes control [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hypokalemia All insulin products , including NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 , cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space , possibly leading to hypokalemia that , if left untreated , may cause respiratory paralysis , ventricular arrhythmia , and death .
Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia ( e . g . patients using potassium - lowering medications or patients taking medications sensitive to potassium concentrations ) .
5 . 4 Renal Impairment Clinical or pharmacology studies with NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 in diabetic patients with various degrees of renal impairment have not been conducted .
As with other insulins , the requirements for NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 may be reduced in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 5 Hepatic Impairment Clinical or pharmacology studies with NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 in diabetic patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment have not been conducted .
As with other insulins , the requirements for NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 6 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Local Reactions - As with other insulin therapy , patients may experience reactions such as erythema , edema or pruritus at the site of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 injection .
These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks , but in some occasions , may require discontinuation of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 .
In some instances , these reactions may be related to the insulin molecule , other components in the insulin preparation including protamine and cresol , components in skin cleansing agents , or injection techniques .
Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of cresol as an injectable excipient .
Systemic Reactions - Less common , but potentially more serious , is generalized allergy to insulin , which may cause rash ( including pruritus ) over the whole body , shortness of breath , wheezing , reduction in blood pressure , rapid pulse , or sweating .
Severe cases of generalized allergy , including anaphylactic reaction , may be life threatening .
5 . 7 Antibody Production Specific anti - insulin antibodies as well as cross - reacting anti - insulin antibodies were monitored in a 3 - month , open - label comparator trial as well as in a long - term extension trial .
Changes in cross - reactive antibodies were more common after NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 than with Novolin 70 / 30 but these changes did not correlate with change in HbA1c or increase in insulin dose .
The clinical significance of these antibodies has not been established .
Antibodies did not increase further after long - term exposure ( > 6 months ) to NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Experience Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs , therefore , the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial , and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice .
• Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin , including NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] and [ Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
• Insulin initiation and glucose control intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with transitory , reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder , worsening of diabetic retinopathy , and acute painful peripheral neuropathy .
However , long - term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy .
• Lipodystrophy Long - term use of insulin , including NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 , can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections .
Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy ( thickening of adipose tissue ) and lipoatrophy ( thinning of adipose tissue ) , and may affect insulin absorption .
Rotate insulin injection sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy .
• Weight gain Weight gain can occur with some insulin therapies , including NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 , and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria .
• Peripheral Edema Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema , particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy .
• Frequencies of adverse drug reactions The frequencies of adverse drug reactions during a clinical trial with NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below .
The trial was a three - month , open - label trial in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who were treated twice daily ( before breakfast and before supper ) with NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 .

Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency .
They include medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Adverse reactions observed with insulin therapy include hypoglycemia , allergic reactions , local injection site reactions , lipodystrophy , rash and pruritus ( 6 ) .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Enter section text here 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B . All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects , loss , or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure .
This background risk is increased in pregnancies complicated by hyperglycemia and may be decreased with good metabolic control .
It is essential for patients with diabetes or history of gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control before conception and throughout pregnancy .
Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester , generally increase during the second and third trimesters , and rapidly decline after delivery .
Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential in such patients .
An open - label , randomized study compared the safety and efficacy of NovoLog ( the rapid - acting component of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 ) versus human insulin in the treatment of pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes ( 322 exposed pregnancies ( NovoLog : 157 , human insulin : 165 ) ) .
Two - thirds of the enrolled patients were already pregnant when they entered the study .
Since only one - third of the patients enrolled before conception , the study was not large enough to evaluate the risk of congenital malformations .
Mean HbA1c of ~ 6 % was observed in both groups during pregnancy , and there was no significant difference in the incidence of maternal hypoglycemia .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 .
However , subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with NovoLog ( the rapid - acting component of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 ) and regular human insulin in rats and rabbits .
In these studies , NovoLog was given to female rats before mating , during mating , and throughout pregnancy , and to rabbits during organogenesis .
The effects of NovoLog did not differ from those observed with subcutaneous regular human insulin .
NovoLog , like human insulin , caused pre - and post - implantation losses and visceral / skeletal abnormalities in rats at a dose of 200 U / kg / day ( approximately 32 - times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 . 0 U / kg / day , based on U / body surface area ) , and in rabbits at a dose of 10 U / kg / day ( approximately three times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 . 0 U / kg / day , based on U / body surface area ) .
The effects are probably secondary to maternal hypoglycemia at high doses .
No significant effects were observed in rats at a dose of 50 U / kg / day and rabbits at a dose of 3 U / kg / day .
These doses are approximately 8 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 . 0 U / kg / day for rats and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 . 0 U / kg / day for rabbits based on U / body surface area .
Female patients should be advised to discuss with their physician if they intend to , or if they become pregnant .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of the use of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 in pregnant women .
8 . 2 Nursing Mothers It is unknown whether insulin aspart is excreted in human milk as occurs with human insulin .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of the use of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 or NovoLog in lactating women .
Women with diabetes who are lactating may require adjustments of their insulin doses .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in this population .
10 OVERDOSAGE Hypoglycemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin relative to food intake , energy expenditure , or both .
Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose .
Adjustments in drug dosage , meal patterns , or exercise , may be needed .
More severe episodes with coma , seizure , or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular / subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose .
Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery .
11 DESCRIPTION NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 ( 70 % insulin aspart protamine suspension and 30 % insulin aspart injection , [ rDNA origin ] ) is a human insulin analog suspension containing 70 % insulin aspart protamine crystals and 30 % soluble insulin aspart .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 is a blood glucose - lowering agent with an earlier onset and an intermediate duration of action .
Insulin aspart is homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by aspartic acid in position B28 , and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( baker ’ s yeast ) .
Insulin aspart ( NovoLog ) has the empirical formula C256H381N65O79S6 and a molecular weight of 5825 . 8 Da .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 1 .
Structural formula of insulin aspart NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 is a uniform , white , sterile suspension that contains insulin aspart 100 Units / mL .
Inactive ingredients for the 10 mL vial are mannitol 36 . 4 mg / mL , phenol 1 . 50 mg / mL , metacresol 1 . 72 mg / mL , zinc 19 . 6 μg / mL , disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate 1 . 25 mg / mL , sodium chloride 0 . 58 mg / mL , and protamine sulfate 0 . 32 mg / mL .
Inactive ingredients for the NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 FlexPen are glycerol 16 . 0 mg / mL , phenol 1 . 50 mg / mL , metacresol 1 . 72 mg / mL , zinc 19 . 6 μg / mL , disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate 1 . 25 mg / mL , sodium chloride 0 . 877 mg / mL , and protamine sulfate 0 . 32 mg / mL .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 has a pH of 7 . 20 - 7 . 44 .
Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH . [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Enter section text here 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 is the regulation of glucose metabolism .
Insulins , including NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 , bind to the insulin receptors on muscle , liver and fat cells and lower blood glucose by facilitating the cellular uptake of glucose and simultaneously inhibiting the output of glucose from the liver .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The two euglycemic clamp studies described below [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] assessed glucose utilization after dosing of healthy volunteers .
NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 has an earlier onset of action than human premix 70 / 30 in studies of normal volunteers and patients with diabetes .
The onset of action is between 10 - 20 minutes for NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 compared to 30 minutes for Novolin 70 / 30 .
The mean ± SD time to peak activity for NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 is 2 . 4 hr ± 0 . 8 hr compared to 4 . 2 hr ± 0 . 4 hr for Novolin 70 / 30 .
The duration of action may be as long as 24 hours ( see Figure 2 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 2 .
Pharmacodynamic Activity Profile of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 and Novolin 70 / 30 in healthy subjects .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The single substitution of the amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 in insulin aspart ( NovoLog ) reduces the molecule ’ s tendency to form hexamers as observed with regular human insulin .
The rapid absorption characteristics of NovoLog are maintained by NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 .
The insulin aspart in the soluble component of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 is absorbed more rapidly from the subcutaneous layer than regular human insulin .
The remaining 70 % is in crystalline form as insulin aspart protamine which has a prolonged absorption profile after subcutaneous injection .
Bioavailability and Absorption - The relative bioavailability of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 compared to NovoLog and Novolin 70 / 30 indicates that the insulins are absorbed to similar extent .
In euglycemic clamp studies in healthy volunteers ( n = 23 ) after dosing with NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 ( 0 . 2 U / kg ) , a mean maximum serum concentration ( Cmax ) of 23 . 4 ± 5 . 3 mU / L was reached after 60 minutes .
The mean half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 was about 8 to 9 hours .
Serum insulin levels returned to baseline 15 to 18 hours after a subcutaneous dose of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 .
Similar data were seen in a separate euglycemic clamp study in healthy volunteers ( n = 24 ) after dosing with NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 ( 0 . 3 U / kg ) .
A Cmax of 61 . 3 ± 20 . 1 mU / L was reached after 85 minutes .
Serum insulin levels returned to baseline 12 hours after a subcutaneous dose .
The Cmax and the area under the insulin concentration - time curve ( AUC ) after administration of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 was approximately 20 % greater than those after administration of Novolin 70 / 30 , ( see Fig . 3 for pharmacokinetic profiles ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 3 .
Pharmacokinetic Profiles of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 and Novolin 70 / 30 Distribution and Elimination - NovoLog has a low binding to plasma proteins , 0 to 9 % , similar to regular human insulin .
After subcutaneous administration in normal male volunteers ( n = 24 ) , NovoLog was more rapidly eliminated than regular human insulin with an average apparent half - life of 81 minutes compared to 141 minutes for regular human insulin .
The effect of sex , age , obesity , ethnic origin , renal and hepatic impairment , pregnancy , or smoking , on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 has not been studied .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Enter section text here 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Standard 2 - year carcinogenicity studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 .
In 52 - week studies , Sprague - Dawley rats were dosed subcutaneously with NovoLog , the rapid - acting component of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 , at 10 , 50 , and 200 U / kg / day ( approximately 2 , 8 , and 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 . 0 U / kg / day , based on U / body surface area , respectively ) .
At a dose of 200 U / kg / day , NovoLog increased the incidence of mammary gland tumors in females when compared to untreated controls .
The incidence of mammary tumors found with NovoLog was not significantly different from that found with regular human insulin .
The relevance of these findings to humans is not known .
NovoLog was not genotoxic in the following tests : Ames test , mouse lymphoma cell forward gene mutation test , human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test , in vivo micronucleus test in mice , and in ex vivo UDS test in rat liver hepatocytes .
In fertility studies in male and female rats , NovoLog at subcutaneous doses up to 200 U / kg / day ( approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose , based on U / body surface area ) had no direct adverse effects on male and female fertility , or on general reproductive performance of animals .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In standard biological assays in mice and rabbits , one unit of NovoLog has the same glucose - lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin .
However , the effect of NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 is more rapid in onset compared to Novolin ( human insulin ) 70 / 30 due to its faster absorption after subcutaneous injection .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Enter section text here 14 . 1 NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 versus Novolin 70 / 30 In a three - month , open - label trial , patients with Type 1 ( n = 104 ) or Type 2 ( n = 187 ) diabetes were treated twice daily ( before breakfast and before supper ) with NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 or Novolin 70 / 30 .
Patients had received insulin for at least 24 months before the study .
Oral hypoglycemic agents were not allowed within 1 month prior to the study or during the study .
The small changes in HbA1c were comparable across the treatment groups ( see Table 3 ) .

• Look at the vial and the insulin .
The insulin should be white and cloudy after mixing .
The tamper - resistant cap should be on the vial before the first use .
If the cap has already been removed before your first use of the vial , or if the insulin looks clear or contains any particles , do not use it and return it to your pharmacy .

Clean your injection site with an alcohol swab and let the injection site dry before you inject .
Talk with your healthcare provider about how to rotate injection sites and how to give an injection .

Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab .
• Roll the vial gently 10 times in your hands to mix it .
This should be done with the vial in a horizontal ( flat ) position between your palms .
Do not shake the vial .

Insert the needle into the skin right away .
Push the plunger to inject the insulin under your skin .
Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you have injected all the insulin .
When you are finished injecting the insulin , pull the needle out of your skin .

This is normal and has no effect on the dose you just received .
If blood appears after you pull the needle from your skin , press the injection site lightly with an alcohol swab .
Do not rub the area .
Do not recap the needle .
• After the injection , dispose of the needle and syringe in a puncture - resistant container .
Place used syringes , needles , and insulin vials in a disposable puncture - resistant sharps container , or some type of hard plastic or metal container with a screw on cap such as a detergent bottle or coffee can .
• Ask your healthcare provider about the right way to throw away used syringes and needles .
There may be state or local laws about the right way to throw away used syringes and needles .
