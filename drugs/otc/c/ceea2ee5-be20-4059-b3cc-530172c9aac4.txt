4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Rivastigmine tartrate capsules are contraindicated in patients with : • known hypersensitivity to rivastigmine , other carbamate derivatives or other components of the formulation [ see Description ( 11 ) ] • a previous history of application site reaction with rivastigmine transdermal patch suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis , in the absence of negative allergy testing [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] Isolated cases of generalized skin reactions have been described in postmarketing experience [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
• Known hypersensitivity to rivastigmine , other carbamate derivatives or other components of the formulation .
( 4 ) • History of application site reaction with rivastigmine transdermal patch suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis , in the absence of negative allergy testing .
( 4 , 5 . 2 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Gastrointestinal adverse reactions may include significant nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , anorexia / decreased appetite , and weight loss , and may necessitate treatment interruption .
Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes .
( 5 . 1 ) • Discontinue rivastigmine in case of disseminated allergic dermatitis , which may occur after oral or transdermal administration ( 4 , 5 . 2 ) .
In patients with suspected allergic contact dermatitis after transdermal rivastigmine use , switch to oral rivastigmine only after negative allergy testing .
5 . 1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Rivastigmine tartrate can cause gastrointestinal adverse reactions , including significant nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , anorexia / decreased appetite , and weight loss .
Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes .
The incidence and severity of these reactions are dose - related [ see AdverseReactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
For this reason , patients should always be started at a dose of 1 . 5 mg twice a day and titrated to their maintenance dose .
If treatment is interrupted for longer than 3 days , treatment should be reinitiated with the lowest daily dose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] to reduce the possibility of severe vomiting and its potentially serious sequelae ( e . g . , there has been one postmarketing report of severe vomiting with esophageal rupture following inappropriate reinitiation of treatment with a 4 . 5 mg dose after 8 weeks of treatment interruption ) .
Inform caregivers to monitor for gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to inform the physician if they occur .
It is critical to inform caregivers that if therapy has been interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance , the next dose should not be administered without contacting the physician regarding proper retitration .
5 . 2 Allergic Dermatitis There have been isolated postmarketing reports of patients experiencing disseminated allergic dermatitis when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration ( oral or transdermal ) .
Treatment should be discontinued if disseminated allergic dermatitis occurs [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
In patients who develop application site reactions , suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine tartrate patch and who still require rivastigmine , treatment should be switched to oral rivastigmine only after negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision .
It is possible that some patients sensitized to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in any form .
5 . 3 Other Adverse Reactions from Increased Cholinergic Activity Neurologic Effects Extrapyramidal Symptoms : Cholinomimetics , including rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms .
Worsening of parkinsonian symptoms , particularly tremor has been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson ’ s disease who were treated with rivastigmine tartrate capsules .
Seizures : Drugs that increase cholinergic activity are believed to have some potential for causing seizures .
However , seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer ' s disease .
Peptic Ulcers / Gastrointestinal Bleeding Cholinesterase inhibitors , including rivastigmine , may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity .
Monitor patients using rivastigmine tartrate for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding , especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers , e . g . , those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
Clinical studies of rivastigmine have shown no significant increase , relative to placebo , in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding .
Use with Anesthesia Rivastigmine , as a cholinesterase inhibitor , is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine - type muscle relaxation during anesthesia .
Cardiac Conduction Effects Because rivastigmine increases cholinergic activity , use of rivastigmine may have vagotonic effects on heart rate ( e . g . , bradycardia ) .
The potential for this action may be particularly important in patients with sick sinus syndrome or other supraventricular cardiac conduction conditions .
In clinical trials , rivastigmine was not associated with any increased incidence of cardiovascular adverse events , heart rate or blood pressure changes , or electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormalities .
Syncopal episodes have been reported in 3 % of patients receiving 6 mg to 12 mg per day of rivastigmine tartrate , compared to 2 % of placebo patients .
Genitourinary Effects Although not observed in clinical trials of rivastigmine , drugs that increase cholinergic activity may cause urinary obstruction .
Pulmonary Effects Drugs that increase cholinergic activity , including rivastigmine , should be used with care in patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease .
5 . 4 Impairment in Driving or Use of Machinery Dementia may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to use machinery .
The administration of rivastigmine may also result in adverse reactions that are detrimental to these functions .
During treatment with the rivastigmine tartrate , routinely evaluate the patient ’ s ability to continue driving or operating machinery .

A total of 31 % of rivastigmine tartrate - treated patients developed at least 1 episode of vomiting ( compared with 6 % for placebo ) .
The rate of vomiting was higher during the titration phase ( 24 % versus 3 % for placebo ) than in the maintenance phase ( 14 % versus 3 % for placebo ) .
The rates were higher in women than men .
Five percent of patients discontinued for vomiting , compared to less than 1 % for patients on placebo .
Vomiting was severe in 2 % of rivastigmine tartrate - treated patients and was rated as mild or moderate each in 14 % of patients .
The rate of nausea was higher during the titration phase ( 43 % versus 9 % for placebo ) than in the maintenance phase ( 17 % versus 4 % for placebo ) .
** Weight Decreased : In the controlled trials , approximately 26 % of women on high doses of rivastigmine tartrate ( greater than 9 mg per day ) had weight loss equal to or greater than 7 % of their baseline weight compared to 6 % in the placebo - treated patients .
About 18 % of the males in the high - dose group experienced a similar degree of weight loss compared to 4 % in placebo - treated patients .
It is not clear how much of the weight loss was associated with anorexia , nausea , vomiting , and the diarrhea associated with the drug .
*** Anorexia : In the controlled clinical trials , of the patients treated with a rivastigmine tartrate dose of 6 mg to 12 mg per day , 17 % developed anorexia compared to 3 % of the placebo patients .
Neither the time course nor the severity of the anorexia is known .
Mild - to - Moderate Parkinson ’ s Disease Dementia Rivastigmine tartrate has been administered to 779 individuals during clinical trials worldwide .
Of these , 663 patients have been treated for at least 3 months , 476 patients have been treated for at least 6 months , and 313 patients have been treated for 1 year .
Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions , defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5 % and twice the placebo rate , are largely predicted by rivastigmine tartrate ' s cholinergic effects .
These include nausea , vomiting , tremor , anorexia , and dizziness .
Discontinuation Rates The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in the single placebo - controlled trial of rivastigmine tartrate was 18 % for patients receiving 3 mg to 12 mg per day compared to 11 % for patients on placebo during the 24 - week study .
The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation from this study , defined as those occurring in at least 1 % of patients receiving rivastigmine tartrate and more frequent than those receiving placebo , were nausea ( 3 . 6 % rivastigmine tartrate versus 0 . 6 % placebo ) , vomiting ( 1 . 9 % rivastigmine tartrate versus 0 . 6 % placebo ) , and tremor ( 1 . 7 % rivastigmine tartrate versus 0 % placebo ) .
Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of at Least 2 % Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2 % of patients in a single placebo - controlled trial and during the first 24 weeks of a 76 - week open - label active - controlled trial for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with rivastigmine tartrate doses of 3 mg to 12 mg per day than for those treated with placebo in the placebo - controlled trial .
In general , adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of rivastigmine tartrate capsules .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiac Disorders : Tachycardia Hepatobiliary Disorders : Abnormal liver function tests , hepatitis Nervous System Disorders : seizure Psychiatric Disorders : Aggression , nightmares Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Allergic dermatitis , application site hypersensitivity ( patch ) , blister , disseminated allergic dermatitis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , urticaria 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use with metoclopramide , beta - blockers , or cholinomimetic and anticholinergic drugs is not recommended ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Metoclopramide Due to the risk of additive extrapyramidal adverse reactions , the concomitant use of metoclopramide and rivastigmine tartrate is not recommended .
7 . 2 Cholinomimetic and Anticholinergic Medications Rivastigmine tartrate may increase the cholinergic effects of other cholinomimetic medications and may also interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications ( e . g . , oxybutynin , tolterodine ) .
Concomitant use of rivastigmine tartrate with medications having these pharmacologic effects is not recommended unless deemed clinically necessary [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Beta - blockers Additive bradycardic effects resulting in syncope may occur when rivastigmine tartrate is used concomitantly with beta - blockers , especially cardioselective beta - blockers ( including atenolol ) .
Concomitant use of rivastigmine tartrate with beta - blockers is not recommended .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risks associated with the use of rivastigmine tartrate in pregnant women .
In animals , no adverse effects on embryo - fetal development were observed at oral doses 2 to 4 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Oral administration of rivastigmine to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis produced no adverse effects on embryo - fetal development up to the highest dose tested ( 2 . 3 mg / kg / day ) , which is 2 and 4 times , respectively , the MRHD of 12 mg per day on a body surface area ( mg / m2 ) basis .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of rivastigmine in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects of rivastigmine on milk production .
Rivastigmine and its metabolites are excreted in rat milk following oral administration of rivastigmine ; levels of rivastigmine plus metabolites in rat milk are approximately 2 times that in maternal plasma .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for rivastigmine tartrate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from rivastigmine tartrate or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
The use of rivastigmine tartrate in pediatric patients ( below 18 years of age ) is not recommended .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of rivastigmine tartrate , 86 % were 65 years and older while 46 % were 75 years and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment may be able to only tolerate lower doses [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment may be able to only tolerate lower doses [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No data are available on the use of rivastigmine tartrate in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
8 . 8 Low or High Body Weight Because rivastigmine blood levels vary with weight , careful titration and monitoring should be performed in patients with low or high body weights [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving , it is advisable to contact a Poison Control Center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug .
As rivastigmine has a short plasma half - life of about 1 hour and a moderate duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of 8 to 10 hours , it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdoses , no further dose of rivastigmine tartrate should be administered for the next 24 hours .
As in any case of overdose , general supportive measures should be utilized .
Overdosage with cholinesterase inhibitors can result in cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea , vomiting , salivation , sweating , bradycardia , hypotension , respiratory depression , collapse and convulsions .
Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved .
Atypical responses in blood pressure and heart rate have been reported with other drugs that increase cholinergic activity when coadministered with quaternary anticholinergics such as glycopyrrolate .
Additional symptoms associated with rivastigmine overdose are diarrhea , abdominal pain , dizziness , tremor , headache , somnolence , confusional state , hyperhidrosis , hypertension , hallucinations and malaise .
Due to the short half - life of rivastigmine , dialysis ( hemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis , or hemofiltration ) would not be clinically indicated in the event of an overdose .
In overdoses accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting , the use of antiemetics should be considered .
A fatal outcome has been rarely reported with rivastigmine .
11 DESCRIPTION Rivastigmine tartrate is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor and is known chemically as ( S ) - N - Ethyl - N - methyl - 3 - [ 1 - ( dimethylamino ) ethyl ] - phenyl carbamate hydrogen - ( 2 R , 3 R ) - tartrate .
Rivastigmine tartrate is commonly referred to in the pharmacological literature as SDZ ENA 713 or ENA 713 .
It has a molecular formula of C14H22N2O2 • C4H6O6 ( hydrogen tartrate salt – hta salt ) and a molecular weight of 400 . 43 g / mol ( hta salt ) .
Rivastigmine tartrate USP is a white to off - white powder that is very soluble in water , soluble in ethanol and acetonitrile , slightly soluble in n - octanol and very slightly soluble in ethyl acetate .
The distribution coefficient at 37 ° C in n - octanol / phosphate buffer solution pH 7 is 3 . 0 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Rivastigmine tartrate capsules , USP contain rivastigmine tartrate USP , equivalent to 1 . 5 mg , 3 mg , 4 . 5 mg , and 6 mg of rivastigmine base for oral administration .
Inactive ingredients are colloidal silicon dioxide , hypromellose , magnesium stearate , and microcrystalline cellulose .
Each hard - gelatin capsule contains gelatin , iron oxide red , iron oxide yellow , sodium lauryl sulfate , and titanium dioxide .
The capsules are printed with edible ink containing black iron oxide , potassium hydroxide , propylene glycol , shellac and strong ammonia solution .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Although the precise mechanism of action of rivastigmine is unknown , it is thought to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function .
This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase .
Therefore , the effect of rivastigmine may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact .
There is no evidence that rivastigmine alters the course of the underlying dementing process .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics After a 6 mg dose of rivastigmine , anticholinesterase activity is present in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) for about 10 hours , with a maximum inhibition of about 60 % 5 hours after dosing .
In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that the inhibition of cholinesterase by rivastigmine is not affected by the concomitant administration of memantine , an N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor antagonist .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Rivastigmine shows linear pharmacokinetics up to 3 mg twice a day but is nonlinear at higher doses .
Doubling the dose from 3 mg to 6 mg twice a day results in a 3 - fold increase in area under the curve ( AUC ) .
The elimination half - life is about 1 . 5 hours , with most elimination as metabolites via the urine .
Absorption Rivastigmine is rapidly and completely absorbed .
Peak plasma concentrations are reached in approximately 1 hour .
Absolute bioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36 % .
Administration of rivastigmine tartrate with food delays absorption ( Tmax ) by 90 minutes lowers Cmax by approximately 30 % and increases AUC by approximately 30 % .
Distribution Rivastigmine is weakly bound to plasma proteins ( approximately 40 % ) over the therapeutic range .
It readily crosses the blood - brain barrier , reaching CSF peak concentrations in 1 . 4 to 2 . 6 hours .
It has an apparent volume of distribution ( VD ) in the range of 1 . 8 to 2 . 7 L / kg .
Metabolism Rivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolized , primarily via cholinesterase - mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite .
Based on evidence from in vitro and animal studies , the major cytochrome P450 isozymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism .
Consistent with these observations is the finding that no drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 have been observed in humans .
Elimination The major pathway of elimination is via the kidneys .
Following administration of 14 C - rivastigmine to 6 healthy volunteers , total recovery of radioactivity over 120 hours was 97 % in urine and 0 . 4 % in feces .
No parent drug was detected in urine .
The sulfate conjugate of the decarbamylated metabolite is the major component excreted in urine and represents 40 % of the dose .
Mean oral clearance of rivastigmine is 1 . 8 ± 0 . 6 L / min after 6 mg twice a day .
Age Following a single 2 . 5 mg oral dose to elderly volunteers ( 60 years and older , n = 24 ) and younger volunteers ( n = 24 ) , mean oral clearance of rivastigmine was 30 % lower in elderly ( 7 L / min ) than in younger subjects ( 10 L / min ) .
Gender and Race Population pharmacokinetic analysis of oral rivastigmine indicated that neither gender ( n = 277 males and 348 females ) nor race ( n = 575 Caucasian , 34 Black , 4 Asian , and 12 Other ) affected clearance of the drug .
Body Weight A relationship between drug exposure at steady - state ( rivastigmine and metabolite NAP226 - 90 ) and body weight was observed in Alzheimer ’ s dementia patients .
Rivastigmine exposure is higher in subjects with low body weight .
Compared to a patient with a body weight of 65 kg , the rivastigmine steady - state concentrations in a patient with a body weight of 35 kg would be approximately doubled , while for a patient with a body weight of 100 kg the concentrations would be approximately halved .
Renal Impairment Following a single 3 mg dose , mean oral clearance of rivastigmine is 64 % lower in moderately impaired renal patients ( n = 8 , GFR = 10 to 50 mL / min ) than in healthy subjects ( n = 10 , GFR greater than or equal to 60 mL / min ) ; CL / F = 1 . 7 L / min and 4 . 8 L / min , respectively .
In patients with severe renal impairment ( n = 8 , GFR less than 10 mL / min ) , mean oral clearance of rivastigmine is 43 % higher than in healthy subjects ( n = 10 , GFR greater than or equal to 60 mL / min ) ; CL / F = 6 . 9 L / min and 4 . 8 L / min , respectively .
For unexplained reasons , the severely impaired renal patients had a higher clearance of rivastigmine than moderately impaired patients .
Hepatic Impairment Following a single 3 mg dose , mean oral clearance of rivastigmine was 60 % lower in hepatically impaired patients ( n = 10 , biopsy proven ) than in healthy subjects ( n = 10 ) .
After multiple 6 mg twice a day oral dosing , the mean clearance of rivastigmine was 65 % lower in mild ( n = 7 , Child - Pugh score 5 to 6 ) , and moderate ( n = 3 , Child - Pugh score 7 to 9 ) hepatically impaired patients ( biopsy proven , liver cirrhosis ) than in healthy subjects ( n = 10 ) .
Smoking Following oral rivastigmine administration ( up to 12 mg per day ) with nicotine use , population pharmacokinetic analysis showed increased oral clearance of rivastigmine by 23 % ( n = 75 smokers and 549 nonsmokers ) .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Rivastigmine on the Metabolism of Other Drugs Rivastigmine is primarily metabolized through hydrolysis by esterases .
Minimal metabolism occurs via the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes .
Based on in vitro studies , no pharmacokinetic drug interactions with drugs metabolized by the following isoenzyme systems are expected : CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , CYP3A4 / 5 , CYP2E1 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C19 , or CYP2B6 .
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine taken orally and digoxin , warfarin , diazepam or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers .
The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of rivastigmine .
Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Rivastigmine Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP450 metabolism are not expected to alter the metabolism of rivastigmine .
Population pharmacokinetic analysis with a database of 625 patients showed that the pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine taken orally were not influenced by commonly prescribed medications such as antacids ( n = 77 ) , antihypertensives ( n = 72 ) , beta - blockers ( n = 42 ) , calcium channel blockers ( n = 75 ) , antidiabetics ( n = 21 ) , NSAIDs ( n = 79 ) , estrogens ( n = 70 ) , salicylate analgesics ( n = 177 ) , antianginals ( n = 35 ) and antihistamines ( n = 15 ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In oral carcinogenicity studies conducted at doses up to 1 . 1 mg / kg / day in rats and 1 . 6 mg / kg / day in mice , rivastigmine was not carcinogenic .
These doses are less than the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 12 mg per day on an mg / m2 basis .
Mutagenesis Rivastigmine was clastogenic in in vitro chromosomal aberration assays in mammalian cells in the presence , but not the absence , of metabolic activation .
Rivastigmine was negative in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay , an in vitro HGPRT assay , and in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
Impairment of Fertility Rivastigmine had no effect on fertility or reproductive performance in rats at oral doses up to 1 . 1 mg / kg / day , a dose less than the MRHD on an mg / m2 basis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Mild - to - Moderate Alzheimer ’ s Disease The effectiveness of rivastigmine tartrate as a treatment for Alzheimer ' s disease is demonstrated by the results of 2 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical investigations ( Study 1 and Study 2 ) in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease [ diagnosed by NINCDS - ADRDA and DSM - IV criteria , Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 26 , and the Global Deterioration Scale ( GDS ) ] .
The mean age of patients participating in rivastigmine tartrate trials was 73 years with a range of 41 to 95 .
Approximately 59 % of patients were women and 41 % were men .
The racial distribution was Caucasian 87 % , Black 4 % , and other races 9 % .
In each study , the effectiveness of rivastigmine tartrate was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy .
The ability of rivastigmine tartrate to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer ' s Disease Assessment Scale ( ADAS - cog ) , a multi - item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer ' s disease patients .
The ADAS - cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance including elements of memory , orientation , attention , reasoning , language , and praxis .
The ADAS - cog scoring range is from 0 to 70 , with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment .
Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1 , but it is not unusual for non - demented adults to score slightly higher .
The patients recruited as participants in each study had mean scores on ADAS - cog of approximately 23 units , with a range from 1 to 61 .
Experience gained in longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild - to - moderate Alzheimer ' s disease suggests that they gain 6 to 12 units a year on the ADAS - cog .
Lesser degrees of change , however , are seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease because the ADAS - cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease .
The annualized rate of decline in the placebo patients participating in rivastigmine tartrate trials was approximately 3 to 8 units per year .
The ability of rivastigmine tartrate to produce an overall clinical effect was assessed using a Clinician ' s Interview - Based Impression of Change ( CIBIC ) that required the use of caregiver information , the CIBIC - Plus .
The CIBIC - Plus is not a single instrument and is not a standardized instrument like the ADAS - cog .
Clinical trials for investigational drugs have used a variety of CIBIC formats , each different in terms of depth and structure .
As such , results from a CIBIC - Plus reflect clinical experience from the trial or trials in which it was used and cannot be compared directly with the results of CIBIC - Plus evaluations from other clinical trials .
The CIBIC - Plus used in the rivastigmine tartrate trials was a structured instrument based on a comprehensive evaluation at baseline and subsequent time - points of 3 domains : patient cognition , behavior and functioning , including assessment of activities of daily living .
It represents the assessment of a skilled clinician using validated scales based on his / her observation at interviews conducted separately with the patient and the caregiver familiar with the behavior of the patient over the interval rated .
The CIBIC - Plus is scored as a 7 - point categorical rating , ranging from a score of 1 , indicating " markedly improved , " to a score of 4 , indicating " no change " to a score of 7 , indicating " marked worsening . "
The CIBIC - Plus has not been systematically compared directly to assessments not using information from caregivers or other global methods .
U . S . 26 - Week Study of Rivastigmine Tartrate in Mild - to - Moderate Alzheimer ’ s Disease ( Study 1 ) In a study of 26 weeks duration , 699 patients were randomized to either a dose range of 1 mg to 4 mg or 6 mg to 12 mg of rivastigmine tartrate per day or to placebo , each given in divided doses .
The 26 - week study was divided into a 12 - week forced - dose titration phase and a 14 - week maintenance phase .
The patients in the active treatment arms of the study were maintained at their highest tolerated dose within the respective range .
Figure 1 illustrates the time course for the change from baseline in ADAS - cog scores for all 3 dose groups over the 26 weeks of the study .
At 26 weeks of treatment , the mean differences in the ADAS - cog change scores for the rivastigmine tartrate - treated patients compared to the patients on placebo were 1 . 9 and 4 . 9 units for the 1 mg to 4 mg and 6 mg to 12 mg treatments , respectively .
Both treatments were statistically significantly superior to placebo and the 6 mg to 12 mg per day range was significantly superior to the 1 mg to 4 mg per day range .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 2 illustrates the cumulative percentages of patients from each of the 3 treatment groups who had attained at least the measure of improvement in ADAS - cog score shown on the x - axis .
Three change scores , ( 7 - point and 4 - point reductions from baseline or no change in score ) have been identified for illustrative purposes , and the percent of patients in each group achieving that result is shown in the inset table .
The curves demonstrate that both patients assigned to rivastigmine tartrate and placebo have a wide range of responses , but that the rivastigmine tartrate groups are more likely to show the greater improvements .
A curve for an effective treatment would be shifted to the left of the curve for placebo , while an ineffective or deleterious treatment would be superimposed upon , or shifted to the right of the curve for placebo , respectively .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 3 is a histogram of the frequency distribution of CIBIC - Plus scores attained by patients assigned to each of the 3 treatment groups who completed 26 weeks of treatment .
The mean rivastigmine tartrate - placebo differences for these groups of patients in the mean rating of change from baseline were 0 . 32 units and 0 . 35 units for 1 mg to 4 mg and 6 mg to 12 mg of rivastigmine tartrate , respectively .
The mean ratings for the 6 mg to 12 mg per day and 1 mg to 4 mg per day groups were statistically significantly superior to placebo .
The differences between the 6 mg to 12 mg per day and the 1 mg to 4 mg per day groups were statistically significant .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Global 26 - Week Study in Mild - to - Moderate Alzheimer ' s Disease ( Study 2 ) In a second study of 26 weeks duration , 725 patients were randomized to either a dose range of 1 mg to 4 mg or 6 mg to 12 mg of rivastigmine tartrate per day or to placebo , each given in divided doses .
The 26 - week study was divided into a 12 - week forced - dose titration phase and a 14 - week maintenance phase .
The patients in the active treatment arms of the study were maintained at their highest tolerated dose within the respective range .
Figure 4 illustrates the time course for the change from baseline in ADAS - cog scores for all 3 dose groups over the 26 weeks of the study .
At 26 weeks of treatment , the mean differences in the ADAS - cog change scores for the rivastigmine tartrate - treated patients compared to the patients on placebo were 0 . 2 and 2 . 6 units for the 1 mg to 4 mg and 6 mg to 12 mg treatments , respectively .
The 6 mg to 12 mg per day group was statistically significantly superior to placebo , as well as to the 1 mg to 4 mg per day group .
The difference between the 1 mg to 4 mg per day group and placebo was not statistically significant .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 5 illustrates the cumulative percentages of patients from each of the 3 treatment groups who had attained at least the measure of improvement in ADAS - cog score shown on the x - axis .
Similar to the U . S . 26 - week study , the curves demonstrate that both patients assigned to rivastigmine tartrate and placebo have a wide range of responses , but that the 6 mg to 12 mg per day rivastigmine tartrate group is more likely to show the greater improvements .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 6 is a histogram of the frequency distribution of CIBIC - Plus scores attained by patients assigned to each of the 3 treatment groups who completed 26 weeks of treatment .
The mean rivastigmine tartrate - placebo differences for these groups of patients for the mean rating of change from baseline were 0 . 14 units and 0 . 41 units for 1 mg to 4 mg and 6 mg to 12 mg of rivastigmine tartrate , respectively .
The mean ratings for the 6 mg to 12 mg per day group were statistically significantly superior to placebo .
The comparison of the mean ratings for the 1 mg to 4 mg per day group and placebo group was not statistically significant .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] U . S . Fixed - Dose Study in Mild - to - Moderate Alzheimer ' s Disease ( Study 3 ) In a study of 26 weeks duration , 702 patients were randomized to doses of 3 mg , 6 mg , or 9 mg per day of rivastigmine tartrate or to placebo , each given in divided doses .
The fixed - dose study design , which included a 12 - week forced - dose titration phase and a 14 - week maintenance phase , led to a high dropout rate in the 9 mg per day group because of poor tolerability .
At 26 weeks of treatment , significant differences were observed for the ADAS - cog mean change from baseline for the 9 mg per day and 6 mg per day groups , compared to placebo .
No significant differences were observed between any of the rivastigmine tartrate - dose groups and placebo for the analysis of the CIBIC - Plus mean rating of change .
Although no significant differences were observed between rivastigmine tartrate treatment groups , there was a trend toward numerical superiority with higher doses .
Mild - to - Moderate Parkinson ’ s Disease Dementia International 24 - Week Study ( Study 4 ) The effectiveness of rivastigmine tartrate as a treatment for dementia associated with Parkinson ’ s disease is demonstrated by the results of 1 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical investigation in patients with mild - to - moderate dementia , with onset at least 2 years after the initial diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson ’ s disease .
The diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson ’ s disease was based on the United Kingdom Parkinson ’ s Disease Society Brain Bank clinical criteria .
The diagnosis of dementia was based on the criteria stipulated under the DSM - IV category “ Dementia Due To Other General Medical Condition ” ( code 294 . 1 x ) , but patients were not required to have a distinctive pattern of cognitive deficits as part of the dementia .
Alternate causes of dementia were excluded by clinical history , physical and neurological examination , brain imaging , and relevant blood tests .
Patients enrolled in the study had a MMSE score greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 24 at entry .
The mean age of patients participating in this trial was 72 . 7 years with a range of 50 to 91 years .
Approximately , 35 . 1 % of patients were women and 64 . 9 % of patients were men .
The racial distribution was 99 . 6 % Caucasian and other races 0 . 4 % .
This study used a dual outcome assessment strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of rivastigmine tartrate .
The ability of rivastigmine tartrate to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the ADAS - cog .
The ability of rivastigmine tartrate to produce an overall clinical effect was assessed using the Alzheimer ’ s Disease Cooperative Study – Clinician ’ s Global Impression of Change ( ADCS - CGIC ) .
The ADCS - CGIC is a more standardized form of CIBIC - Plus and is also scored as a 7 - point categorical rating , ranging from a score of 1 , indicating " markedly improved , " to a score of 4 , indicating " no change " to a score of 7 , indicating " marked worsening " .
In this study , 541 patients were randomized to a dose range of 3 mg to 12 mg of rivastigmine tartrate per day or to placebo in a ratio of 2 : 1 , given in divided doses .
The 24 - week study was divided into a 16 - week titration phase and an 8 - week maintenance phase .
The patients in the active treatment arm of the study were maintained at their highest tolerated dose within the specified dose range .
Figure 7 illustrates the time course for the change from baseline in ADAS - cog scores for both treatment groups over the 24 - week study .
At 24 weeks of treatment , the mean difference in the ADAS - cog change scores for the rivastigmine tartrate - treated patients compared to the patients on placebo was 3 . 8 points .
This treatment difference was statistically significant in favor of rivastigmine tartrate when compared to placebo .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 8 is a histogram of the distribution of patients ’ scores on the ADCS - CGIC ( Alzheimer ’ s Disease Cooperative Study - Clinician ’ s Global Impression of Change ) at 24 weeks .
The mean difference in change scores between the rivastigmine tartrate and placebo groups from baseline was 0 . 5 points .
This difference was statistically significant in favor of rivastigmine tartrate treatment .
