DESCRIPTION ELIDEL ® ( pimecrolimus ) Cream 1 % contains the compound pimecrolimus , the immunosuppressant 33 - epi - chloro - derivative of the macrolactam ascomycin .
Chemically , pimecrolimus is ( 1 R , 9 S , 12 S , 13 R , 14 S , 17 R , 18 E , 21 S , 23 S , 24 R , 25 S , 27 R ) - 12 - [ ( 1 E ) - 2 - { ( 1 R , 3 R , 4 S ) - 4 - chloro - 3 - methoxycyclohexyl } - 1 - methylvinyl ] - 17 - ethyl - 1 , 14 - dihydroxy - 23 , 25 - dimethoxy - 13 , 19 , 21 , 27 - tetramethyl - 11 , 28 - dioxa - 4 - aza - tricyclo [ 22 . 3 . 1 . 0 4 , 9 ] octacos - 18 - ene - 2 , 3 , 10 , 16 - tetraone .
The compound has the empirical formula C 43H68CINO11 and the molecular weight of 810 . 47 .
The structural formula is [ MULTIMEDIA ] Pimecrolimus is a white to off - white fine crystalline powder .
It is soluble in methanol and ethanol and insoluble in water .
Each gram of ELIDEL Cream 1 % contains 10 mg of pimecrolimus in a whitish cream base of benzyl alcohol , cetyl alcohol , citric acid , mono - and di - glycerides , oleyl alcohol , propylene glycol , sodium cetostearyl sulphate , sodium hydroxide , stearyl alcohol , triglycerides , and water .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action / Pharmacodynamics The mechanism of action of pimecrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not known .
While the following have been observed , the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not known .
It has been demonstrated that pimecrolimus binds with high affinity to macrophilin - 12 ( FKBP - 12 ) and inhibits the calcium - dependent phosphatase , calcineurin .
As a consequence , it inhibits T cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines .
In particular , pimecrolimus inhibits at nanomolar concentrations Interleukin - 2 and interferon gamma ( Th1 - type ) and Interleukin - 4 and Interleukin - 10 ( Th2 - type ) cytokine synthesis in human T cells .
In addition , pimecrolimus prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells in vitro after stimulation by antigen / IgE .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult patients ( n = 52 ) being treated for atopic dermatitis [ 13 % - 62 % Body Surface Area ( BSA ) involvement ] for periods up to a year , a maximum pimecrolimus concentration of 1 . 4 ng / mL was observed among those subjects with detectable blood levels .
In the majority of samples in adult ( 91 % ; 1 , 244 / 1 , 362 ) subjects , blood concentrations of pimecrolimus were below 0 . 5 ng / mL .
Data on blood levels of pimecrolimus measured in pediatric patients are described below in Special Populations , Pediatrics .
Distribution Laboratory in vitro plasma protein binding studies using equilibrium gel filtration have shown that 99 . 5 % of pimecrolimus in plasma is bound to proteins over the pimecrolimus concentration range of 2 - 100 ng / mL tested .
The major fraction of pimecrolimus in plasma appears to be bound to various lipoproteins .
As with other topical calcineurin inhibitors , it is not known whether pimecrolimus is absorbed into cutaneous lymphatic vessels or in regional lymph nodes .
Metabolism Following the administration of a single oral radiolabeled dose of pimecrolimus numerous circulating O - demethylation metabolites were seen .
Studies with human liver microsomes indicate that pimecrolimus is metabolized in vitro by the CYP3A sub - family of metabolizing enzymes .
No evidence of skin mediated drug metabolism was identified in vivo using the minipig or in vitro using stripped human skin .
Elimination Based on the results of the aforementioned radiolabeled study , following a single oral dose of pimecrolimus ~ 81 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered , primarily in the feces ( 78 . 4 % ) as metabolites .
Less than 1 % of the radioactivity found in the feces was due to unchanged pimecrolimus .
Special Populations Pediatrics The systemic exposure to pimecrolimus from ELIDEL ® ( pimecrolimus ) Cream 1 % was investigated in 28 pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis ( 20 % - 80 % BSA involvement ) between the ages of 8 months - 14 yrs .
Following twice daily application for three weeks , blood concentrations of pimecrolimus were < 2 ng / mL with 60 % ( 96 / 161 ) of the blood samples having blood concentration below the limit of quantification ( 0 . 5 ng / mL ) .
However , the children ( 23 children out of the total 28 children investigated ) had at least one detectable blood level as compared to the adults ( 12 adults out of the total 52 adults investigated ) over a 3 - week treatment period .
Due to the erratic nature of the blood levels observed , no correlation could be made between amount of cream , degree of BSA involvement , and blood concentrations .
In general , the blood concentrations measured in adult atopic dermatitis patients were comparable to those seen in the pediatric population .
In a second group of 30 pediatric patients aged 3 - 23 months with 10 % - 92 % BSA involvement , following twice daily application for three weeks , blood concentrations of pimecrolimus were < 2 . 6 ng / mL with 65 % ( 75 / 116 ) of the blood samples having blood concentration below 0 . 5 ng / mL , and 27 % ( 31 / 116 ) below the limit of quantification ( 0 . 1 ng / mL ) for these studies .
Overall , a higher proportion of detectable blood levels was seen in the pediatric patient population as compared to adult population .
This increase in the absolute number of positive blood levels may be due to the larger surface area to body mass ratio seen in these younger subjects .
In addition , a higher incidence of upper respiratory symptoms / infections was also seen relative to the older age group in the PK studies .
At this time , a causal relationship between these findings and ELIDEL use cannot be ruled out .
ELIDEL Cream is not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of age ( see INDICATIONS AND USAGE , WARNINGS , boxed WARNING , and PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use ) .
Renal Insufficiency The effect of renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of topically administered pimecrolimus has not been evaluated but dose - adjustment is not expected to be needed as 80 % of the drug is excreted in the feces .
Hepatic Insufficiency The effect of hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of topically administered pimecrolimus has not been evaluated but dose - adjustment is not expected to be needed .
CLINICAL STUDIES Three randomized , double - blind , vehicle - controlled , multi - center , Phase 3 studies were conducted in 589 pediatric patients ages 3 months - 17 years old to evaluate ELIDEL ® ( pimecrolimus ) Cream 1 % for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis .
Two of the three trials support the use of ELIDEL Cream in patients 2 years and older with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis ( see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use ) .
Three other trials in 1 , 619 pediatric and adult patients provided additional data regarding the safety of ELIDEL Cream in the treatment of atopic dermatitis .
Two of these other trials were vehicle - controlled with optional sequential use of a medium potency topical corticosteroid in pediatric patients and one trial was an active comparator trial in adult patients with atopic dermatitis ( see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Two identical 6 - week , randomized , vehicle - controlled , multi - center , Phase 3 trials were conducted to evaluate ELIDEL Cream for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis .
A total of 403 pediatric patients 2 - 17 years old were included in the studies .
The male / female ratio was approximately 50 % and 29 % of the patients were African American .
At study entry , 59 % of patients had moderate disease and the mean body surface area ( BSA ) affected was 26 % .
About 75 % of patients had atopic dermatitis affecting the face and / or neck region .
In these studies , patients applied either ELIDEL Cream or vehicle cream twice daily to 5 % to 96 % of their BSA for up to 6 weeks .
At endpoint , based on the physician ’ s global evaluation of clinical response , 35 % of patients treated with ELIDEL Cream were clear or almost clear of signs of atopic dermatitis compared to only 18 % of vehicle - treated patients .
More ELIDEL patients ( 57 % ) had mild or no pruritus at 6 weeks compared to vehicle patients ( 34 % ) .
The improvement in pruritus occurred in conjunction with the improvement of the patients ’ atopic dermatitis .
In these two 6 - week studies of ELIDEL , the combined efficacy results at endpoint are as follows : % Patients Elidel ® ( N = 267 ) Vehicle ( N = 136 ) Global Assessment Clear 28 ( 10 % ) 5 ( 4 % ) Clear or Almost Clear 93 ( 35 % ) 25 ( 18 % ) Clear to Mild Disease 180 ( 67 % ) 55 ( 40 % ) In the two pediatric studies that independently support the use of ELIDEL Cream in mild to moderate atopic dermatitis , a significant treatment effect was seen by day 15 .
Of the key signs of atopic dermatitis , erythema , infiltration / papulation , lichenification , and excoriations , erythema and infiltration / papulation were reduced at day 8 when compared to vehicle .
The following graph depicts the time course of improvement in the percent body surface area affected as a result of treatment with ELIDEL Cream in 2 - 17 year olds .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] The following graph shows the time course of improvement in erythema as a result of treatment with ELIDEL Cream in 2 - 17 year olds .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] INDICATIONS AND USAGE ELIDEL ® ( pimecrolimus ) Cream 1 % is indicated as second - linetherapy for the short - term and non - continuous chronic treatment ofmild to moderate atopic dermatitis in non - immunocompromised adults and children 2 years of age and older , who have failed to respond adequately to other topical prescription treatments , or when those treatments are not advisable .
ELIDEL Cream is not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of age ( see WARNINGS , boxed WARNING , and PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use ) .
CONTRAINDICATIONS ELIDEL ® ( pimecrolimus ) Cream 1 % is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to pimecrolimus or any of the components of the cream .
WARNINGS WARNING Long - term Safety of Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors Has Not Been Established Although a causal relationship has not been established , rare cases of malignancy ( e . g . , skin and lymphoma ) have been reported in patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors , including ELIDEL Cream .
Therefore : • Continuous long - term use of topical calcineurin inhibitors , including ELIDEL Cream , in any age group should be avoided , and application limited to areas of involvement with atopic dermatitis .
• ELIDEL Cream is not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of age .
Prolonged systemic use of calcineurin inhibitors for sustained immunosuppression in animal studies and transplant patients following systemic administration has been associated with an increased risk of infections , lymphomas , and skin malignancies .
These risks are associated with the intensity and duration of immunosuppression .
Based on this information and the mechanism of action , there is a concern about a potential risk with the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors , including ELIDEL Cream .
While a causal relationship has not been established , rare cases of skin malignancy and lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors , including ELIDEL Cream .
Therefore : • ELIDEL Cream should not be used in immunocompromised adults and children .
• If signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis do not improve within 6 weeks , patients should be re - examined by their healthcare provider and their diagnosis be confirmed ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
• The safety of ELIDEL Cream has not been established beyond one year of non - continuous use .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , WARNINGS , boxed WARNING , PRECAUTIONS , INDICATIONS AND USAGE , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
PRECAUTIONS General The use of ELIDEL Cream should be avoided on malignant or pre - malignant skin conditions .
Malignant or pre - malignant skin conditions , such as cutaneous T - cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) , can present as dermatitis .
ELIDEL Cream should not be used in patients with Netherton ’ s Syndrome or other skin diseases where there is the potential for increased systemic absorption of pimecrolimus .
The safety of ELIDEL Cream has not been established in patients with generalized erythroderma .
The use of ELIDEL Cream may cause local symptoms such as skin burning ( burning sensation , stinging , soreness ) or pruritus .
Localized symptoms are most common during the first few days of ELIDEL Cream application and typically improve as the lesions of atopic dermatitis resolve ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Bacterial and Viral Skin Infections : Before commencing treatment with ELIDEL Cream , bacterial or viral infections at treatment sites should be resolved .
Studies have not evaluated the safety and efficacy of ELIDEL Cream in the treatment of clinically infected atopic dermatitis .
While patients with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to superficial skin infections including eczema herpeticum ( Kaposi ’ s varicelliform eruption ) , treatment with ELIDEL Cream may be independently associated with an increased risk of varicella zoster virus infection ( chicken pox or shingles ) , herpes simplex virus infection , or eczema herpeticum .
In clinical studies , 15 / 1 , 544 ( 1 % ) cases of skin papilloma ( warts ) were observed in patients using ELIDEL Cream .
The youngest patient was age 2 and the oldest was age 12 .
In cases where there is worsening of skin papillomas or they do not respond to conventional therapy , discontinuation of ELIDEL Cream should be considered until complete resolution of the warts is achieved .
Patients with Lymphadenopathy : In clinical studies , 14 / 1 , 544 ( 0 . 9 % ) cases of lymphadenopathy were reported while using ELIDEL Cream .
These cases of lymphadenopathy were usually related to infections and noted to resolve upon appropriate antibiotic therapy .
Of these 14 cases , the majority had either a clear etiology or were known to resolve .
Patients who receive ELIDEL Cream and who develop lymphadenopathy should have the etiology of their lymphadenopathy investigated .
In the absence of a clear etiology for the lymphadenopathy , or in the presence of acute infectious mononucleosis , ELIDEL Cream should be discontinued .
Patients who develop lymphadenopathy should be monitored to ensure that the lymphadenopathy resolves .
Sun Exposure : During the course of treatment , it is prudent for patients to minimize or avoid natural or artificial sunlight exposure , even while ELIDEL is not on the skin .
The potential effects of ELIDEL Cream on skin response to ultraviolet damage are not known .
Immunocompromised Patients : The safety and efficacy of ELIDEL Cream in immunocompromised patients have not been studied .
Information for Patients ( See Medication Guide . )
Patients using ELIDEL Cream should receive the following information and instructions : What is the most important information a patient should know about ELIDEL Cream ?
The safety of using ELIDEL Cream for a long period of time is not known .
A very small number of people who have used ELIDEL Cream have had cancer ( for example , skin or lymphoma ) .
However , a link with ELIDEL Cream use has not been shown .
Because of this concern : • A patient should not use ELIDEL Cream continuously for a long time .
• ELIDEL Cream should be used only on areas of skin that have eczema .
• ELIDEL Cream is not for use on a child under 2 years old .
How should a patient use ELIDEL Cream ?
• A patient should use ELIDEL Cream exactly as prescribed .
• A patient should use ELIDEL Cream only on areas of skin that have eczema .
• A patient should use ELIDEL Cream for short periods , and if needed , treatment may be repeated with breaks in between .
• A patient should stop ELIDEL Cream when the signs and symptoms of eczema , such as itching , rash , and redness go away , or as directed by the physician .
• A patient should follow the physician ’ s advice if symptoms of eczema return after a treatment with ELIDEL Cream .
• A patient should contact the physician if : • symptoms get worse with ELIDEL Cream • the patient gets a skin infection • symptoms do not improve after 6 weeks of treatment To apply ELIDEL Cream : • A patient or caregiver should wash their hands before using ELIDEL Cream .
When applying ELIDEL Cream after a bath or shower , the skin should be dry .
• A patient or caregiver should apply a thin layer of ELIDEL Cream only to the affected skin areas , twice a day , as directed by the physician .
• A patient or caregiver should use the smallest amount of ELIDEL Cream needed to control the signs and symptoms of eczema .
• Caregivers applying ELIDEL Cream to a patient , or a patient who is not treating the hands should wash their hands with soap and water after applying ELIDEL Cream .
This should remove any cream left on the hands .
• A patient should not bathe , shower or swim right after applying ELIDEL Cream .
This could wash off the cream .
• A patient can use moisturizers with ELIDEL Cream .
They should be sure to check with the physician first about the products that are right for them .
Because the skin of patients with eczema can be very dry , it is important they keep up good skin care practices .
If a patient uses moisturizers , he or she should apply them after ELIDEL Cream .
What should a patient avoid while using ELIDEL Cream ?
• A patient should not use sun lamps , tanning beds , or get treatment with ultraviolet light therapy during treatment with ELIDEL Cream .
• A patient should limit sun exposure during treatment with ELIDEL Cream even when the medicine is not on the skin .
If a patient needs to be outdoors after applying ELIDEL Cream , the patient should wear loose fitting clothing that protects the treated area from the sun .
The physician should advise the patient about other types of protection from the sun .
• A patient should not cover the skin being treated with bandages , dressings or wraps .
A patient can wear normal clothing .
• A patient should not use ELIDEL Cream in the eyes .
If ELIDEL Cream gets in the eyes , a patient should rinse them with cold water .
• A patient should not swallow ELIDEL Cream and should contact the physician if they do .
Drug Interactions Potential interactions between ELIDEL and other drugs , including immunizations , have not been systematically evaluated .
Due to low blood levels of pimecrolimus detected in some patients after topical application , systemic drug interactions are not expected , but cannot be ruled out .
The concomitant administration of known CYP3A family of inhibitors in patients with widespread and / or erythrodermic disease should be done with caution .
Some examples of such drugs are erythromycin , itraconazole , ketoconazole , fluconazole , calcium channel blockers and cimetidine .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 2 - year rat dermal carcinogenicity study using ELIDEL Cream , a statistically significant increase in the incidence of follicular cell adenoma of the thyroid was noted in low , mid and high dose male animals compared to vehicle and saline control male animals .
Follicular cell adenoma of the thyroid was noted in the dermal rat carcinogenicity study at the lowest dose of 2 mg / kg / day [ 0 . 2 % pimecrolimus cream ; 1 . 5 X the Maximum Recommended Human Dose ( MRHD ) based on AUC comparisons ] .
No increase in the incidence of follicular cell adenoma of the thyroid was noted in the oral carcinogenicity study in male rats up to 10 mg / kg / day ( 66 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
However , oral studies may not reflect continuous exposure or the same metabolic profile as by the dermal route .
In a mouse dermal carcinogenicity study using pimecrolimus in an ethanolic solution , no increase in incidence of neoplasms was observed in the skin or other organs up to the highest dose of 4 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 32 % pimecrolimus in ethanol ) 27 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons .
However , lymphoproliferative changes ( including lymphoma ) were noted in a 13 week repeat dose dermal toxicity study conducted in mice using pimecrolimus in an ethanolic solution at a dose of 25 mg / kg / day ( 47 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No lymphoproliferative changes were noted in this study at a dose of 10 mg / kg / day ( 17 X MRHD based on AUC comparison ) .
However , the latency time to lymphoma formation was shortened to 8 weeks after dermal administration of pimecrolimus dissolved in ethanol at a dose of 100 mg / kg / day ( 179 - 217 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
In a mouse oral ( gavage ) carcinogenicity study , a statistically significant increase in the incidence of lymphoma was noted in high dose male and female animals compared to vehicle control male and female animals .
Lymphomas were noted in the oral mouse carcinogenicity study at a dose of 45 mg / kg / day ( 258 - 340 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No drug - related tumors were noted in the mouse oral carcinogenicity study at a dose of 15 mg / kg / day ( 60 - 133 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
In an oral ( gavage ) rat carcinogenicity study , a statistically significant increase in the incidence of benign thymoma was noted in 10 mg / kg / day pimecrolimus treated male and female animals compared to vehicle control treated male and female animals .
In addition , a significant increase in the incidence of benign thymoma was noted in another oral ( gavage ) rat carcinogenicity study in 5 mg / kg / day pimecrolimus treated male animals compared to vehicle control treated male animals .
No drug - related tumors were noted in the rat oral carcinogenicity study at a dose of 1 mg / kg / day male animals ( 1 . 1 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) and at a dose of 5 mg / kg / day for female animals ( 21 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
In a 52 - week dermal photo - carcinogenicity study , the median time to onset of skin tumor formation was decreased in hairless mice following chronic topical dosing with concurrent exposure to UV radiation ( 40 weeks of treatment followed by 12 weeks of observation ) with the ELIDEL Cream vehicle alone .
No additional effect on tumor development beyond the vehicle effect was noted with the addition of the active ingredient , pimecrolimus , to the vehicle cream .
A 39 - week oral monkey toxicology study was conducted with pimecrolimus doses of 15 , 45 and 120 mg / kg / day .
A dose dependent increase in expression of immunosuppressive - related lymphoproliferative disorder ( IRLD ) associated with lymphocryptovirus ( a monkey strain of virus related to human Epstein Barr virus ) was observed .
IRLD in monkeys mirrors what has been noted in human transplant patients after chronic systemic immunosuppressive therapy , post transplantation lymphoproliferative disease ( PTLD ) , after treatment with chronic systemic immunosuppressive therapy .
Both IRLD and PTLD can progress to lymphoma , which is dependent on the dose and duration of systemic immunosuppressive therapy .
A dose dependent increase in opportunistic infections ( a signal of systemic immunosuppression ) was also noted in this monkey study .
A no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) for IRLD and opportunistic infections was not established in this study .
IRLD occurred at the lowest dose of 15 mg / kg / day for 39 weeks [ 31 X the Maximum Recommended Human Dose ( MRHD ) of ELIDEL Cream based on AUC comparisons ] in this study .
A partial recovery from IRLD was noted upon cessation of dosing in this study .
A battery of in vitro genotoxicity tests , including Ames assay , mouse lymphoma L5178Y assay , and chromosome aberration test in V79 Chinese hamster cells and an in vivo mouse micronucleus test revealed no evidence for a mutagenic or clastogenic potential for the drug .
An oral fertility and embryofetal developmental study in rats revealed estrus cycle disturbances , post - implantation loss and reduction in litter size at the 45 mg / kg / day dose ( 38 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No effect on fertility in female rats was noted at 10 mg / kg / day ( 12 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No effect on fertility in male rats was noted at 45 mg / kg / day ( 23 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) , which was the highest dose tested in this study .
A second oral fertility and embryofetal developmental study in rats revealed reduced testicular and epididymal weights , reduced testicular sperm counts and motile sperm for males and estrus cycle disturbances , decreased corpora lutea , decreased implantations and viable fetuses for females at 45 mg / kg / day dose ( 123 X MRHD for males and 192 X MRHD for females based on AUC comparisons ) .
No effect on fertility in female rats was noted at 10 mg / kg / day ( 5 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No effect on fertility in male rats was noted at 2 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 7 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of topically administered pimecrolimus in pregnant women .
The experience with ELIDEL Cream when used by pregnant women is too limited to permit assessment of the safety of its use during pregnancy .
In dermal embryofetal developmental studies , no maternal or fetal toxicity was observed up to the highest practicable doses tested , 10 mg / kg / day ( 1 % pimecrolimus cream ) in rats ( 0 . 14 X MRHD based on body surface area ) and 10 mg / kg / day ( 1 % pimecrolimus cream ) in rabbits ( 0 . 65 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
The 1 % pimecrolimus cream was administered topically for 6 hours / day during the period of organogenesis in rats and rabbits ( gestational days 6 - 21 in rats and gestational days 6 - 20 in rabbits ) .
A second dermal embryofetal development study was conducted in rats using pimecrolimus cream applied dermally to pregnant rats ( 1 g cream / kg body weight of 0 . 2 % , 0 . 6 % and 1 . 0 % pimecrolimus cream ) from gestation day 6 to 17 at doses of 2 , 6 , and 10 mg / kg / day with daily exposure of approximately 22 hours .
No maternal , reproductive , or embryo - fetal toxicity attributable to pimecrolimus was noted at 10 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 66 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) , the highest dose evaluated in this study .
No teratogenicity was noted in this study at any dose .
A combined oral fertility and embryofetal developmental study was conducted in rats and an oral embryofetal developmental study was conducted in rabbits .
Pimecrolimus was administered during the period of organogenesis ( 2 weeks prior to mating until gestational day 16 in rats , gestational days 6 - 18 in rabbits ) up to dose levels of 45 mg / kg / day in rats and 20 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
In the absence of maternal toxicity , indicators of embryofetal toxicity ( post - implantation loss and reduction in litter size ) were noted at 45 mg / kg / day ( 38 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) in the oral fertility and embryofetal developmental study conducted in rats .
No malformations in the fetuses were noted at 45 mg / kg / day ( 38 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) in this study .
No maternal toxicity , embryotoxicity or teratogenicity were noted in the oral rabbit embryofetal developmental toxicity study at 20 mg / kg / day ( 3 . 9 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) , which was the highest dose tested in this study .
A second oral embryofetal development study was conducted in rats .
Pimecrolimus was administered during the period of organogenesis ( gestational days 6 – 17 ) at doses of 2 , 10 and 45 mg / kg / day .
Maternal toxicity , embryolethality and fetotoxicity were noted at 45 mg / kg / day ( 271 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
A slight increase in skeletal variations that were indicative of delayed skeletal ossification was also noted at this dose .
No maternal toxicity , embryolethality or fetotoxicity were noted at 10 mg / kg / day ( 16 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No teratogenicity was noted in this study at any dose .
A second oral embryofetal development study was conducted in rabbits .
Pimecrolimus was administered during the period of organogenesis ( gestational days 7 – 20 ) at doses of 2 , 6 and 20 mg / kg / day .
Maternal toxicity , embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity were noted at 20 mg / kg / day ( 12 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
A slight increase in skeletal variations that were indicative of delayed skeletal ossification was also noted at this dose .
No maternal toxicity , embryotoxicity or fetotoxicity were noted at 6 mg / kg / day ( 5 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No teratogenicity was noted in this study at any dose .
An oral peri - and post - natal developmental study was conducted in rats .
Pimecrolimus was administered from gestational day 6 through lactational day 21 up to a dose level of 40 mg / kg / day .
Only 2 of 22 females delivered live pups at the highest dose of 40 mg / kg / day .
Postnatal survival , development of the F1 generation , their subsequent maturation and fertility were not affected at 10 mg / kg / day ( 12 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) , the highest dose evaluated in this study .
Pimecrolimus was transferred across the placenta in oral rat and rabbit embryofetal developmental studies .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used only if clearly needed during pregnancy .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from pimecrolimus , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use ELIDEL Cream is not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of age .
The long - term safety and effects of ELIDEL Cream on the developing immune system are unknown ( see WARNINGS , boxed WARNING , and INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) .
Three Phase 3 pediatric studies were conducted involving 1 , 114 patients 2 - 17 years of age .
Two studies were 6 - week randomized vehicle - controlled studies with a 20 - week open - label phase and one was a vehicle - controlled ( up to 1 year ) safety study with the option for sequential topical corticosteroid use .
Of these patients 542 ( 49 % ) were 2 - 6 years of age .
In the short - term studies , 11 % of ELIDEL patients did not complete these studies and 1 . 5 % of ELIDEL patients discontinued due to adverse events .
In the one - year study , 32 % of ELIDEL patients did not complete this study and 3 % of ELIDEL patients discontinued due to adverse events .
Most discontinuations were due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect .
The most common local adverse event in the short - term studies of ELIDEL Cream in pediatric patients ages 2 - 17 was application site burning ( 10 % vs . 13 % vehicle ) ; the incidence in the long - term study was 9 % ELIDEL vs . 7 % vehicle ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Adverse events that were more frequent ( > 5 % ) in patients treated with ELIDEL Cream compared to vehicle were headache ( 14 % vs . 9 % ) in the short - term trial .
Nasopharyngitis ( 26 % vs . 21 % ) , influenza ( 13 % vs . 4 % ) , pharyngitis ( 8 % vs . 3 % ) , viral infection ( 7 % vs . 1 % ) , pyrexia ( 13 % vs . 5 % ) , cough ( 16 % vs . 11 % ) , and headache ( 25 % vs . 16 % ) were increased over vehicle in the 1 - year safety study ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
In 843 patients ages 2 - 17 years treated with ELIDEL Cream , 9 ( 0 . 8 % ) developed eczema herpeticum ( 5 on ELIDEL Cream alone and 4 on ELIDEL Cream used in sequence with corticosteroids ) .
In 211 patients on vehicle alone , there were no cases of eczema herpeticum .
The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity .
Two Phase 3 studies were conducted involving 436 infants age 3 months - 23 months .
One 6 - week randomized vehicle - controlled study with a 20 - week open - label phase and one safety study , up to one year , were conducted .
In the 6 - week study , 11 % of ELIDEL and 48 % of vehicle patients did not complete this study ; no patient in either group discontinued due to adverse events .
Infants on ELIDEL Cream had an increased incidence of some adverse events compared to vehicle .
In the 6 - week vehicle - controlled study these adverse events included pyrexia ( 32 % vs . 13 % vehicle ) , URI ( 24 % vs . 14 % ) , nasopharyngitis ( 15 % vs . 8 % ) , gastroenteritis ( 7 % vs . 3 % ) , otitis media ( 4 % vs . 0 % ) , and diarrhea ( 8 % vs . 0 % ) .
In the open - label phase of the study , for infants who switched to ELIDEL Cream from vehicle , the incidence of the above - cited adverse events approached or equaled the incidence of those patients who remained on ELIDEL Cream .
In the 6 month safety data , 16 % of ELIDEL and 35 % of vehicle patients discontinued early and 1 . 5 % of ELIDEL and 0 % of vehicle patients discontinued due to adverse events .
Infants on ELIDEL Cream had a greater incidence of some adverse events as compared to vehicle .
These included pyrexia ( 30 % vs . 20 % ) , URI ( 21 % vs . 17 % ) , cough ( 15 % vs . 9 % ) , hypersensitivity ( 8 % vs . 2 % ) , teething ( 27 % vs . 22 % ) , vomiting ( 9 % vs . 4 % ) , rhinitis ( 13 % vs . 9 % ) , viral rash ( 4 % vs . 0 % ) , rhinorrhea ( 4 % vs . 0 % ) , and wheezing ( 4 % vs . 0 % ) .
Geriatric Use Nine ( 9 ) patients ≥ 65 years old received ELIDEL Cream in Phase 3 studies .
Clinical studies of ELIDEL did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to assess efficacy and safety .
ADVERSE REACTIONS No phototoxicity and no photoallergenicity were detected in clinical studies with 24 and 33 normal volunteers , respectively .
In human dermal safety studies , ELIDEL ® ( pimecrolimus ) Cream 1 % did not induce contact sensitization or cumulative irritation .
In a one - year safety study in pediatric patients age 2 - 17 years old involving sequential use of ELIDEL Cream and a topical corticosteroid , 43 % of ELIDEL patients and 68 % of vehicle patients used corticosteroids during the study .
Corticosteroids were used for more than 7 days by 34 % of ELIDEL patients and 54 % of vehicle patients .
An increased incidence of impetigo , skin infection , superinfection ( infected atopic dermatitis ) , rhinitis , and urticaria were found in the patients that had used ELIDEL Cream and topical corticosteroid sequentially as compared to ELIDEL Cream alone .
In 3 randomized , double - blind vehicle - controlled pediatric studies and one active - controlled adult study , 843 and 328 patients respectively , were treated with ELIDEL Cream .
In these clinical trials , 48 ( 4 % ) of the 1 , 171 ELIDEL patients and 13 ( 3 % ) of 408 vehicle - treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events .
Discontinuations for AEs were primarily due to application site reactions , and cutaneous infections .
The most common application site reaction was application site burning , which occurred in 8 % - 26 % of patients treated with ELIDEL Cream .
The following table depicts the incidence of adverse events pooled across the 2 identically designed 6 - week studies with their open label extensions and the 1 - year safety study for pediatric patients ages 2 - 17 .
Data from the adult active - controlled study is also included in this table .
Adverse events are listed regardless of relationship to study drug .
