( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Monitoring : Continuously monitor patients while receiving Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection .
( 5 . 1 ) • Bradycardia and Sinus Arrest : Have occurred in young healthy volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration , e . g . , rapid intravenous or bolus administration .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypotension and Bradycardia : May necessitate medical intervention .
May be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia , diabetes mellitus , or chronic hypertension , and in the elderly .
Use with caution in patients with advanced heart block or severe ventricular dysfunction .
( 5 . 2 ) • Co - administration with Other Vasodilators or Negative Chronotropic Agents : Use with caution due to additive pharmacodynamic effects .
( 5 . 2 ) • Transient Hypertension : Observed primarily during the loading dose .
Consider reduction in loading infusion rate .
( 5 . 3 ) • Arousability : Patients can become aroused / alert with stimulation ; this alone should not be considered as lack of efficacy .
( 5 . 4 ) • Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis : Prolonged exposure to dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours may be associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose - related increase in adverse events .
( 5 . 6 ) 5 . 1 Drug Administration Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the intensive care or operating room setting .
Due to the known pharmacological effects of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection , patients should be continuously monitored while receiving dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection .
5 . 2 Hypotension , Bradycardia , and Sinus Arrest Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection administration in young , healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration .
Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection infusion .
Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities .
If medical intervention is required , treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection , increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration , elevation of the lower extremities , and use of pressor agents .
Because dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli , clinicians should be prepared to intervene .
The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents ( e . g . , glycopyrrolate , atropine ) should be considered to modify vagal tone .
In clinical trials , glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride induced bradycardia .
However , in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction , more advanced resuscitative measures were required .
Caution should be exercised when administering dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection to patients with advanced heart block and / or severe ventricular dysfunction .
Because dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection decreases sympathetic nervous system activity , hypotension and / or bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia , diabetes mellitus , or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients .
In clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co - administered with dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed .
Nonetheless , caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection .
5 . 3 Transient Hypertension Transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection .
Treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary , although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable .
5 . 4 Arousability Some patients receiving dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated .
This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms .
5 . 5 Withdrawal Intensive Care Unit Sedation With administration up to 7 days , regardless of dose , 12 ( 5 % ) dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection adult subjects experienced at least 1 event related to withdrawal within the first 24 hours after discontinuing study drug and 7 ( 3 % ) dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection adult subjects experienced at least 1 event 24 to 48 hours after end of study drug .
The most common events were nausea , vomiting , and agitation .
In adult subjects , tachycardia and hypertension requiring intervention in the 48 hours following study drug discontinuation occurred at frequencies of < 5 % .
If tachycardia and / or hypertension occurs after discontinuation of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection supportive therapy is indicated .
Procedural Sedation In adult subjects , withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of short term infusions of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection ( < 6 hours ) .
5 . 6 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis Use of dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours has been associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose - related increase in adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Since dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment , dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Hypotension , bradycardia and sinus arrest [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Transient hypertension [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • The most common adverse reactions ( incidence > 2 % ) are hypotension , bradycardia , and dry mouth .
( 6 . 1 ) • Adverse reactions associated with infusions > 24 hours in duration include ARDS , respiratory failure , and agitation .

Reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection or the concomitant medication may be required .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Anesthetics , Sedatives , Hypnotics , Opioids Co - administration of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection with anesthetics , sedatives , hypnotics , and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects .
Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane , isoflurane , propofol , alfentanil , and midazolam .
No pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection and isoflurane , propofol , alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated .
However , due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions , when co - administered with dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection , a reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection or the concomitant anesthetic , sedative , hypnotic or opioid may be required .
7 . 2 Neuromuscular Blockers In one study of 10 healthy adult volunteers , administration of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of one ng / mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when administered to a nursing woman .
( 8 . 3 ) • Geriatric Patients : Dose reduction should be considered .
( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 , 5 . 2 , 8 . 5 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Dose reduction should be considered .
( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 , 5 . 7 , 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection use in pregnant women .
In an in vitro human placenta study , placental transfer of dexmedetomidine occurred .
In a study in the pregnant rat , placental transfer of dexmedetomidine was observed when radiolabeled dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously .
Thus , fetal exposure should be expected in humans , and dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus .
Teratogenic effects were not observed in rats following subcutaneous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis ( from gestation day 5 to 16 ) with doses up to 200 mcg / kg ( representing a dose approximately equal to the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area ) or in rabbits following intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis ( from gestation day 6 to 18 ) with doses up to 96 mcg / kg ( representing approximately half the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose based on plasma area under the time - curve comparison ) .
However , fetal toxicity , as evidenced by increased post - implantation losses and reduced live pups , was observed in rats at a subcutaneous dose of 200 mcg / kg .
The no - effect dose in rats was 20 mcg / kg ( representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison ) .
In another reproductive toxicity study when dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats at 8 and 32 mcg / kg ( representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison ) from gestation day 16 through weaning , lower offspring weights were observed .
Additionally , when offspring of the 32 mcg / kg group were allowed to mate , elevated fetal and embryocidal toxicity and delayed motor development was observed in second generation offspring .
8 . 2 Labor & Delivery The safety of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection during labor and delivery has not been studied .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether dexmedetomidine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk .
Radio - labeled dexmedetomidine administered subcutaneously to lactating female rats was excreted in milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy have not been established for Procedural or ICU Sedation in pediatric patients .
One assessor - blinded trial in pediatric patients and two open label studies in neonates were conducted to assess efficacy for ICU sedation .
These studies did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints and the safety data submitted were insufficient to fully characterize the safety profile of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection for this patient population .
The use of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection for procedural sedation in pediatric patients has not been evaluated .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Intensive Care Unit Sedation A total of 729 patients in the clinical studies were 65 years of age and over .
A total of 200 patients were 75 years of age and over .
In patients greater than 65 years of age , a higher incidence of bradycardia and hypotension was observed following administration of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Therefore , a dose reduction may be considered in patients over 65 years of age [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Procedural Sedation A total of 131 patients in the clinical studies were 65 years of age and over .
A total of 47 patients were 75 years of age and over .
Hypotension occurred in a higher incidence in dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection - treated patients 65 years or older ( 72 % ) and 75 years or older ( 74 % ) as compared to patients < 65 years ( 47 % ) .
A reduced loading dose of 0 . 5 mcg / kg given over 10 minutes is recommended and a reduction in the maintenance infusion should be considered for patients greater than 65 years of age .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Since dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection clearance decreases with increasing severity of hepatic impairment , dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection ( dexmedetomidine hydrochloride ) is not a controlled substance .
9 . 3 Dependence The dependence potential of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection has not been studied in humans .
However , since studies in rodents and primates have demonstrated that dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection exhibits pharmacologic actions similar to those of clonidine , it is possible that dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection may produce a clonidine - like withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE The tolerability of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection was studied in one study in which healthy adult subjects were administered doses at and above the recommended dose of 0 . 2 to 0 . 7 mcg / kg / hr .
The maximum blood concentration achieved in this study was approximately 13 times the upper boundary of the therapeutic range .
The most notable effects observed in two subjects who achieved the highest doses were first degree atrioventricular block and second degree heart block .
No hemodynamic compromise was noted with the atrioventricular block and the heart block resolved spontaneously within one minute .
Five adult patients received an overdose of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection in the intensive care unit sedation studies .
Two of these patients had no symptoms reported ; one patient received a 2 mcg / kg loading dose over 10 minutes ( twice the recommended loading dose ) and one patient received a maintenance infusion of 0 . 8 mcg / kg / hr .
Two other patients who received a 2 mcg / kg loading dose over 10 minutes , experienced bradycardia and / or hypotension .
One patient who received a loading bolus dose of undiluted dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection ( 19 . 4 mcg / kg ) , had cardiac arrest from which he was successfully resuscitated .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection is a relatively selective alpha2 - adrenergic agonist with sedative properties .
Alpha2 selectivity is observed in animals following slow intravenous infusion of low and medium doses ( 10 - 300 mcg / kg ) .
Both alpha1 and alpha2 activity is observed following slow intravenous infusion of high doses ( ≥ 1 , 000 mcg / kg ) or with rapid intravenous administration .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a study in healthy volunteers ( N = 10 ) , respiratory rate and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits and there was no evidence of respiratory depression when dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection was administered by intravenous infusion at doses within the recommended dose range ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 7 mcg / kg / hr ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration , dexmedetomidine exhibits the following pharmacokinetic parameters : a rapid distribution phase with a distribution half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of approximately 6 minutes ; a terminal elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of approximately 2 hours ; and steady - state volume of distribution ( Vss ) of approximately 118 liters .
Clearance is estimated to be approximately 39 L / h .
The mean body weight associated with this clearance estimate was 72 kg .
Dexmedetomidine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the dosage range of 0 . 2 to 0 . 7 mcg / kg / hr when administered by intravenous infusion for up to 24 hours .
Table 8 shows the main pharmacokinetic parameters when dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection was infused ( after appropriate loading doses ) at maintenance infusion rates of 0 . 17 mcg / kg / hr ( target plasma concentration of 0 . 3 ng / mL ) for 12 and 24 hours , 0 . 33 mcg / kg / hr ( target plasma concentration of 0 . 6 ng / mL ) for 24 hours , and 0 . 70 mcg / kg / hr ( target plasma concentration of 1 . 25 ng / mL ) for 24 hours .

# Mean Css = Average steady - state concentration of dexmedetomidine .
The mean Css was calculated based on post - dose sampling from 2 . 5 to 9 hours samples for 12 hour infusion and post - dose sampling from 2 . 5 to 18 hours for 24 hour infusions .
The loading doses for each of the above indicated groups were 0 . 5 , 0 . 5 , 1 and 2 . 2 mcg / kg , respectively .
Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetic parameters after dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection maintenance doses of 0 . 2 to 1 . 4 mcg / kg / hr for > 24 hours were similar to the pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameters after dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection maintenance dosing for < 24 hours in other studies .
The values for clearance ( CL ) , volume of distribution ( V ) , and t1 / 2 were 39 . 4 L / hr , 152 L , and 2 . 67 hours , respectively .
Distribution The steady - state volume of distribution ( Vss ) of dexmedetomidine was approximately 118 liters .
Dexmedetomidine protein binding was assessed in the plasma of normal healthy male and female subjects .
The average protein binding was 94 % and was constant across the different plasma concentrations tested .
Protein binding was similar in males and females .
The fraction of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection that was bound to plasma proteins was significantly decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects .
The potential for protein binding displacement of dexmedetomidine by fentanyl , ketorolac , theophylline , digoxin and lidocaine was explored in vitro , and negligible changes in the plasma protein binding of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection were observed .
The potential for protein binding displacement of phenytoin , warfarin , ibuprofen , propranolol , theophylline and digoxin by dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection was explored in vitro and none of these compounds appeared to be significantly displaced by dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection .
Elimination Metabolism Dexmedetomidine undergoes almost complete biotransformation with very little unchanged dexmedetomidine excreted in urine and feces .
Biotransformation involves both direct glucuronidation as well as cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism .
The major metabolic pathways of dexmedetomidine are : direct N - glucuronidation to inactive metabolites ; aliphatic hydroxylation ( mediated primarily by CYP2A6 with a minor role of CYP1A2 , CYP2E1 , CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 ) of dexmedetomidine to generate 3 hydroxy - dexmedetomidine , the glucuronide of 3 - hydroxy - dexmedetomidine , and 3 - carboxy dexmedetomidine ; and N - methylation of dexmedetomidine to generate 3 - hydroxy N - methyl dexmedetomidine , 3 - carboxy N - methyl - dexmedetomidine , and dexmedetomidine - N - methyl O glucuronide .
Excretion The terminal elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of dexmedetomidine is approximately 2 hours and clearance is estimated to be approximately 39 L / h .
A mass balance study demonstrated that after nine days an average of 95 % of the radioactivity , following intravenous administration of radiolabeled dexmedetomidine , was recovered in the urine and 4 % in the feces .
No unchanged dexmedetomidine was detected in the urine .
Approximately 85 % of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was excreted within 24 hours after the infusion .
Fractionation of the radioactivity excreted in urine demonstrated that products of N - glucuronidation accounted for approximately 34 % of the cumulative urinary excretion .
In addition , aliphatic hydroxylation of parent drug to form 3 - hydroxy - dexmedetomidine , the glucuronide of 3 - hydroxy - dexmedetomidine , and 3 - carboxylic acid - dexmedetomidine together represented approximately 14 % of the dose in urine .
N - methylation of dexmedetomidine to form 3 - hydroxy N - methyl dexmedetomidine , 3 - carboxy N - methyl dexmedetomidine , and N - methyl O - glucuronide dexmedetomidine accounted for approximately 18 % of the dose in urine .
The N - Methyl metabolite itself was a minor circulating component and was undetected in urine .
Approximately 28 % of the urinary metabolites have not been identified .
Specific Populations Male and Female Patients There was no observed difference in dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection pharmacokinetics due to gender .
Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profile of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection was not altered by age .
There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection in young ( 18 – 40 years ) , middle age ( 41 – 65 years ) , and elderly ( > 65 years ) subjects .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment In subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A , B , or C ) , clearance values for dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection were lower than in healthy subjects .
The mean clearance values for patients with mild , moderate , and severe hepatic impairment were 74 % , 64 % and 53 % of those observed in the normal healthy subjects , respectively .
Mean clearances for free drug were 59 % , 51 % and 32 % of those observed in the normal healthy subjects , respectively .
Although dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection is dosed to effect , it may be necessary to consider dose reduction in subjects with hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Patients with Renal Impairment Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics ( Cmax , Tmax , AUC , t1 / 2 , CL , and Vss ) were not significantly different in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance : < 30 mL / min ) compared to healthy subjects .
Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies : In vitro studies in human liver microsomes demonstrated no evidence of cytochrome P450 mediated drug interactions that are likely to be of clinical relevance .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis Animal carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with dexmedetomidine .
Mutagenesis Dexmedetomidine was not mutagenic in vitro , in either the bacterial reverse mutation assay ( E . coli and Salmonella typhimurium ) or the mammalian cell forward mutation assay ( mouse lymphoma ) .
Dexmedetomidine was clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test with , but not without , rat S9 metabolic activation .
In contrast , dexmedetomidine was not clastogenic in the invitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test with or without human S9 metabolic activation .
Although dexmedetomidine was clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test in NMRI mice , there was no evidence of clastogenicity in CD - 1 mice .
Impairment of Fertility Fertility in male or female rats was not affected after daily subcutaneous injections of dexmedetomidine at doses up to 54 mcg / kg ( less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose on a mcg / m2 basis ) administered from 10 weeks prior to mating in males , and 3 weeks prior to mating and during mating in females .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology There were no differences in the adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) - stimulated cortisol response in dogs following a single dose of dexmedetomidine compared to saline control .
However , after continuous subcutaneous infusions of dexmedetomidine at 3 mcg / kg / hr and 10 mcg / kg / hr for one week in dogs ( exposures estimated to be within the clinical range ) , the ACTH - stimulated cortisol response was diminished by approximately 27 % and 40 % , respectively , compared to saline - treated control animals indicating a dose - dependent adrenal suppression .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection has been evaluated in four randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled multicenter clinical trials in 1 , 185 adult patients .
14 . 1 Intensive Care Unit Sedation Two randomized , double - blind , parallel - group , placebo - controlled multicenter clinical trials included 754 adult patients being treated in a surgical intensive care unit .
All patients were initially intubated and received mechanical ventilation .
These trials evaluated the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection by comparing the amount of rescue medication ( midazolam in one trial and propofol in the second ) required to achieve a specified level of sedation ( using the standardized Ramsay Sedation Scale ) between dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection and placebo from onset of treatment to extubation or to a total treatment duration of 24 hours .
The Ramsay Level of Sedation Scale is displayed in Table 9 .
Table 9 : Ramsay Level of Sedation Scale Clinical Score Level of Sedation Achieved 6 Asleep , no response 5 Asleep , sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus 4 Asleep , but with brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus 3 Patient responds to commands 2 Patient cooperative , oriented , and tranquil 1 Patient anxious , agitated , or restless In the first study , 175 adult patients were randomized to receive placebo and 178 to receive dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection by intravenous infusion at a dose of 0 . 4 mcg / kg / hr ( with allowed adjustment between 0 . 2 and 0 . 7 mcg / kg / hr ) following an initial loading infusion of one mcg / kg intravenous over 10 minutes .
The study drug infusion rate was adjusted to maintain a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 .
Patients were allowed to receive “ rescue ” midazolam as needed to augment the study drug infusion .
In addition , morphine sulfate was administered for pain as needed .
The primary outcome measure for this study was the total amount of rescue medication ( midazolam ) needed to maintain sedation as specified while intubated .
Patients randomized to placebo received significantly more midazolam than patients randomized to dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection ( see Table 10 ) .
A second prospective primary analysis assessed the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection by comparing the percentage of patients who achieved a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 during intubation without the use of additional rescue medication .
A significantly greater percentage of patients in the dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection group maintained a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 without receiving any midazolam rescue compared to the placebo group ( see Table 10 ) .

* ANOVA model with treatment center .
** Chi - square .
A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to patients in the dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection and placebo groups .
On average , dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection - treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo - treated patients ( 0 . 47 versus 0 . 83 mg / h ) .
In addition , 44 % ( 79 of 178 patients ) of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 19 % ( 33 of 175 patients ) in the placebo group .
In a second study , 198 adult patients were randomized to receive placebo and 203 to receive dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection by intravenous infusion at a dose of 0 . 4 mcg / kg / hr ( with allowed adjustment between 0 . 2 and 0 . 7 mcg / kg / hr ) following an initial loading infusion of one mcg / kg intravenous over 10 minutes .
The study drug infusion was adjusted to maintain a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 .
Patients were allowed to receive “ rescue ” propofol as needed to augment the study drug infusion .
In addition , morphine sulfate was administered as needed for pain .
The primary outcome measure for this study was the total amount of rescue medication ( propofol ) needed to maintain sedation as specified while intubated .
Patients randomized to placebo received significantly more propofol than patients randomized to dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection ( see Table 11 ) .
A significantly greater percentage of patients in the dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection group compared to the placebo group maintained a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 without receiving any propofol rescue ( see Table 11 ) .

** Chi - square A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to patients in the dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection and placebo groups .
On average , dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection - treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo - treated patients ( 0 . 43 versus 0 . 89 mg / h ) .
In addition , 41 % ( 83 of 203 patients ) of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 15 % ( 30 of 198 patients ) in the placebo group .
In a controlled clinical trial , dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection was compared to midazolam for ICU sedation exceeding 24 hours duration .
Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection was not shown to be superior to midazolam for the primary efficacy endpoint , the percent of time patients were adequately sedated ( 81 % versus 81 % ) .
In addition , administration of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection for longer than 24 hours was associated with tolerance , tachyphylaxis , and a dose - related increase in adverse events [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
14 . 2 Procedural Sedation The safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection for sedation of non - intubated patients prior to and / or during surgical and other procedures was evaluated in two randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled multicenter clinical trials .
Study 1 evaluated the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection in patients having a variety of elective surgeries / procedures performed under monitored anesthesia care .
Study 2 evaluated dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection in patients undergoing awake fiberoptic intubation prior to a surgical or diagnostic procedure .
In Study 1 , the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection were evaluated by comparing the percent of patients not requiring rescue midazolam to achieve a specified level of sedation using the standardized Observer ’ s Assessment of Alertness / Sedation Scale ( see Table 12 ) .

The maintenance infusion of study drug could be titrated from 0 . 2 mcg / kg / hr to 1 mcg / kg / hr to achieve the targeted sedation score ( Observer ’ s Assessment of Alertness / Sedation Scale ≤ 4 ) .
Patients were allowed to receive rescue midazolam as needed to achieve and / or maintain an Observer ’ s Assessment of Alertness / Sedation Scale ≤ 4 .
After achieving the desired level of sedation , a local or regional anesthetic block was performed .
Demographic characteristics were similar between the dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection and comparator groups .
Efficacy results showed that dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection was more effective than the comparator group when used to sedate non - intubated patients requiring monitored anesthesia care during surgical and other procedures ( see Table 13 ) .
In Study 2 , the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection were evaluated by comparing the percent of patients requiring rescue midazolam to achieve or maintain a specified level of sedation using the Ramsay Sedation Scale score ≥ 2 ( see Table 9 ) .
Patients were randomized to receive a loading infusion of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection 1 mcg / kg or placebo ( normal saline ) given over 10 minutes and followed by a fixed maintenance infusion of 0 . 7 mcg / kg / hr .
After achieving the desired level of sedation , topicalization of the airway occurred .
Patients were allowed to receive rescue midazolam as needed to achieve and / or maintain a Ramsay Sedation Scale ≥ 2 .
Demographic characteristics were similar between the dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection and comparator groups .
