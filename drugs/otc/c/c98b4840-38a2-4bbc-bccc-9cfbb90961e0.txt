These studies have not identified an adverse effect on maternal outcomes or infant Apgar scores [ see Data ] .
There are no data on the use of phenylephrine during the first or second trimester .
In animal reproduction and development studies in normotensive animals , evidence of fetal malformations was noted when phenylephrine was administered during organogenesis via a 1 - hour infusion at 1 . 2 times the human daily dose ( HDD ) of 10 mg / 60 kg / day .
Decreased pup weights were noted in offspring of pregnant rats treated with 2 . 9 times the HDD [ See Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryofetal Risk Untreated hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia for Cesarean section is associated with an increase in maternal nausea and vomiting .
A sustained decrease in uterine blood flow due to maternal hypotension may result in fetal bradycardia and acidosis .
Data Human Data Published randomized controlled trials over several decades , which compared the use of phenylephrine hydrochloride injection to other similar agents in pregnant women during Cesarean section , have not identified adverse maternal or infant outcomes .
At recommended doses , phenylephrine does not appear to affect fetal heart rate or fetal heart rate variability to a significant degree .
There are no studies on the safety of phenylephrine hydrochloride injection exposure during the period of organogenesis , and therefore , it is not possible to draw any conclusions on the risk of birth defects following exposure to phenylephrine hydrochloride injection during pregnancy .
In addition , there are no data on the risk of miscarriage following fetal exposure to phenylephrine hydrochloride injection .
Animal Data No clear malformations or fetal toxicity were reported when normotensive pregnant rabbits were treated with phenylephrine via continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour ( 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ; approximately equivalent to a HDD based on body surface area ) from Gestation Day 7 to 19 .
At this dose , which demonstrated no maternal toxicity , there was evidence of developmental delay ( altered ossification of sternebra ) .
In a non - GLP dose range - finding study in normotensive pregnant rabbits , fetal lethality and cranial , paw , and limb malformations were noted following treatment with 1 . 2 mg / kg / day of phenylephrine via continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour ( 2 . 3 - times the HDD ) .
This dose was clearly maternally toxic ( increased mortality and significant body weight loss ) .
An increase in the incidence of limb malformation ( hyperextension of the forepaw ) coincident with high fetal mortality was noted in a single litter at 0 . 6 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 2 - times the HDD ) in the absence of maternal toxicity .
No malformations or embryo - fetal toxicity were reported when normotensive pregnant rats were treated with up to 3 mg / kg / day phenylephrine via continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour ( 2 . 9 - times the HDD ) from Gestation Day 6 to 17 .
This dose was associated with some maternal toxicity ( decreased food consumption and body weights ) .
Decreased pup weights were reported in a pre - and postnatal development toxicity study in which normotensive pregnant rats were administered phenylephrine via continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour ( 0 . 3 , 1 . 0 , or 3 . 0 mg / kg / day ; 0 . 29 , 1 , or 2 . 9 times the HDD ) from Gestation Day 6 through Lactation Day 21 ) .
No adverse effects on growth and development ( learning and memory , sexual development , and fertility ) were noted in the offspring of pregnant rats at any dose tested .
Maternal toxicities ( mortality late in gestation and during lactation period , decreased food consumption and body weight ) occurred at 1 and 3 mg / kg / day of phenylephrine ( equivalent to and 2 . 9 times the HDD , respectively ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of phenylephrine hydrochloride or its metabolite in human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for phenylephrine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenylephrine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of phenylephrine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment In patients with liver cirrhosis [ Child Pugh Class B and Class C ] , dose - response data indicate decreased responsiveness to phenylephrine .
Start dosing in the recommended dose range , but more phenylephrine may be needed in this population .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment In patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , dose - response data indicate increased responsiveness to phenylephrine .
Consider starting at the lower end of the recommended dose range , and adjusting dose based on the target blood pressure goal .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdose of phenylephrine hydrochloride can cause a rapid rise in blood pressure .
Symptoms of overdose include headache , vomiting , hypertension , reflex bradycardia , a sensation of fullness in the head , tingling of the extremities , and cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular extrasystoles and ventricular tachycardia .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Phenylephrine hydrochloride is an α - 1 adrenergic receptor agonist .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Interaction of phenylephrine with α - 1 - adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells causes activation of the cells and results in vasoconstriction .
Following phenylephrine hydrochloride intravenous administration , increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures , mean arterial blood pressure , and total peripheral vascular resistance are observed .
The onset of blood pressure increase following an intravenous bolus phenylephrine hydrochloride administration is rapid , typically within minutes .
As blood pressure increases following intravenous administration , vagal activity also increases , resulting in reflex bradycardia .
Phenylephrine has activity on most vascular beds , including renal , pulmonary , and splanchnic arteries .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following an intravenous infusion of phenylephrine hydrochloride , the observed effective half - life was approximately 5 minutes .
The steady - state volume of distribution of approximately 340 L suggests a high distribution into organs and peripheral tissues .
The average total serum clearance is approximately 2100 mL / min .
The observed phenylephrine plasma terminal elimination half - life was 2 . 5 hours .
Phenylephrine is metabolized primarily by monoamine oxidase and sulfotransferase .
After intravenous administration of radiolabeled phenylephrine , approximately 80 % of the total dose was eliminated within first 12 hours ; and approximately 86 % of the total dose was recovered in the urine within 48 hours .
The excreted unchanged parent drug was 16 % of the total dose in the urine at 48 hours post intravenous administration .
There are two major metabolites , with approximately 57 and 8 % of the total dose excreted as m - hydroxymandelic acid and sulfate conjugates , respectively .
The metabolites are considered not pharmacologically active .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term animal studies that evaluated the carcinogenic potential of orally administered phenylephrine hydrochloride in F344 / N rats and B6C3F1 mice were completed by the National Toxicology Program using the dietary route of administration .
There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in mice administered approximately 270 mg / kg / day ( 131 - times the human daily dose ( HDD ) of 10 mg / 60 kg / day based on body surface area ) or rats administered approximately 50 mg / kg / day ( 48 times HDD ) based on body surface area comparisons .
Mutagenesis Phenylephrine hydrochloride tested negative in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay ( S . typhimurium strains TA98 , TA100 , TA1535 and TA1537 ) , the in vitro chromosomal aberrations assay , the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay , and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay .
Positive results were reported in only one of two replicates of the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay .
Impairment of Fertility Phenylephrine did not impair mating , fertility , or reproductive outcome in normotensive male rats treated with 3 mg / kg / day phenylephrine via continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour ( 2 . 9 times the HDD ) for 28 days prior to mating and for a minimum of 63 days prior to sacrifice and female rats treated with the same dosing regimen for 14 days prior to mating and through Gestation Day 6 .
This dose was associated with increased mortality in both male and female rats and decreased body weight gain in treated males .
There were decreased caudal sperm density and increased abnormal sperm reported in males treated with 3 mg / kg / day phenylephrine ( 2 . 9 times the HDD ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The evidence for the efficacy of phenylephrine hydrochloride injection is derived from studies of phenylephrine hydrochloride in the published literature .
The literature support includes 16 studies evaluating the use of intravenous phenylephrine to treat hypotension during anesthesia .
The 16 studies include 9 studies where phenylephrine was used in low - risk ( ASA 1 and 2 ) pregnant women undergoing neuraxial anesthesia during Cesarean delivery , 6 studies in non - obstetric surgery under general anesthesia , and 1 study in non - obstetric surgery under combined general and neuraxial anesthesia .
Phenylephrine has been shown to raise systolic and mean blood pressure when administered either as a bolus dose or by continuous infusion following the development of hypotension during anesthesia .
