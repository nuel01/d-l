Patients must have been on a stable dose of background HES therapy for the 4 weeks prior to randomization [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
Of the patients enrolled , 53 % were female , 93 % were White , and ages ranged from 12 to 82 years .
No additional adverse reactions were identified to those reported in the severe asthma trials .
Systemic Reactions , including Hypersensitivity Reactions In the trial , no systemic allergic ( type I hypersensitivity ) reactions were reported .
Other systemic reactions were reported by 1 ( 2 % ) patient in the group receiving 300 mg of NUCALA and no patients in the placebo group .
The reported manifestation of other systemic reaction was multifocal skin reaction experienced on the day of dosing .
Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions ( e . g . , burning , itching ) occurred at a rate of 7 % in patients receiving 300 mg of NUCALA compared with 4 % in patients receiving placebo .
6 . 5 Immunogenicity In adult and adolescent patients with severe asthma receiving NUCALA 100 mg , 15 / 260 ( 6 % ) had detectable anti - mepolizumab antibodies .
Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 1 patient with asthma receiving NUCALA 100 mg .
Anti - mepolizumab antibodies slightly increased ( approximately 20 % ) the clearance of mepolizumab .
There was no evidence of a correlation between anti - mepolizumab antibody titers and change in eosinophil level .
The clinical relevance of the presence of anti - mepolizumab antibodies is not known .
In the clinical trial of children aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma receiving NUCALA 40 or 100 mg , 2 / 35 ( 6 % ) had detectable anti ‑ mepolizumab antibodies during the initial short phase of the trial .
No children had detectable anti - mepolizumab antibodies during the long phase of the trial .
In patients with CRSwNP receiving NUCALA 100 mg , 6 / 196 ( 3 % ) had detectable anti - mepolizumab antibodies .
No neutralizing antibodies were detected in any patients with CRSwNP .
In patients with EGPA receiving 300 mg of NUCALA , 1 / 68 ( < 2 % ) had detectable anti - mepolizumab antibodies .
No neutralizing antibodies were detected in any patients with EGPA .
In adult and adolescent patients with HES receiving 300 mg of NUCALA , 1 / 53 ( 2 % ) had detectable anti - mepolizumab antibodies .
No neutralizing antibodies were detected in any patients with HES .
The reported frequency of anti - mepolizumab antibodies may underestimate the actual frequency due to lower assay sensitivity in the presence of high drug concentration .
The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to mepolizumab in specific assays .
The observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors , including assay sensitivity and specificity , assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
6 . 6 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials , the following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of NUCALA .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness , frequency of reporting , or causal connection to NUCALA or a combination of these factors .
Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Formal drug interaction trials have not been performed with NUCALA .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women with asthma exposed to NUCALA during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers can enroll patients or encourage patients to enroll themselves by calling 1 - 877 - 311 - 8972 or visiting www . mothertobaby . org / asthma .
Risk Summary The data on pregnancy exposure are insufficient to inform on drug - associated risk .
Monoclonal antibodies , such as mepolizumab , are transported across the placenta in a linear fashion as pregnancy progresses ; therefore , potential effects on a fetus are likely to be greater during the second and third trimester of pregnancy .
In a prenatal and postnatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys , there was no evidence of fetal harm with IV administration of mepolizumab throughout pregnancy at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 9 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 300 mg subcutaneous ( see Data ) .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryofetal Risk : In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma , evidence demonstrates that there is an increased risk of preeclampsia in the mother and prematurity , low birth weight , and small for gestational age in the neonate .
The level of asthma control should be closely monitored in pregnant women and treatment adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal control .
Data Animal Data : In a prenatal and postnatal development study , pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received mepolizumab from gestation Days 20 to 140 at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 9 times that achieved with the MRHD ( on an AUC basis with maternal IV doses up to 100 mg / kg once every 4 weeks ) .
Mepolizumab did not elicit adverse effects on fetal or neonatal growth ( including immune function ) up to 9 months after birth .
Examinations for internal or skeletal malformations were not performed .
Mepolizumab crossed the placenta in cynomolgus monkeys .
Concentrations of mepolizumab were approximately 2 . 4 times higher in infants than in mothers up to Day 178 postpartum .
Levels of mepolizumab in milk were ≤ 0 . 5 % of maternal serum concentration .
In a fertility , early embryonic , and embryofetal development study , pregnant CD - 1 mice received an analogous antibody , which inhibits the activity of murine interleukin - 5 ( IL - 5 ) , at an IV dose of 50 mg / kg once per week throughout gestation .
The analogous antibody was not teratogenic in mice .
Embryofetal development of IL - 5 – deficient mice has been reported to be generally unaffected relative to wild - type mice .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of mepolizumab in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
However , mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody ( IgG1 kappa ) , and immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) is present in human milk in small amounts .
Mepolizumab was present in the milk of cynomolgus monkeys postpartum following dosing during pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for NUCALA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from mepolizumab or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Severe Asthma The safety and effectiveness of NUCALA for severe asthma , and with an eosinophilic phenotype , have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older .
Use of NUCALA in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled trials in adults and adolescents .
A total of 28 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with severe asthma were enrolled in the Phase 3 asthma trials .
Of these , 25 were enrolled in the 32 - week exacerbation trial ( Trial 2 , NCT01691521 ) and had a mean age of 14 . 8 years .
Patients had a history of 2 or more exacerbations in the previous year despite regular use of medium - or high - dose ICS plus additional controller ( s ) with or without OCS and had blood eosinophils of ≥ 150 cells / mcL at screening or ≥ 300 cells / mcL within 12 months prior to enrollment .

Patients had a reduction in the rate of exacerbations that trended in favor of NUCALA .
Of the 19 adolescents who received NUCALA , 9 received 100 mg and the mean apparent clearance in these patients was 35 % less than that of adults .
The safety profile observed in adolescents was generally similar to that of the overall population in the Phase 3 studies [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Use of NUCALA in pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma , and with an eosinophilic phenotype , is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled trials in adults and adolescents with additional pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic , and safety data in children aged 6 to 11 years .
A single open - label clinical trial ( NCT02377427 ) was conducted in 36 children aged 6 to 11 years ( mean age : 8 . 6 years , 31 % female ) with severe asthma .
Enrollment criteria were the same as for adolescents in the 32 - week exacerbation trial ( Trial 2 ) .
Based upon the pharmacokinetic data from this trial , a dose of 40 mg subcutaneous every 4 weeks was determined to have similar exposure to adults and adolescents administered a dose of 100 mg subcutaneous [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The effectiveness of NUCALA in pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years is extrapolated from efficacy in adults and adolescents with support from pharmacokinetic analyses showing similar drug exposure levels for 40 mg administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks in children aged 6 to 11 years compared with adults and adolescents [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The safety profile and pharmacodynamic response observed in this trial for children aged 6 to 11 years were similar to that seen in adults and adolescents [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients aged younger than 6 years with severe asthma have not been established .
Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps The safety and effectiveness in patients aged younger than 18 years with CRSwNP have not been established .
Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis The safety and effectiveness in patients aged younger than 18 years with EGPA have not been established .
Hypereosinophilic Syndrome The safety and effectiveness of NUCALA for HES have been established in adolescent patients aged 12 years and older .
The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients aged younger than 12 years with HES have not been established .
Use of NUCALA for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well - controlled study ( NCT02836496 ) in adults and adolescents and an open - label extension study ( NCT03306043 ) .
One adolescent received NUCALA during the controlled study and this patient and an additional 3 adolescents received NUCALA during the open - label extension study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
The 1 adolescent treated with NUCALA in the 32 - week trial did not have a HES flare or an adverse event reported .
All adolescents received 300 mg of NUCALA for 20 weeks in the open - label extension .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of NUCALA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older that received NUCALA ( n = 79 ) to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
Based on available data , no adjustment of the dosage of NUCALA in geriatric patients is necessary , but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific treatment for an overdose with mepolizumab .
If overdose occurs , the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Mepolizumab is an IL - 5 antagonist ( IgG1 kappa ) .
IL - 5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and differentiation , recruitment , activation , and survival of eosinophils .
Mepolizumab binds to IL - 5 with a dissociation constant of 100 pM , inhibiting the bioactivity of IL - 5 by blocking its binding to the alpha chain of the IL - 5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface .
Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma , CRSwNP , EGPA , and HES .
Multiple cell types ( e . g . , mast cells , eosinophils , neutrophils , macrophages , lymphocytes ) and mediators ( e . g . , histamine , eicosanoids , leukotrienes , cytokines ) are involved in inflammation .
Mepolizumab , by inhibiting IL - 5 signaling , reduces the production and survival of eosinophils ; however , the mechanism of mepolizumab action in asthma , CRSwNP , EGPA , and HES has not been definitively established .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamic response ( blood eosinophil reduction ) following repeat doses of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously or intravenously was evaluated in adult subjects with asthma and blood eosinophil levels > 200 cells / mcL .
Subjects received 1 of 4 mepolizumab treatments ( administered every 28 days for a total of 3 doses ) : 12 . 5 mg subcutaneous , 125 mg subcutaneous , 250 mg subcutaneous , or 75 mg IV .
Sixty - six of the 70 randomized subjects completed the trial .
Compared with baseline levels , blood eosinophils decreased in a dose - dependent manner .
A reduction in blood eosinophil levels was observed in all treatment groups by Day 3 ( 48 hours post - dose ) .
On Day 84 ( 4 weeks post ‑ last dose ) , the observed geometric mean reduction from baseline in blood eosinophils was 64 % , 78 % , 84 % , and 90 % in the 12 . 5 - mg subcutaneous , 75 - mg IV , 125 - mg subcutaneous , and 250 - mg subcutaneous treatment groups , respectively .
The model - predicted subcutaneous doses providing 50 % and 90 % of maximal reduction of blood eosinophils at Day 84 were estimated to be 11 and 99 mg , respectively .
These results , along with the clinical efficacy data from the dose - ranging exacerbation trial in adult and adolescent subjects with severe asthma ( Trial 1 ) supported the evaluation of mepolizumab 75 mg IV and 100 mg subcutaneous in the confirmatory severe asthma trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Following subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab 100 mg every 4 weeks for 32 weeks in adult and adolescent subjects with severe asthma ( Trial 2 ) , blood eosinophils were reduced to a geometric mean count of 40 cells / mcL , which corresponds to a geometric mean reduction of 84 % compared with placebo .
The pharmacodynamic response ( blood eosinophil reduction ) was also evaluated in children aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma .
Following subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab 40 mg every 4 weeks for 52 weeks , blood eosinophils were reduced to a geometric mean count of 48 cells / mcL .
This corresponds to a geometric mean reduction from baseline of 85 % .
The magnitude of reduction in adults , adolescents , and children was observed within 4 weeks of treatment and was maintained throughout the treatment periods .
For adults with CRSwNP , following subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab 100 mg every 4 weeks for 52 weeks , blood eosinophils were reduced to a geometric mean count of 60 cells / mcL .
There was a geometric mean reduction of 83 % compared with placebo .
This magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of treatment and was maintained throughout the treatment period [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
For adults with EGPA , following subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks for 52 weeks , blood eosinophils were reduced to a geometric mean count of 38 cells / mcL .
There was a geometric mean reduction of 83 % compared with placebo , and this magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of treatment [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
For adults and adolescents with HES , following subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks for 32 weeks , blood eosinophils were reduced to a geometric mean count of 70 cells / mcL .
There was a geometric mean reduction of 92 % compared with placebo [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following subcutaneous dosing in adult subjects with asthma , mepolizumab exhibited approximately dose ‑ proportional pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 12 . 5 to 250 mg .
The pharmacokinetic properties of mepolizumab observed in subjects with CRSwNP ( adults ) , EGPA ( adults ) , or HES ( adults and adolescents ) were similar to the pharmacokinetic properties observed in subjects with severe asthma ( adults and adolescents ) .
Subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab 300 mg had approximately 3 times the systemic exposure of mepolizumab 100 mg .
Absorption Following 100 - mg subcutaneous administration in the upper arm of adult and adolescent subjects with asthma , the bioavailability of mepolizumab was estimated to be approximately 80 % .
Following repeat subcutaneous administration once every 4 weeks , there was approximately a 2 - fold accumulation at steady state .
Distribution The population central volume of distribution of mepolizumab in adult subjects with asthma is estimated to be 3 . 6 L for a 70 - kg individual .
Elimination Following subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab in adult subjects with asthma , the mean terminal half - life ( t1 / 2 ) ranged from 16 to 22 days .
The population apparent systemic clearance of mepolizumab in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma is estimated to be 0 . 28 L / day for a 70 - kg individual .
Metabolism : Mepolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is degraded by the proteolytic enzymes widely distributed in the body and not restricted to hepatic tissue .
Specific Populations Racial Groups and Male and Female Patients : Population pharmacokinetics analyses indicated there was no significant effect of race and gender on mepolizumab clearance .
Age : Population pharmacokinetics analyses indicated there was no significant effect of age on mepolizumab clearance .
Pediatric Patients : Mepolizumab pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous administration in subjects aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma was investigated in the initial 12 - week treatment phase of an open - label clinical trial .
Exposures ( AUC ) following subcutaneous administration of either 40 mg ( for children weighing < 40 kg ) or 100 mg ( for children weighing ≥ 40 kg ) were 1 . 32 and 1 . 97 times higher , respectively , compared with that observed in adults and adolescents receiving 100 mg .
Based on these results , simulation of a 40 - mg subcutaneous dose every 4 weeks in children aged 6 to 11 years , irrespective of body weight , resulted in predicted exposures similar to that observed in adults and adolescents .
Patients with Renal Impairment : No clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab .
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses , mepolizumab clearance was comparable between subjects with creatinine clearance values between 50 and 80 mL / min and patients with normal renal function .
There are limited data available in subjects with creatinine clearance values < 50 mL / min ; however , mepolizumab is not cleared renally .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment : No clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab .
Since mepolizumab is degraded by widely distributed proteolytic enzymes , not restricted to hepatic tissue , changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect on the elimination of mepolizumab .
Drug Interaction Studies No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with mepolizumab .
In population pharmacokinetics analyses of Phase 3 studies , there was no evidence of an effect of commonly coadministered small molecule drugs on mepolizumab exposure .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of mepolizumab .
Published literature using animal models suggests that IL - 5 and eosinophils are part of an early inflammatory reaction at the site of tumorigenesis and can promote tumor rejection .
However , other reports indicate that eosinophil infiltration into tumors can promote tumor growth .
Therefore , the malignancy risk in humans from an antibody to IL - 5 such as mepolizumab is unknown .
Male and female fertility were unaffected based upon no adverse histopathological findings in the reproductive organs from cynomolgus monkeys receiving mepolizumab for 6 months at IV dosages up to 100 mg / kg once every 4 weeks ( approximately 20 times the MRHD of 300 mg on an AUC basis ) .
Mating and reproductive performance were unaffected in male and female CD - 1 mice receiving an analogous antibody , which inhibits the activity of murine IL - 5 , at an IV dosage of 50 mg / kg once per week .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Severe Asthma The asthma development program for NUCALA in patients aged 12 years and older included 3 double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled trials : 1 dose - ranging and exacerbation trial ( Trial 1 , NCT01000506 ) and 2 confirmatory trials ( Trial 2 , NCT01691521 and Trial 3 , NCT01691508 ) .
Mepolizumab was administered every 4 weeks in all 3 trials as add - on to background treatment .
All patients continued their background asthma therapy throughout the duration of the trials .
Dose - Ranging and Exacerbation Trial Trial 1 was a 52 - week dose - ranging and exacerbation - reduction trial in patients with severe asthma with a history of 2 or more exacerbations in the previous year despite regular use of high - dose ICS plus additional controller ( s ) with or without OCS .
Patients enrolled in this trial were required to have at least 1 of the following 4 pre - specified criteria in the previous 12 months : blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells / mcL , sputum eosinophil count ≥ 3 % , exhaled nitric oxide concentration ≥ 50 ppb , or deterioration of asthma control after ≤ 25 % reduction in regular maintenance ICS / OCS .
Three IV dosages of mepolizumab ( 75 , 250 , and 750 mg ) administered once every 4 weeks were evaluated compared with placebo .
Results from this trial and the pharmacodynamic study supported the evaluation of mepolizumab 75 mg IV and 100 mg subcutaneous in the subsequent trials [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
NUCALA is not indicated for IV use and should only be administered by the subcutaneous route .
Confirmatory Trials A total of 711 patients with severe asthma were studied in the 2 confirmatory trials ( Trials 2 and 3 ) .
In these 2 trials patients were required to have blood eosinophils of ≥ 150 cells / mcL at screening ( within 6 weeks of dosing ) or blood eosinophils of ≥ 300 cells / mcL within 12 months of enrollment .
The screening blood eosinophils of ≥ 150 cells / mcL criterion was derived from exploratory analyses of data from Trial 1 .
Trial 2 was a 32 - week placebo - and active - controlled trial in patients with severe asthma with a history of 2 or more exacerbations in the previous year despite regular use of high - dose ICS plus additional controller ( s ) with or without OCS .
Patients received mepolizumab 75 mg IV ( n = 191 ) , NUCALA 100 mg ( n = 194 ) , or placebo ( n = 191 ) once every 4 weeks for 32 weeks .
Trial 3 was a 24 - week OCS - reduction trial in patients with severe asthma who required daily OCS in addition to regular use of high - dose ICS plus additional controller ( s ) to maintain asthma control .
Patients in Trial 3 were not required to have a history of exacerbations in the previous year .
Patients received NUCALA 100 mg ( n = 69 ) or placebo ( n = 66 ) once every 4 weeks for 24 weeks .
The baseline mean OCS use was similar in the 2 treatment groups : 13 . 2 mg in the placebo group and 12 . 4 mg in the group receiving NUCALA 100 mg .
The demographics and baseline characteristics of these 3 trials are provided in Table 3 .

For patients on maintenance OCS , an exacerbation requiring OCS was defined as the use of oral / systemic corticosteroids at least double the existing dose for at least 3 days .
Compared with placebo , patients receiving NUCALA 100 mg or mepolizumab 75 mg IV experienced significantly fewer exacerbations .
Additionally , compared with placebo , there were fewer exacerbations requiring hospitalization and / or emergency department visits and exacerbations requiring only in - patient hospitalization with NUCALA 100 mg ( Table 4 ) .

Trial 1 data were explored to determine criteria that could identify patients likely to benefit from treatment with NUCALA .
The exploratory analysis suggested that baseline blood eosinophil count of ≥ 150 cells / mcL was a potential predictor of treatment benefit .
Exploratory analysis of Trial 2 data also suggested that baseline blood eosinophil count ( obtained within 6 weeks of initiation of dosing ) of ≥ 150 cells / mcL was a potential predictor of efficacy and showed a trend of greater exacerbation benefit with increasing blood eosinophil count .
In Trial 2 , patients enrolled solely on the basis of the historical blood eosinophil count of ≥ 300 cells / mcL in the previous 12 months , but who had a baseline blood eosinophil count < 150 cells / mcL , had virtually no exacerbation benefit following treatment with NUCALA 100 mg compared with placebo .
The Asthma Control Questionnaire - 5 ( ACQ - 5 ) was assessed in Trials 1 and 2 , and the St . George ’ s Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) was assessed in Trial 2 .
In Trial 1 , the ACQ - 5 responder rate ( defined as a decrease in score of 0 . 5 or more as threshold ) for the 75 - mg IV mepolizumab arm was 47 % compared with 50 % for placebo with an odds ratio ( OR ) of 1 . 1 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 7 , 1 . 7 ) .
In Trial 2 , the ACQ - 5 responder rate for the treatment arm for NUCALA 100 mg was 57 % compared with 45 % for placebo with an OR of 1 . 8 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 2 , 2 . 8 ) .
In Trial 2 , the SGRQ responder rate ( defined as a decrease in score of 4 or more as threshold ) for the treatment arm for NUCALA 100 mg was 71 % compared with 55 % for placebo with an OR of 2 . 1 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 3 , 3 . 2 ) .
Oral Corticosteroid Reduction Trial 3 evaluated the effect of NUCALA 100 mg on reducing the use of maintenance OCS .
Efficacy was assessed using an endpoint of the percent reduction of OCS dose during Weeks 20 to 24 compared with baseline dose , while maintaining asthma control .
Patients were classified according to their change in OCS use during the trial with the following categories : 90 % to 100 % decrease , 75 % to < 90 % decrease , 50 % to < 75 % decrease , > 0 % to < 50 % decrease , and no improvement ( i . e . , no change or any increase or lack of asthma control or withdrawal of treatment ) .
Compared with placebo , patients receiving NUCALA 100 mg achieved greater reductions in daily maintenance OCS dose , while maintaining asthma control .
Sixteen ( 23 % ) patients in the group receiving NUCALA 100 mg versus 7 ( 11 % ) in the placebo group had a 90 % to 100 % reduction in their OCS dose .
Twenty - five ( 36 % ) patients in the group receiving NUCALA 100 mg versus 37 ( 56 % ) in the placebo group were classified as having no improvement for OCS dose .
Additionally , 54 % of patients receiving NUCALA 100 mg achieved at least a 50 % reduction in the daily prednisone dose compared with 33 % of patients receiving placebo ( 95 % CI for difference : 4 % , 37 % ) .
An exploratory analysis was also performed on the subgroup of 29 patients in Trial 3 who had an average baseline and screening blood eosinophil count < 150 cells / mcL .
Five ( 29 % ) patients in the group receiving NUCALA 100 mg versus 0 ( 0 % ) in the placebo group had a 90 % to 100 % reduction in their dose .
Four ( 24 % ) patients in the group receiving NUCALA 100 mg versus 8 ( 67 % ) in the placebo group were classified as having no improvement for OCS dose .
The ACQ and SGRQ were also assessed in Trial 3 and showed results similar to those in Trial 2 .
Lung Function Change from baseline in mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) was measured in all 3 trials and is presented in Table 5 .
Compared with placebo , NUCALA 100 mg did not provide consistent improvements in mean change from baseline in FEV1 .

Enrollment was not dependent on a history of exacerbations or a pre - specified eosinophil count .
Change from baseline in FEV1 at Week 12 was numerically lower in the mepolizumab treatment groups than the placebo group .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps A total of 407 adult patients with CRSwNP were evaluated in a randomized , double ‑ blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter , 52 - week trial ( NCT03085797 ) .
Patients received NUCALA 100 mg or placebo administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks while continuing nasal corticosteroid therapy .
Patients must have received background nasal corticosteroid for ≥ 8 weeks pre ‑ screening .
Patients had recurrent and symptomatic CRSwNP , and had at least 1 surgery for the removal of nasal polyps within the previous 10 years .
Patients were required to have nasal obstruction symptoms with a visual analog scale ( VAS ) score of > 5 out of a maximum score of 10 .
Patients were also required to have an endoscopic bilateral nasal polyp score ( NPS ) of ≥ 5 out of 8 with NPS ≥ 2 in each nasal cavity .
Patients reported nasal obstruction VAS scores daily by placing a single mark on a continuous line labeled from 0 ( none ) to 100 ( as bad as you can imagine ) .
The distance along the line was converted to a 0 to 10 point scale for scoring .
For NPS , polyps on each side of the nose were graded on a categorical scale ( 0 = no polyps , 1 = small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the inferior border of the middle concha , 2 = polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate , 3 = large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle concha , 4 = large polyps causing almost complete congestion / obstruction of the inferior meatus ) for a total score of 0 to 8 .
Sinus CT scans were not performed at baseline nor during treatment to evaluate for sinus opacification .
The co - primary endpoints were change from baseline to Week 52 in total endoscopic NPS ( 0 to 8 scale ) as graded by independent blinded assessors and change from baseline in nasal obstruction VAS score ( 0 to 10 scale ) during Weeks 49 to 52 .
The key secondary endpoint was the time to first nasal surgery ( nasal polypectomy ) up to Week 52 in this trial .
Other secondary endpoints were change from baseline in loss of smell VAS score during Weeks 49 to 52 , and proportion of patients requiring systemic steroids for nasal polyps up to Week 52 .
All VAS scores were collected daily by the patients and reported on a 0 to 10 scale ( 0 = none , 10 = as bad as you can imagine ) .
The demographics and baseline characteristics of patients in this trial are provided in Table 6 .

Additionally , based on a post - hoc analysis in these patients , there was a greater response from baseline at Week 52 in asthma control as measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ ‑ 5 ) for NUCALA 100 mg compared with placebo ( 57 % of the NUCALA patients met the responder threshold reduction of ≥ 0 . 5 , compared to 35 % in the placebo group , with an odds ratio of 2 . 42 ( 95 % CI 1 . 43 , 4 . 11 ) ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis A total of 136 adult patients with EGPA were evaluated in a randomized , placebo - controlled , multicenter , 52 - week trial ( NCT02020889 ) .
Patients received 300 mg of NUCALA or placebo administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks while continuing their stable OCS therapy .
Starting at Week 4 , OCS was tapered during the treatment period at the discretion of the investigator .
Efficacy was assessed in this trial using co - endpoints of the total accrued duration of remission over the 52 - week treatment period , defined as Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score ( BVAS ) = 0 ( no active vasculitis ) plus prednisolone or prednisone dose less than or equal to 4 mg / day , and the proportion of patients in remission at both Week 36 and Week 48 of treatment .
The BVAS is a clinician - completed tool to assess clinically active vasculitis that would likely require treatment , after exclusion of other causes .
The demographics and baseline characteristics of patients in this trial are provided in Table 9 .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 4 Hypereosinophilic Syndrome A total of 108 adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older with HES for at least 6 months were evaluated in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter , 32 - week trial ( NCT02836496 ) .
Patients with non ‑ hematologic secondary HES ( e . g . , drug hypersensitivity , parasitic helminth infection , HIV infection , non - hematologic malignancy ) or FIP1L1 - PDGFRα kinase - positive HES were excluded from the trial .
Patients received 300 mg of NUCALA or placebo subcutaneously once every 4 weeks while continuing their stable HES therapy .
Patients entering the trial had experienced at least 2 HES flares within the past 12 months and a blood eosinophil count of 1 , 000 cells / mcL or higher during screening .
Historical HES flares for the trial entry criteria were defined as HES - related worsening of clinical symptoms or blood eosinophil counts requiring an escalation in therapy .
Patients must have been on stable HES therapy for the 4 weeks prior to randomization .
HES therapy could include chronic or episodic oral corticosteroids ( OCS ) , immunosuppressive , or cytotoxic therapy .
The efficacy of NUCALA in HES was established based upon the proportion of patients who experienced a HES flare during the 32 - week treatment period .
A HES flare was defined as worsening of clinical signs and symptoms of HES or increasing eosinophils ( on at least 2 occasions ) , resulting in the need to increase OCS or increase / add cytotoxic or immunosuppressive HES therapy .
