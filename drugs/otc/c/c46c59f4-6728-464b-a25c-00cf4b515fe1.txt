For Intramuscular or Intravenous Injection To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Oxacillin for Injection , USP and other antibacterial drugs , Oxacillin for Injection , USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria .
DESCRIPTION Oxacillin for Injection , USP is a semisynthetic penicillin antibiotic derived from 6 - amino - penicillanic acid .
It is the sodium salt in a parenteral dosage form .
Each vial of Oxacillin for Injection , USP contains oxacillin sodium monohydrate equivalent to 1 gram or 2 grams of oxacillin .
The sodium content is 57 . 30 mg [ 2 . 5 mEq ] per gram oxacillin .
The product is buffered with 20 mg sterile disodium hydrogen phosphate per gram oxacillin .
Oxacillin for Injection , USP is a sterile , white to off - white powder supplied in vials .
Oxacillin sodium , C19H18N3NaO5S • H2O molecular weight 441 . 43 , is designated as 4 - Thia - 1 - azabicyclo [ 3 . 2 . 0 ] heptane - 2 - carboxylic acid , 3 , 3 - dimethyl - 6 - [ [ ( 5 - methyl - 3 - phenyl - 4 - isoxazolyl ) carbonyl ] amino ] - 7 - oxo - , monosodium salt , monohydrate , [ 2 S ( 2α , 5α , 6β ) ] and has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Intravenous administration provides peak serum levels approximately 5 minutes after the injection is completed .
Slow I . V . administration of 500 mg gives a peak serum level of 43 mcg / mL after 5 minutes with a half - life of 20 to 30 minutes .
Oxacillin sodium , with normal doses , has insignificant concentrations in the cerebrospinal and ascitic fluids .
It is found in therapeutic concentrations in the pleural , bile , and amniotic fluids .
Oxacillin Sodium is rapidly excreted as unchanged drug in the urine by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion .
The elimination half - life for oxacillin is about 0 . 5 hours .
Nonrenal elimination includes hepatic inactivation and excretion in bile .
Oxacillin sodium binds to serum protein , mainly albumin .
The degree of protein binding reported varies with the method of study and the investigator , but generally has been found to be 94 . 2 ± 2 . 1 % .
Probenecid blocks the renal tubular secretion of penicillins .
Therefore , the concurrent administration of probenecid prolongs the elimination of oxacillin and , consequently , increases the serum concentration .
Intramuscular injections give peak serum levels 30 minutes after injection .
A 250 mg dose gives a level of 5 . 3 mcg / mL while a 500 mg dose peaks at 10 . 9 mcg / mL .
Intravenous injection gives a peak about 5 minutes after the injection is completed .
Slow I . V . dosing with 500 mg gives a 5 minute peak of 43 mcg / mL with a half - life of 20 to 30 minutes .
Microbiology Mode of Action Penicillinase - resistant penicillins exert a bactericidal action against penicillin susceptible microorganisms during the state of active multiplication .
All penicillins inhibit the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall .
Mechanism of Resistance Resistance to penicillins may be mediated by destruction of the beta - lactam ring by a beta - lactamase , altered affinity of penicillin for target , or decreased penetration of the antibiotic to reach the target site .
Cross Resistance Resistance to oxacillin ( or cefoxitin ) implies resistance to all other beta - lactam agents , except newer agents with activity against methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug , please see : https : / / www . fda . gov / STIC .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Oxacillin is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by penicillinase producing staphylococci which have demonstrated susceptibility to the drug .
Cultures and susceptibility tests should be performed initially to determine the causative organism and its susceptibility to the drug ( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Susceptibility Test Methods ) .
Oxacillin may be used to initiate therapy in suspected cases of resistant staphylococcal infections prior to the availability of susceptibility test results .
Oxacillin should not be used in infections caused by organisms susceptible to penicillin G .
If the susceptibility tests indicate that the infection is due to an organism other than a resistant Staphylococcus , therapy should not be continued with oxacillin .
To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Oxacillin for Injection , USP and other antibacterial drugs , Oxacillin for Injection , USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
CONTRAINDICATIONS A history of a hypersensitivity ( anaphylactic ) reaction to any penicillin is a contraindication .
WARNINGS Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity ( anaphylactic shock with collapse ) reactions have occurred in patients receiving penicillin .
The incidence of anaphylactic shock in all penicillin - treated patients is between 0 . 015 and 0 . 04 percent .
Anaphylactic shock resulting in death has occurred in approximately 0 . 002 percent of the patients treated .
When oxacillin therapy is indicated , it should be initiated only after a comprehensive patient drug and allergy history has been obtained .
If an allergic reaction occurs , oxacillin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including Oxacillin for Injection , USP , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
PRECAUTIONS General Oxacillin should generally not be administered to patients with a history of sensitivity to any penicillin .
Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and / or asthma .
Whenever allergic reactions occur , penicillin should be withdrawn unless , in the opinion of the physician , the condition being treated is life - threatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy .
The use of antibiotics may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms .
If new infections due to bacteria or fungi occur , the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken .
Prescribing Oxacillin for Injection , USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
Laboratory Tests Bacteriologic studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to oxacillin should be performed ( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Microbiology ) .
In the treatment of suspected staphylococcal infections , therapy should be changed to another active agent if culture tests fail to demonstrate the presence of staphylococci .
Periodic assessment of organ system function including renal , hepatic , and hematopoietic should be made during prolonged therapy with oxacillin .
Blood cultures , white blood cell , and differential cell counts should be obtained prior to initiation of therapy and at least weekly during therapy with oxacillin .
Periodic urinalysis , blood urea nitrogen , and creatinine determinations should be performed during therapy with oxacillin and dosage alterations should be considered if these values become elevated .
If any impairment of renal function is suspected or known to exist , a reduction in the total dosage should be considered and blood levels monitored to avoid possible neurotoxic reactions .
AST ( SGOT ) and ALT ( SGPT ) values should be obtained periodically during therapy to monitor for possible liver function abnormalities .
Drug Interactions Tetracycline , a bacteriostatic antibiotic , may antagonize the bactericidal effect of penicillin and concurrent use of these drugs should be avoided .
Oxacillin blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of probenecid which blocks the renal tubular secretion of penicillins .
Probenecid decreases the apparent volume of distribution and slows the rate of excretion by competitively inhibiting renal tubular secretion of penicillins .
Oxacillin - probenecid therapy should be limited to those infections where very high serum levels of oxacillin are necessary .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term animal studies have been conducted with these drugs .
Studies on reproduction ( nafcillin ) in rats and rabbits reveal no fetal or maternal abnormalities before conception and continuously through weaning ( one generation ) .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Reproduction studies performed in the mouse , rat , and rabbit have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to the penicillinase - resistant penicillins .
Human experience with the penicillins during pregnancy has not shown any positive evidence of adverse effects on the fetus .
There are , however , no adequate or well - controlled studies in pregnant women showing conclusively that harmful effects of these drugs on the fetus can be excluded .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers Penicillins are excreted in human milk .
Caution should be exercised when penicillins are administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use Because of incompletely developed renal function in pediatric patients , oxacillin may not be completely excreted , with abnormally high blood levels resulting .
Frequent blood levels are advisable in this group with dosage adjustments when necessary .
All pediatric patients treated with penicillins should be monitored closely for clinical and laboratory evidence of toxic or adverse effects .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Oxacillin for Injection did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
Oxacillin for Injection contains 57 . 30 mg ( 2 . 5 mEq ) of sodium per gram .
At the usual recommended doses , patients would receive between 57 . 30 and 343 . 8 mg / day ( 2 . 5 and 15 mEq ) of sodium .
The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading .
This may be clinically important with regard to such diseases as congestive heart failure .
Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Oxacillin for Injection , USP should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When Oxacillin for Injection , USP is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may : ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment , and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Oxacillin for Injection , USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued .
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics , patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic .
If this occurs , patients should contact their physician as soon as possible .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Body as a Whole The reported incidence of allergic reactions to penicillin ranges from 0 . 7 to 10 percent ( see WARNINGS ) .
Sensitization is usually the result of treatment but some individuals have had immediate reactions when first treated .
In such cases , it is thought that the patients may have had prior exposure to the drug via trace amounts present in milk and vaccines .
Two types of allergic reactions to penicillins are noted clinically , immediate and delayed .
Immediate reactions usually occur within 20 minutes of administration and range in severity from urticaria and pruritus to angioneurotic edema , laryngospasm , bronchospasm , hypotension , vascular collapse and death .
Such immediate anaphylactic reactions are very rare ( see WARNINGS ) and usually occur after parenteral therapy but have occurred in patients receiving oral therapy .
Another type of immediate reaction , an accelerated reaction , may occur between 20 minutes and 48 hours after administration and may include urticaria , pruritus , and fever .
Although laryngeal edema , laryngospasm , and hypotension occasionally occur , fatality is uncommon .
Delayed allergic reactions to penicillin therapy usually occur after 48 hours and sometimes as late as 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy .
Manifestations of this type of reaction include serum sickness - like symptoms ( i . e . , fever , malaise , urticaria , myalgia , arthralgia , abdominal pain ) and various skin rashes .
Nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , stomatitis , black or hairy tongue , and other symptoms of gastrointestinal irritation may occur , especially during oral penicillin therapy .
Nervous System Reactions Neurotoxic reactions similar to those observed with penicillin G may occur with large intravenous doses of oxacillin , especially with patients with renal insufficiency .
Urogenital Reactions Renal tubular damage and interstitial nephritis have been associated with the administration of oxacillin .
Manifestations of this reaction may include rash , fever , eosinophilia , hematuria , proteinuria , and renal insufficiency .
Nephropathy induced by penicillins does not appear to be dose - related and is generally reversible upon prompt discontinuation of therapy .
Gastrointestinal Reactions Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with the use of oxacillin .
The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment ( see WARNINGS ) .
Metabolic Reactions Agranulocytosis , neutropenia , and bone marrow depression have been associated with the use of oxacillin .
Hepatotoxicity , characterized by fever , nausea , and vomiting associated with abnormal liver function tests , mainly elevated SGOT levels , has been associated with the use of oxacillin .

OVERDOSAGE The signs and symptoms of oxacillin overdosage are those described in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section .
If signs or symptoms occur , discontinue use of the medication , treat symptomatically , and institute appropriate supportive measures .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Bacteriologic studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to oxacillin should always be performed .
Duration of therapy varies with the type of severity of infection as well as the overall condition of the patient ; therefore , it should be determined by the clinical and bacteriological response of the patient .
In severe staphylococcal infections , therapy with oxacillin should be continued for at least 14 days .
Therapy should be continued for at least 48 hours after the patient has become afebrile , asymptomatic , and cultures are negative .
Treatment of endocarditis and osteomyelitis may require a longer duration of therapy .
With intravenous administration , particularly in elderly patients , care should be taken because of the possibility of thrombophlebitis .
