6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1 % of patients included worsening of conjunctivitis , eye irritation , dysgeusia , and eye pain .
( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Allergan at 1 - 800 - 433 - 8871 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In clinical studies with ZYMAXID ® , the most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1 % of patients in the gatifloxacin study population ( N = 717 ) were : worsening of the conjunctivitis , eye irritation , dysgeusia , and eye pain .
Additional adverse events reported with other formulations of gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution include chemosis , conjunctival hemorrhage , dry eye , eye discharge , eyelid edema , headache , increased lacrimation , keratitis , papillary conjunctivitis , and reduced visual acuity .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ZYMAXID ® ophthalmic solution .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Teratogenic Effects : There were no teratogenic effects observed in rats or rabbits following oral gatifloxacin doses up to 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1000 - fold higher than the maximum recommended ophthalmic dose ) .
However , skeletal / craniofacial malformations or delayed ossification , atrial enlargement , and reduced fetal weight were observed in fetuses from rats given ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( approximately 3000 - fold higher than the maximum recommended ophthalmic dose ) .
In a perinatal / postnatal study , increased late post - implantation loss and neonatal / perinatal mortalities were observed at 200 mg / kg / day ( approximately 4000 - fold higher than the maximum recommended ophthalmic dose ) .
Because there are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women , ZYMAXID ® solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Gatifloxacin is excreted in the breast milk of rats .
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when ZYMAXID ® is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ZYMAXID ® in infants below one year of age have not been established .
ZYMAXID ® has been demonstrated in clinical trials to be safe and effective for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis in pediatric patients one year or older ( see CLINICAL STUDIES , 14 ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION ZYMAXID ® sterile ophthalmic solution is an 8 - methoxyfluoroquinolone anti - infective for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis .
Its chemical name is ( ± ) - 1 - Cyclopropyl - 6 - fluoro - 1 , 4 - dihydro - 8 - methoxy - 7 - ( 3 - methyl - 1 - piperazinyl ) - 4 - oxo - 3 - quinolinecarboxylic acid , sesquihydrate .
Its molecular formula is C19H22FN3O4 · 1 ½ H2O , and its molecular weight is 402 . 42 .
Its chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] ZYMAXID ® is a clear , pale yellow , sterile , preserved aqueous solution with an osmolality of 260 - 330 mOsm / kg and a pH of 5 . 1 - 5 . 7 .
ZYMAXID ® contains Active : gatifloxacin 0 . 5 % ( 5 mg / mL ) ; Inactives : benzalkonium chloride 0 . 005 % ; edetate disodium ; purified water ; and sodium chloride .
May contain hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide to adjust pH . [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Gatifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , 12 . 4 ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0 . 3 % or 0 . 5 % was administered to one eye of 6 healthy male subjects each in an escalated dosing regimen starting with a single 2 drop dose , then 2 drops 4 times daily for 7 days , and finally 2 drops 8 times daily for 3 days .
At all time points , serum gatifloxacin levels were below the lower limit of quantification ( 5 ng / mL ) in all subjects .
12 . 4 Microbiology Gatifloxacin is an 8 - methoxyfluoroquinolone with a 3 - methylpiperazinyl substituent at C7 .
The antibacterial action of gatifloxacin results from inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV .
DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication , transcription , and repair of bacterial DNA .
Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division .
The mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones including gatifloxacin is different from that of aminoglycoside , macrolide , and tetracycline antibiotics .
Therefore , gatifloxacin may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics and these antibiotics may be active against pathogens that are resistant to gatifloxacin .
There is no cross - resistance between gatifloxacin and the aforementioned classes of antibiotics .
Cross resistance has been observed between systemic gatifloxacin and some other fluoroquinolones .
Resistance to gatifloxacin in vitro develops via multiple - step mutations .
Resistance to gatifloxacin in vitro occurs at a general frequency of 1 x 10 - 7 to 10 - 10 .
Gatifloxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following organisms both microbiologically and clinically , in conjunctival infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE , Section 1 .
Aerobic Gram - Positive Bacteria : Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Streptococcus mitis group * Streptococcus oralis * Streptococcus pneumoniae Aerobic Gram - Negative Bacteria : Haemophilus influenzae * Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility There was no increase in neoplasms among B6C3F1 mice given gatifloxacin in the diet for 18 months at doses averaging 81 mg / kg / day in males and 90 mg / kg / day in females .
These doses are approximately 1600 - fold and 1800 - fold higher , respectively , than the maximum recommended ophthalmic dose of 0 . 05 mg / kg / day in a 50 kg human .
There was no increase in neoplasms among Fischer 344 rats given gatifloxacin in the diet for 2 years at doses averaging 47 mg / kg / day in males and 139 mg / kg / day in females ( 900 - and 2800 - fold higher , respectively , than the maximum recommended ophthalmic dose ) .
A statistically significant increase in the incidence of large granular lymphocyte ( LGL ) leukemia was seen in males treated with a high dose of approximately 2000 - fold higher than the maximum recommended ophthalmic dose .
Fischer 344 rats have a high spontaneous background rate of LGL leukemia and the incidence in high - dose males only slightly exceeded the historical control range established for this strain .
In genetic toxicity tests , gatifloxacin was positive in 1 of 5 strains used in bacterial reverse mutation assays : Salmonella strain TA102 .
Gatifloxacin was positive in in vitro mammalian cell mutation and chromosome aberration assays .
Gatifloxacin was positive in in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes but not human leukocytes .
Gatifloxacin was negative in in vivo micronucleus tests in mice , cytogenetics test in rats , and DNA repair test in rats .
The findings may be due to the inhibitory effects of high concentrations on eukaryotic type II DNA topoisomerase .
There were no adverse effects on fertility or reproduction in rats given gatifloxacin orally at doses up to 200 mg / kg / day ( approximately 4000 - fold higher than the maximum recommended ophthalmic dose for ZYMAXID ® ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES In two randomized , double - masked , multicenter clinical trials , where patients 1 - 89 years of age were dosed for 5 days , ZYMAXID ® solution was clinically superior to its vehicle on day 6 in patients with conjunctivitis and positive conjunctival cultures .
Clinical outcomes for the trials demonstrated clinical success ( resolution of conjunctival hyperaemia and conjunctival discharge ) of 58 % ( 193 / 333 ) for the gatifloxacin - treated groups versus 45 % ( 148 / 325 ) for the vehicle - treated groups .
Microbiological outcomes for the same clinical trials demonstrated a statistically superior eradication rate for causative pathogens of 90 % ( 301 / 333 ) for gatifloxacin versus 70 % ( 228 / 325 ) for vehicle .
Please note that microbiological eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcome in anti - infective trials .
