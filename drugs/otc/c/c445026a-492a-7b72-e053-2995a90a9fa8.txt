[ MULTIMEDIA ] Meets USP Dissolution Test 2 [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 1 .
Mode of Action Norethindrone tablets progestin - only oral contraceptives prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in approximately half of users , thickening the cervical mucus to inhibit sperm penetration , lowering the midcycle LH and FSH peaks , slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallopian tubes , and altering the endometrium .
2 .
Pharmacokinetics Serum progestin levels peak about two hours after oral administration , followed by rapid distribution and elimination .
By 24 hours after drug ingestion , serum levels are near baseline , making efficacy dependent upon rigid adherence to the dosing schedule .
There are large variations in serum levels among individual users .
Progestin - only administration results in lower steady - state serum progestin levels and a shorter elimination half - life than concomitant administration with estrogens .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1 .
Indications Progestin - only oral contraceptives are indicated for the prevention of pregnancy .
2 .
Efficacy If used perfectly , the first - year failure rate for progestin - only oral contraceptives is 0 . 5 % .
However , the typical failure rate is estimated to be closer to 5 % , due to late or omitted pills .
Table 1 lists the pregnancy rates for users of all major methods of contraception .

The Food and Drug Administration has declared the following brands of oral contraceptives to be safe and effective for emergency contraception : Ovral ® ( 1 dose is 2 white pills ) , Alesse ® ( 1 dose is 5 pink pills ) , Nordette ® or Levlen ® ( 1 dose is 2 light - orange pills ) , Lo / Ovral ® ( 1 dose is 4 white pills ) , Triphasil ® or Tri - Levlen ® ( 1 dose is 4 yellow pills ) .
[ 2 ] However , to maintain effective protection against pregnancy , another method of contraception must be used as soon as menstruation resumes , the frequency or duration of breastfeeds is reduced , bottle feeds are introduced , or the baby reaches six months of age .
[ 3 ] Among couples attempting to avoid pregnancy , the percentage who continue to use a method for one year .
[ 4 ] Among typical couples who initiate use of a method ( not necessarily for the first time ) , the percentage who experience an accidental pregnancy during the first year if they do not stop use for any other reason .
[ 5 ] Among couples who initiate use of a method ( not necessarily for the first time ) and who use it perfectly ( both consistently and correctly ) , the percentage who experience an accidental pregnancy during the first year if they do not stop use for any other reason .
[ 6 ] The percents becoming pregnant in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are based on data from populations where contraception is not used and from women who cease using contraception in order to become pregnant .
Among such populations , about 89 % become pregnant within one year .
This estimate was lowered slightly ( to 85 % ) to represent the percent who would become pregnant within one year among women now relying on reversible methods of contraception if they abandoned contraception altogether .

Norethindrone tablets have not been studied for and are not indicated for use in emergency contraception .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Progestin - only oral contraceptives ( POPs ) should not be used by women who currently have the following conditions : • Known or suspected pregnancy • Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast • Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding • Hypersensitivity to any component of this product • Benign or malignant liver tumors • Acute liver disease WARNINGS Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular disease .
Women who use oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke .
Norethindrone tablets do not contain estrogen and , therefore , this insert does not discuss the serious health risks that have been associated with the estrogen component of combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) .
The healthcare professional is referred to the prescribing information of combined oral contraceptives for a discussion of those risks .
The relationship between progestin - only oral contraceptives and these risks is not fully defined .
The healthcare professional should remain alert to the earliest manifestation of symptoms of any serious disease and discontinue oral contraceptive therapy when appropriate .
1 .
Ectopic Pregnancy The incidence of ectopic pregnancies for progestin - only oral contraceptive users is 5 per 1000 woman - years .
Up to 10 % of pregnancies reported in clinical studies of progestin - only oral contraceptive users are extrauterine .
Although symptoms of ectopic pregnancy should be watched for , a history of ectopic pregnancy need not be considered a contraindication to use of this contraceptive method .
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy in women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain while on progestin - only oral contraceptives .
2 .
Delayed Follicular Atresia / Ovarian Cysts If follicular development occurs , atresia of the follicle is sometimes delayed and the follicle may continue to grow beyond the size it would attain in a normal cycle .
Generally these enlarged follicles disappear spontaneously .
Often they are asymptomatic ; in some cases they are associated with mild abdominal pain .
Rarely they may twist or rupture , requiring surgical intervention .
3 .
Irregular Genital Bleeding Irregular menstrual patterns are common among women using progestin - only oral contraceptives .
If genital bleeding is suggestive of infection , malignancy or other abnormal conditions , such nonpharmacologic causes should be ruled out .
If prolonged amenorrhea occurs , the possibility of pregnancy should be evaluated .
4 .
Carcinoma of the Breast and Reproductive Organs Some epidemiological studies of oral contraceptive users have reported an increased relative risk of developing breast cancer , particularly at a younger age and apparently related to duration of use .
These studies have predominantly involved combined oral contraceptives and there is insufficient data to determine whether the use of POPs similarly increases the risk .
A meta - analysis of 54 studies found a small increase in the frequency of having breast cancer diagnosed for women who were currently using combined oral contraceptives or had used them within the past ten years .
This increase in the frequency of breast cancer diagnosis , within ten years of stopping use , was generally accounted for by cancers localized to the breast .
There was no increase in the frequency of having breast cancer diagnosed ten or more years after cessation of use .
Women with breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because the role of female hormones in breast cancer has not been fully determined .
Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in some populations of women .
However , there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors .
There is insufficient data to determine whether the use of POPs increases the risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia .
5 .
Hepatic Neoplasia Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with combined oral contraceptive use , although the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States .
Rupture of benign , hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra - abdominal hemorrhage .
Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in combined oral contraceptive users .
However , these cancers are rare in the U . S .
There is insufficient data to determine whether POPs increase the risk of developing hepatic neoplasia .
PRECAUTIONS 1 .
General Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection ( AIDS ) and other sexually transmitted diseases .
2 .
Physical Examination and Follow - up It is considered good medical practice for sexually active women using oral contraceptives to have annual history and physical examinations .
The physical examination may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the healthcare professional .
3 .
Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism Some users may experience slight deterioration in glucose tolerance , with increases in plasma insulin but women with diabetes mellitus who use progestin - only oral contraceptives do not generally experience changes in their insulin requirements .
Nonetheless , prediabetic and diabetic women in particular should be carefully monitored while taking POPs .
Lipid metabolism is occasionally affected in that HDL , HDL 2 , and apolipoprotein A - I and A - II may be decreased ; hepatic lipase may be increased .
There is usually no effect on total cholesterol , HDL 3 , LDL , or VLDL .
4 .
Drug Interactions The effectiveness of progestin - only pills is reduced by hepatic enzyme - inducing drugs such as the anticonvulsants phenytoin , carbamazepine , and barbiturates , and the antituberculosis drug rifampin .
No significant interaction has been found with broad - spectrum antibiotics .
Herbal products containing St . John ' s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) may induce hepatic enzymes ( cytochrome P450 ) and p - glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids .
This may also result in breakthrough bleeding .
Concurrent use of bosentan and norethindrone containing products may result in decreased concentrations of these contraceptive hormones thereby increasing the risk of unintended pregnancy and unscheduled bleeding .
5 .
Interactions with Laboratory Tests The following endocrine tests may be affected by progestin - only oral contraceptive use : • Sex hormone - binding globulin ( SHBG ) concentrations may be decreased .
• Thyroxine concentrations may be decreased , due to a decrease in thyroid binding globulin ( TBG ) .
6 .
Carcinogenesis See WARNINGS .
7 .
Pregnancy Many studies have found no effects on fetal development associated with long - term use of contraceptive doses of oral progestins .
The few studies of infant growth and development that have been conducted have not demonstrated significant adverse effects .
It is nonetheless prudent to rule out suspected pregnancy before initiating any hormonal contraceptive use .
8 .
Nursing Mothers In general , no adverse effects have been found on breastfeeding performance or on the health , growth or development of the infant .
However , isolated post - marketing cases of decreased milk production have been reported .
Small amounts of progestins pass into the breast milk of nursing mothers , resulting in detectable steroid levels in infant plasma .
9 .
Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of norethindrone tablets have been established in women of reproductive age .
Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older .
Use of this product before menarche is not indicated .
10 .
Fertility Following Discontinuation The limited available data indicate a rapid return of normal ovulation and fertility following discontinuation of progestin - only oral contraceptives .
11 .
Headache The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of severe headache with focal neurological symptoms which is recurrent or persistent requires discontinuation of progestin - only contraceptives and evaluation of the cause .
INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT 1 .
See " Detailed Patient Labeling " for detailed information .
2 .
Counseling issues The following points should be discussed with prospective users before prescribing progestin - only oral contraceptives : • The necessity of taking pills at the same time every day , including throughout all bleeding episodes .
• The need to use a backup method such as a condom and spermicide for the next 48 hours whenever a progestin - only oral contraceptive is taken 3 or more hours late .
• The potential side effects of progestin - only oral contraceptives , particularly menstrual irregularities .
• The need to inform the healthcare professional of prolonged episodes of bleeding , amenorrhea or severe abdominal pain .
• The importance of using a barrier method in addition to progestin - only oral contraceptives if a woman is at risk of contracting or transmitting STDs / HIV .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions reported with the use of POPs include : • Menstrual irregularity is the most frequently reported side effect .
• Frequent and irregular bleeding are common , while long duration of bleeding episodes and amenorrhea are less likely .
• Headache , breast tenderness , nausea , and dizziness are increased among progestin - only oral contraceptive users in some studies .
• Androgenic side effects such as acne , hirsutism , and weight gain occur rarely .
The following adverse reactions were also reported in clinical trials or during post - marketing experience : Gastrointestinal Disorders : vomiting , abdominal pain ; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : fatigue , edema ; Psychiatric Disorders : depression , nervousness ; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : pain in extremity ; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders : genital discharge ; breast pain , menstruation delayed , suppressed lactation , vaginal hemorrhage , menorrhagia , withdrawal bleed when product is stopped ; Immune System Disorders : anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reaction , hypersensitivity ; Hepatobiliary Disorders : hepatitis , jaundice cholestatic ; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : alopecia , rash , rash pruritic .
OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdosage , including ingestion by children .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness , norethindrone tablets must be taken exactly as directed .
One tablet is taken every day , at the same time .
Administration is continuous , with no interruption between pill packs .

INTRODUCTION This leaflet is about birth control pills that contain one hormone , a progestin .
Please read this leaflet before you begin to take your pills .
It is meant to be used along with talking with your healthcare professional .
Progestin - only pills are often called " POPs " or " the minipill . "
POPs have less progestin than the combined birth control pill ( or " the pill " ) which contains both an estrogen and a progestin .
HOW EFFECTIVE ARE POPs ?
About 1 in 200 POP users will get pregnant in the first year if they all take POPs perfectly ( that is , on time , every day ) .
About 1 in 20 " typical " POP users ( including women who are late taking pills or miss pills ) gets pregnant in the first year of use .
Table 2 will help you compare the efficacy of different methods .
