6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of QULIPTA was evaluated in 1958 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of QULIPTA .
Of these , 839 patients were exposed to QULIPTA once daily for at least 6 months , and 487 patients were exposed for 12 months .
In the 12 - week , placebo - controlled clinical studies ( Study 1 and Study 2 ) , 314 patients received at least one dose of QULIPTA 10 mg once daily , 411 patients received at least one dose of QULIPTA 30 mg once daily , 417 patients received at least one dose of QULIPTA 60 mg once daily , and 408 patients received placebo [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Approximately 88 % were female , 80 % were White , 17 % were Black , and 12 % were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
The mean age at study entry was 41 years ( range 18 to 74 years ) .
The most common adverse reactions ( incidence at least 4 % and greater than placebo ) are nausea , constipation , and fatigue .
Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred during Study 1 and Study 2 .

Liver Enzyme Elevations In Study 1 and Study 2 , the rate of transaminase elevations over 3 times the upper limit of normal was similar between patients treated with QULIPTA ( 1 . 0 % ) and those treated with placebo ( 1 . 8 % ) .
However , there were cases with transaminase elevations over 3 times the upper limit of normal that were temporally associated with QULIPTA treatment ; these were asymptomatic , and resolved within 8 weeks of discontinuation .
There were no cases of severe liver injury or jaundice .
Decreases in Body Weight In Studies 1 and 2 , the proportion of patients with a weight decrease of at least 7 % at any point was 2 . 8 % for placebo , 3 . 8 % for QULIPTA 10 mg , 3 . 2 % for QULIPTA 30 mg , and 4 . 9 % for QULIPTA 60 mg .

( 2 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of QULIPTA with itraconazole , a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , resulted in a significant increase in exposure of atogepant in healthy subjects [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The recommended dosage of QULIPTA with concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , clarithromycin ) is 10 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment of QULIPTA is needed with concomitant use of moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors .
7 . 2CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of QULIPTA with steady state rifampin , a strong CYP3A4 inducer , resulted in a significant decrease in exposure of atogepant in healthy subjects [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Concomitant administration of QULIPTA with moderate inducers of CYP3A4 can also result in decreased exposure of atogepant .
The recommended dosage of QULIPTA with concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers ( e . g . , rifampin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , St . John ’ s wort , efavirenz , etravirine ) is 30 mg or 60 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment of QULIPTA is needed with concomitant use of weak CYP3A4 inducers .

The recommended dosage of QULIPTA with concomitant use of OATP inhibitors ( e . g . , cyclosporine ) is 10 mg or 30 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
( 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of QULIPTA in pregnant women .
In animal studies , oral administration of atogepant during the period of organogenesis ( rats and rabbits ) or throughout pregnancy and lactation ( rats ) resulted in adverse developmental effects ( decreased fetal and offspring body weight in rats ; increased incidence of fetal structural variations in rabbits ) at exposures greater than those used clinically [ see Data ] .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
The estimated rate of major birth defects ( 2 . 2 % - 2 . 9 % ) and miscarriage ( 17 % ) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo / Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy .
Data Animal Data Oral administration of atogepant ( 0 , 5 , 15 , 125 , or 750 mg / kg / day ) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreases in fetal body weight and in skeletal ossification at the two highest doses tested ( 125 and 750 mg / kg ) , which were not associated with maternal toxicity .
At the no - effect dose ( 15 mg / kg / day ) for adverse effects on embryofetal development , plasma exposure ( AUC ) was approximately 4 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 60 mg / day .
Oral administration of atogepant ( 0 , 30 , 90 , or 130 mg / kg / day ) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increase in fetal visceral and skeletal variations at the highest dose tested ( 130 mg / kg / day ) , which was associated with minimal maternal toxicity .
At the no - effect dose ( 90 mg / kg / day ) for adverse effects on embryofetal development , plasma exposure ( AUC ) was approximately 3 times that in humans at the MRHD .
Oral administration of atogepant ( 0 , 15 , 45 , or 125 mg / kg / day ) to rats throughout gestation and lactation resulted in decreased pup body weight at the highest dose tested ( 125 mg / kg / day ) , which persisted into adulthood .
At the no - effect dose ( 45 mg / kg / day ) for adverse effects on pre - and postnatal development , plasma exposure ( AUC ) was approximately 5 times that in humans at the MRHD .
8 . 2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of atogepant in human milk , the effects of atogepant on the breastfed infant , or the effects of atogepant on milk production .
In lactating rats , oral dosing with atogepant resulted in levels of atogepant in milk approximately 2 - fold higher than that in maternal plasma .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for QULIPTA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from QULIPTA or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Population pharmacokinetic modeling suggests no clinically significant pharmacokinetic differences between elderly and younger subjects .
Clinical studies of QULIPTA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The renal route of elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of atogepant [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr 15 - 29 mL / min ) , and in patients with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) ( CLcr < 15 mL / min ) , the recommended dosage of QULIPTA is 10 mg once daily .
For patients with ESRD undergoing intermittent dialysis , QULIPTA should preferably be taken after dialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment of QULIPTA is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment .
Avoid use of QULIPTA in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient of QULIPTA is atogepant , a calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) receptor antagonist .
The chemical name of atogepant is ( 3 ' S ) - N - [ ( 3 S , 5 S , 6 R ) - 6 - methyl - 2 - oxo - 1 - ( 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethyl ) - 5 - ( 2 , 3 , 6 - trifluorophenyl ) piperidin - 3 - yl ] - 2 ' - oxo - 1 ' , 2 ' , 5 , 7 - tetrahydrospiro [ cyclopenta [ b ] pyridine - 6 , 3 ' - pyrrolo [ 2 , 3 - b ] pyridine ] - 3 - carboxamide , and it has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular formula is C29H23F6N5O3 and molecular weight is 603 . 5 .
Atogepant is a white to off - white powder .
It is freely soluble in ethanol , soluble in methanol , sparingly soluble in acetone , slightly soluble in acetonitrile , and practically insoluble in water .
QULIPTA is available as tablets for oral administration containing 10 mg , 30 mg , or 60 mg atogepant .
The inactive ingredients include colloidal silicon dioxide , croscarmellose sodium , mannitol , microcrystalline cellulose , polyvinylpyrrolidone vinyl acetate copolymer , sodium chloride , sodium stearyl fumarate , and vitamin E polyethylene glycol succinate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Atogepant is a calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) receptor antagonist .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum recommended daily dose , QULIPTA does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of QULIPTA , atogepant is absorbed with peak plasma concentrations at approximately 1 to 2 hours .
Following once daily dosing , atogepant displays dose - proportional pharmacokinetics up to 170 mg ( approximately 3 times the highest recommended dosage ) , with no accumulation .
Effect of Food When QULIPTA was administered with a high - fat meal , the food effect was not significant ( AUC and Cmax were reduced by approximately 18 % and 22 % , respectively , with no effect on median time to maximum atogepant plasma concentration ) .
QULIPTA was administered without regard to food in clinical efficacy studies .
Distribution Plasma protein binding of atogepant was not concentration - dependent in the range of 0 . 1 to 10 µM ; the unbound fraction of atogepant was approximately 4 . 7 % in human plasma .
The mean apparent volume of distribution of atogepant ( Vz / F ) after oral administration is approximately 292 L . Elimination Metabolism Atogepant is eliminated mainly through metabolism , primarily by CYP3A4 .
The parent compound ( atogepant ) , and a glucuronide conjugate metabolite ( M23 ) were the most prevalent circulating components in human plasma .
Excretion The elimination half - life of atogepant is approximately 11 hours .
The mean apparent oral clearance ( CL / F ) of atogepant is approximately 19 L / hr .
Following single oral dose of 50 mg 14 C - atogepant to healthy male subjects , 42 % and 5 % of the dose was recovered as unchanged atogepant in feces and urine , respectively .
Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The renal route of elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of atogepant .
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis , there is no significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of atogepant in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 - 89 mL / min ) relative to those with normal renal function ( CLcr > 90 mL / min ) .
As patients with severe renal impairment or end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ; CLcr < 30 mL / min ) have not been studied , use of the lowest effective dosage of atogepant ( 10 mg ) is recommended in those patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with pre - existing mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) , moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) , or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) , the total atogepant exposure was increased by 24 % , 15 % , and 38 % , respectively .
Due to a potential for liver injury in patients with severe hepatic impairment , avoid use of QULIPTA in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Other Specific Populations Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis , age , sex , race , and body weight did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics ( Cmax and AUC ) of atogepant .
Therefore , no dose adjustments are warranted based on these factors .
Drug Interactions In Vitro Studies Enzymes In vitro , atogepant is not an inhibitor for CYPs 3A4 , 1A2 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , or 2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations .
Atogepant does not inhibit MAO - A or UGT1A1 at clinically relevant concentrations .
Atogepant is not anticipated to be a clinically significant perpetrator of drug - drug interactions through CYP450s , MAO - A , or UGT1A1 inhibition .
Atogepant is not an inducer of CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , or CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations .
Transporters Atogepant is a substrate of P - gp , BCRP , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , and OAT1 .
Dose adjustment for concomitant use of QULIPTA with inhibitors of OATP is recommended based on a clinical interaction study with a OATP inhibitor [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Coadministration of atogepant with BCRP and / or P - gp inhibitors is not expected to increase the exposure of atogepant .
Atogepant is not a substrate of OAT3 , OCT2 , or MATE1 .
Atogepant is not an inhibitor of P - gp , BCRP , OAT1 , OAT3 , NTCP , BSEP , MRP3 , or MRP4 at clinically relevant concentrations .
Atogepant is a weak inhibitor of OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OCT1 , and MATE1 .
No clinical drug interactions are expected for atogepant as a perpetrator with these transporters .
In Vivo Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors Co - administration of QULIPTA with itraconazole , a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , resulted in a clinically significant increase ( Cmax by 2 . 15 - fold and AUC by 5 . 5 - fold ) in the exposure of atogepant in healthy subjects [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) modeling suggested co - administration of QULIPTA with moderate ( e . g . , cyclosporine , ciprofloxacin , fluconazole , fluvoxamine , grapefruit juice ) or weak ( e . g . , cimetidine , esomeprazole ) CYP3A4 inhibitors increase atogepant AUC by 1 . 7 - and 1 . 1 - fold , respectively .
The changes in atogepant exposure when coadministered with weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are not expected to be clinically significant .
CYP3A4 Inducers Co - administration of QULIPTA with rifampin , a strong CYP3A4 inducer , decreased atogepant AUC by 60 % and Cmax by 30 % in healthy subjects [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
No dedicated drug interaction studies were conducted to assess concomitant use with moderate or weak CYP3A4 inducers .
Moderate inducers of CYP3A4 can decrease atogepant exposure [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Clinically significant interaction is not expected with concomitant administration of weak inducers of CYP3A4 and QULIPTA .
BCRP / OATP / P - gp Inhibitors Co - administration of QULIPTA with single dose rifampin , an OATP inhibitor , increased atogepant AUC by 2 . 85 - fold and Cmax by 2 . 23 - fold in healthy subjects [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Co - administration of QULIPTA with quinidine , a P - gp inhibitor , increased atogepant AUC by 26 % and Cmax by 4 % in healthy subjects .
The changes in atogepant exposure when co - administered with P - gp inhibitors are not expected to be clinically significant .
PBPK modeling suggests that co - administration of QULIPTA with BCRP inhibitors increases atogepant exposure by 1 . 2 - fold .
This increase is not expected to be clinically significant .
Other Drug Interaction Evaluations Co - administration of QULIPTA with oral contraceptive components ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel , famotidine , esomeprazole , acetaminophen , naproxen , or sumatriptan did not result in significant pharmacokinetic interactions for either atogepant or co - administered drugs .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Atogepant was administered orally to mice ( 0 , 5 , 20 , or 75 mg / kg / day in males ; 0 , 5 , 30 , 160 mg / kg / day in females ) and rats ( 0 , 10 , 20 , or 100 mg / kg in males ; 0 , 25 , 65 , or 200 mg / kg in females ) for up to 2 years .
There was no evidence of drug - related tumors in either species .
Plasma exposures at the highest doses tested in mice and rats were approximately 8 and 20 - 35 times , respectively , that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 60 mg / day .
Mutagenicity Atogepant was negative in in vitro ( Ames , chromosomal aberration test in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells ) and in vivo ( rat bone marrow micronucleus ) assays .
Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of atogepant ( 0 , 5 , 20 , or 125 mg / kg / day ) to male and female rats prior to and during mating and continuing in females to Gestation Day 7 resulted in no adverse effects on fertility or reproductive performance .
Plasma exposures ( AUC ) at the highest dose tested are approximately 15 times that in humans at the MRHD .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of QULIPTA for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults was demonstrated in two randomized , multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies ( Study 1 and Study 2 ) .
The studies enrolled patients with at least a 1 - year history of migraine with or without aura , according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders ( ICHD - 3 ) diagnostic criteria .
In Study 1 ( NCT03777059 ) , 910 patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 to receive QULIPTA 10 mg ( N = 222 ) , QULIPTA 30 mg ( N = 230 ) , QULIPTA 60 mg ( N = 235 ) , or placebo ( N = 223 ) , once daily for 12 weeks .
In Study 2 ( NCT02848326 ) , 652 patients were randomized 1 : 2 : 2 : 2 to receive QULIPTA 10 mg ( N = 94 ) , QULIPTA 30 mg ( N = 185 ) , QULIPTA 60 mg ( N = 187 ) , or placebo ( N = 186 ) , once daily for 12 weeks .
In both studies , patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments ( i . e . , triptans , ergotamine derivatives , NSAIDs , acetaminophen , and opioids ) as needed .
The use of a concomitant medication that acts on the CGRP pathway was not permitted for either acute or preventive treatment of migraine .
The studies excluded patients with myocardial infarction , stroke , or transient ischemic attacks within six months prior to screening .
Study 1 The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days ( MMD ) across the 12 - week treatment period .
Secondary endpoints included the change from baseline in mean monthly headache days , the change from baseline in mean monthly acute medication use days , the proportion of patients achieving at least a 50 % reduction from baseline in mean MMD ( 3 - month average ) , the change from baseline in mean monthly Activity Impairment in Migraine - Diary ( AIM - D ) Performance of Daily Activities ( PDA ) domain scores , the change from baseline in mean monthly AIM - D Physical Impairment ( PI ) domain scores , across the 12 - week treatment period , and the change from baseline at Week 12 for Migraine Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire version 2 . 1 ( MSQ v2 . 1 ) Role Function - Restrictive ( RFR ) domain scores .
The AIM - D evaluates difficulty with performance of daily activities ( PDA domain ) and physical impairment ( PI domain ) due to migraine , with scores ranging from 0 to 100 .
Higher scores indicate greater impact of migraine , and reductions from baseline indicate improvement .
The MSQ v2 . 1 Role Function - Restrictive ( RFR ) domain score assesses how often migraine impacts function related to daily social and work - related activities over the past 4 weeks , with scores ranging from 0 to 100 .
Higher scores indicate lesser impact of migraine on daily activities , and increases from baseline indicate improvement .
Patients had a mean age of 42 years ( range 18 to 73 years ) , 89 % were female , 83 % were White , 14 % were Black , and 9 % were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
The mean migraine frequency at baseline was approximately 8 migraine days per month and was similar across treatment groups .
A total of 805 ( 88 % ) patients completed the 12 - week double - blind study period .
Key efficacy results of Study 1 are summarized in Table 3 .
