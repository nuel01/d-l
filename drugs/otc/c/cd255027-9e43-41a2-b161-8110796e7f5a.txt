8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel use in pregnant women to evaluate a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
The limited published data on use of clindamycin in pregnant women with exposure during the first trimester are insufficient to inform a drug - associated risk of pregnancy - related adverse outcomes ( see Data ) .
In limited published clinical trials with pregnant women , the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters has not been associated with an increased frequency of major birth defects .
In animal reproduction studies , clindamycin did not cause malformations or embryo - fetal development toxicity in pregnant rats and mice when administered during the period of organogenesis at systemic doses up to 240 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 2 . 5 g clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , based on body surface area ( BSA ) comparisons ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of major birth defects , loss , and other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data In limited published trials in pregnant women administered clindamycin during the first trimester of pregnancy , there was no difference in the rate of major birth defects reported among in utero exposed infants compared to unexposed infants .
These data cannot definitely establish or exclude any clindamycin - associated risk during pregnancy .
Animal Data Animal reproductive / developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel or benzoyl peroxide .
Developmental toxicity studies of clindamycin performed in pregnant rats and mice administered during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of up to 600 mg / kg / day ( 240 and 120 times the MRHD for clindamycin , respectively , based on BSA comparisons ) or subcutaneous doses of up to 200 mg / kg / day ( 80 and 40 times the MRHD for clindamycin , respectively , based on BSA comparisons ) revealed no malformations or embryo - fetal development toxicity .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of clindamycin or benzoyl peroxide in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production following topical administration .
However , clindamycin has been reported to be present in breast milk in small amounts following oral and parenteral administration .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations If used during lactation and clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel is applied to the chest , care should be taken to avoid accidental ingestion by the infant .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel in pediatric patients under the age of 12 years have not been evaluated .

11 DESCRIPTION Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel is a combination product with two active ingredients in a white to off - white , opaque , smooth , aqueous gel formulation intended for topical use .
Clindamycin phosphate is a water - soluble ester of the semisynthetic antibiotic produced by a 7 ( S ) - chloro - substitution of the 7 ( R ) - hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin .
The chemical name for clindamycin phosphate is Methyl 7 - chloro - 6 , 7 , 8 - trideoxy - 6 - ( 1 - methyl - trans - 4 - propyl - L - 2 - pyrrolidinecarboxamido ) - 1 - thio - L - threo - α - D - galacto - octopyranoside 2 - ( dihydrogen phosphate ) .
The structural formula for clindamycin phosphate is represented below : Clindamycin phosphate : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Formula : C18H34ClN2O8 PS Molecular Weight : 504 . 97 Benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial and keratolytic agent .
The structural formula for benzoyl peroxide is represented below : Benzoyl peroxide : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Formula : C14H10O4 Molecular Weight : 242 . 23 Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel contains the following inactive ingredients : carbomer homopolymer type C , poloxamer 124 , potassium hydroxide , propylene glycol , and purified water .
Each gram of Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel contains 12 mg ( 1 . 2 % ) clindamycin phosphate , equivalent to 10 mg ( 1 % ) clindamycin , and 37 . 5 mg ( 3 . 75 % ) benzoyl peroxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Clindamycin : Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibacterial [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
Benzoyl Peroxide : Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects but the precise mechanism of action is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The systemic absorption of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel has not been evaluated .
The systemic absorption of clindamycin was investigated in an open - label , multiple - dose trial in 16 adult subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris treated with 1 gram of a marketed gel containing clindamycin 1 % / benzoyl peroxide 2 . 5 % applied to the face once daily for 30 days .
This product has the same formulation as clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel but with a lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide .
Twelve subjects ( 75 % ) had at least one quantifiable clindamycin plasma concentration above the lower limit of quantification ( LOQ = 0 . 5 ng / mL ) on Day 1 or Day 30 .
On Day 1 , the mean ( ± standard deviation ) peak plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) was 0 . 78 ± 0 . 22 ng / mL ( n = 9 with measurable concentrations ) , and the mean AUC0 - t was 5 . 29 ± 0 . 81 h ∙ ng / mL ( n = 4 ) .
On Day 30 , the mean Cmax was 1 . 22 ± 0 . 88 ng / mL ( n = 10 ) , and the mean AUC0 - t was 8 . 42 ± 6 . 01 h ∙ ng / mL ( n = 6 ) .
Clindamycin plasma concentrations were below LOQ in all subjects at 24 hours post - dose on the three tested days ( Day 1 , 15 , and 30 ) .
Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid .
12 . 4 Microbiology Clindamycin binds to the 50 S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer , thereby suppressing bacterial protein synthesis .
Clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide individually have been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes , an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris .
In an in vitro study , the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) for benzoyl peroxide against Propionibacterium acnes is 128 mg / L .
The clinical significance of this activity against P . acnes is not known .
P . acnes resistance to clindamycin has been documented .
Resistance to clindamycin is often associated with resistance to erythromycin .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity , mutagenicity , and impairment of fertility testing of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel have not been performed .
Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be a tumor promoter and progression agent in a number of animal studies .
Benzoyl peroxide in acetone at doses of 5 and 10 mg administered topically twice per week for 20 weeks induced skin tumors in transgenic Tg ∙ AC mice .
The clinical significance of this is unknown .
Carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with a gel formulation containing 1 % clindamycin and 5 % benzoyl peroxide .
In a 2 - year dermal carcinogenicity study in mice , treatment with the gel formulation at doses of 900 , 2700 , and 15000 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 8 , 5 . 4 , and 30 times the MRHD for clindamycin and 2 . 4 , 7 . 2 , and 40 times the MRHD for benzoyl peroxide , respectively , based on BSA comparisons ) did not cause any increase in tumors .
However , topical treatment with a different gel formulation containing 1 % clindamycin and 5 % benzoyl peroxide at doses of 100 , 500 , and 2000 mg / kg / day caused a dose - dependent increase in the incidence of keratoacanthoma at the treated skin site of male rats in a 2 - year dermal carcinogenicity study in rats .
In an oral ( gavage ) carcinogenicity study in rats , treatment with the gel formulation at doses of 300 , 900 , and 3000 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 2 , 3 . 6 , and 12 times the MRHD for clindamycin and 1 . 6 , 4 . 8 , and 16 times the MRHD for benzoyl peroxide , respectively , based on BSA comparisons ) for up to 97 weeks did not cause any increase in tumors .
Clindamycin phosphate was not genotoxic in the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay .
Benzoyl peroxide has been found to cause DNA strand breaks in a variety of mammalian cell types , to be mutagenic in S . typhimurium tests by some but not all investigators , and to cause sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells .
Fertility studies have not been performed with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel or benzoyl peroxide , but fertility and mating ability have been studied with clindamycin .
Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg / kg / day of clindamycin ( approximately 120 times the MRHD for clindamycin based on BSA comparisons ) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of once - daily use of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel was assessed in a 12 - week multi - center , randomized , blinded trial in subjects 12 years and older with moderate to severe acne vulgaris .
This trial evaluated clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel compared to vehicle gel .
The co - primary efficacy variables for this trial were : • ( 1 ) Mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in : • Inflammatory lesion counts • Non - inflammatory lesion counts • ( 2 ) Percent of subjects who had a 2 - grade reduction from baseline on an Evaluator ' s Global Severity ( EGS ) score .
The EGS scoring scale used in the clinical trial for clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel is as follows : Table 2 : EGS Scoring ScaleGrade Description Clear Normal , clear skin with no evidence of acne Almost Clear Rare non - inflammatory lesions present , with rare non - inflamed papules ( papules must be resolving and may be hyperpigmented , though not pink - red ) Mild Some non - inflammatory lesions are present , with few inflammatory lesions ( papules / pustules only ; no nodulocystic lesions ) Moderate Non - inflammatory lesions predominate , with multiple inflammatory lesions evident : several to many comedones and papules / pustules , and there may or may not be one small nodulocystic lesion Severe Inflammatory lesions are more apparent , many comedones and papules / pustules , there may or may not be up to 2 nodulocystic lesions Very Severe Highly inflammatory lesions predominate , variable number of comedones , many papules / pustules and more than 2 nodulocystic lesions The results of the trial at Week 12 are presented in Table 3 : Table 3 : Results of Phase 3 Trial at Week 12 Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel N = 253 Vehicle Gel N = 245 EGSS : Clear or Almost Clear 29 % 15 % 2 - grade reduction from baseline 35 % 17 % Inflammatory Lesions : Mean absolute reduction 16 . 3 8 . 2 Mean percent ( % ) reduction 60 . 4 % 31 . 3 % Non - Inflammatory Lesions : Mean absolute reduction 19 . 2 9 . 6 Mean percent ( % ) reduction 51 . 8 % 27 . 6 % 16 HOW SUPPLIED / STORAGE AND HANDLING 16 . 1 How Supplied Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 1 . 2 % / 3 . 75 % is a white to off - white smooth gel supplied as a 50 g pump ( NDC 51672 - 1403 - 4 ) 16 . 2 Dispensing Instructions for the Pharmacist • Dispense clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel with a 10 - week expiration date .
