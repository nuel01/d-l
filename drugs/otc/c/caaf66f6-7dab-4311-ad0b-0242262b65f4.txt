6 . 1 Clinical trials experience The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the labeling : • Hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Skin Irritation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates are observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In two multicenter , randomized , double - blind , vehicle - controlled trials ( Trial 1 and 2 ) , 832 subjects 9 years of age and older with facial acne vulgaris applied TWYNDO Cream ( N = 555 ) or vehicle ( N = 277 ) daily for 12 weeks .
The majority of subjects were White ( 73 % ) and female ( 59 % ) .
Approximately 33 % were Hispanic / Latino , and 46 % were younger than 18 years of age .
Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 1 . 0 % of subjects treated with TWYNEO Cream ( and for which the rate exceeded the rate for vehicle ) , as well as the corresponding rates reported in subjects treated with vehicle are presented in Table 1 .

Local tolerability scores for erythema , scaling , dryness , itching , burning and stinging rose during the first two weeks of treatment and decreased thereafter .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of benzoyl peroxide .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Immune System Disorders : Anaphylaxis , angioedema and uticaria 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published observational studies of topical tretinoin in pregnant women have not established a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Studies conducted with benzoyl peroxide have not demonstrated systemic absorption and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to benzoyl peroxide .
There are no data on TWYNEO Cream use in pregnant women .
There are reports of major birth defects reported with maternal use of topical tretinoin similar to those seen in infants exposed to oral retinoids , but those case reports do not establish a pattern or association with tretinoin - related embryopathy ( see Data ) .
Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with TWYNEO Cream or benzoyl peroxide .
Topical administration of tretinoin to pregnant rats during organogenesis was associated with malformations ( craniofacial abnormalities [ hydrocephaly ] , asymmetrical thyroids , variations in ossification , and increased supernumerary ribs ) at doses greater than 1 mg tretinoin / kg / day , approximately 5 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHC ) based on body surface area ( BSA ) comparison and assuming 100 % absorption .
Oral administration of tretinoin to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis was associated with malformations at 10 mg / kg / day ( approximately 100 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption ) ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of major birth defects , loss and other adverse outcomes .
The background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4 % of miscarriage is 15 to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Human Data While available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk , published data from multiple prospective controlled observational studies on the use of topical tretinoin products during pregnancy have not identified an association with topical tretinoin and major birth defects or miscarriage .
The available studies have methodologic limitations , including small sample size and in some cases , lack of physical exam by an expert in birth defects .
There are published case reports of infants exposed to topical tretinoin during the first trimester that describe major birth defects similar to those seen in infants exposed to oral retinoids ; however , no pattern of malformations has been identified and no causal association has been established in these cases .
The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known .
Animal Data For purposes of comparison of the animal exposure to human exposure , the MRHD is defined as 1 . 5 g of TWYNEO Cream ( containing 0 . 1 % tretinoin ) applied daily to a 60 - kg person ( 0 . 03 mg tretinoin / kg body weight ) .
Topical tretinoin embryofetal development studies have generated equivocal results .
There is evidence of malformations ( shortened or kinked tail ) after topical tretinoin administration in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg / kg / day ( approximately 5 times the MHRD based on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption ) .
Anomalies ( humerus : short 13 % , bent 6 % , or parietal incompletely ossified 14 % ) have also been reported when 10 mg / kg / day 9 approximately 50 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption ) was topically applied to pregnant rats during organogenesis .
Increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly , typical of retinoid - induced fetal malformations were noted in New Zealand White rabbits administered topical doses greater than 0 . 2 mg / kg / day ( 2 . 2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption ) .
Oral tretinoin induced malformations in rats , mice , hamsters , and nonhuman primates when administered during the period of organogenesis .
Fetal malformations were observed when tretinoin was orally administered to pregnant Wistar rats during organogenesis .
It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg / kg / day ( approximately 5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption ) .
In cynomolgus monkey , fetal malformations were reported when an oral dose of 10 mg / kg / day was administered to pregnant monkeys during organogenesis ( approximately 100 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption ) .
No fetal malformations were observed at an oral dose of 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 50 times the MRHD base on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption ) .
Increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses , and a dose - related increase in embryo lethality and abortion was reported in this study .
Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques .
Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered at a dose of 2 . 5 mg / kg / day ( 13 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption ) .
Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered at a dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( 5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
It is not known whether topical administration of tretinoin could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable concentrations in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for TWYNEO Cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from TWYNEO or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TWYNEO Cream for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in pediatric patients 9 years of age and older based on evidence from two multicenter , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group , vehicle - controlled , 12 - week clinical trials and an open - label pharmacokinetic study .
A total of 283 pediatric subjects 9 years of age and older received TWYNEO Cream in the clinical studies [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of TWYNEO Cream in pediatric patients below 9 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of TWYNEO Cream did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects .
11 DESCRIPTION TWYNEO ( tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide ) Cream is a yellow cream for topical use .
Each gram of TWYNEO Cream contains 1 mg ( 0 . 1 % ) of tretinoin and 30 mg ( 3 % ) of benzoyl peroxide .
Tretinoin is a retinoid and benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent .
The chemical name for tretinoin is all - trans - retinoic acid , also known as ( all - E ) - 3 , 7 - dimethyl - 9 - ( 2 , 6 , 6 - trimethyl - 1 - cyclohexen - 1 - yl ) - 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 - nonatetraenoic acid .
Tretinoin has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Formula : C20H28O2 Molecular Weight : 300 . 44 The chemical name for benzoyl peroxide is benzoyl benzenecarboperoxoate .
Benzoyl peroxide has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Formula : C14H10O4 Molecular Weight : 242 . 23 The formulation of TWYNEO Cream uses silica ( silicon dioxide ) core shell structures to separately micro - encapsulate tretinoin crystals and benzoyl peroxide crystals inclusion inclusion of the two active ingredients in the cream .
TWYNEO Cream contains the following inactive ingredients : anhydrous citric acid , butylated hydroxytoluene , carbomer homopolymer type C , cetrimonium chloride , cetyl alcohol , cyclomethicone , edetate disodium , glycerin , hydrochloric acid , imidurea , ( S ) lactic acid , macrogol stearate , mono and di - glycerides , polyquaternium - 7 , purified water , silicon dioxide , sodium hydroxide , squalane , tetraethyl ortho silicate and white wax .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects , but the precise mechanism of action is unknown .
Tretinoin is a metabolite of vitamin A that binds with high affinity to specific retinoic acid receptors located in both the cytosol and nucleus .
Tretinoin activates three members of the retinoic acid ( RAR ) nuclear receptors ( RARα , RARß , RARγ ) which act to modify gene expression , subsequent protein synthesis , and epithelial cell growth an differentiation .
It has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors , other mechanisms .
Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin in acne treatment is unknown , current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation .
Additionally , tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of TWYNEO Cream in the treatment of acne vulgaris are unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide was not assessed .
Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine .
Plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its major metabolites were evaluated in 35 subjects in an open - label , randomized , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study .
Subjects 9 years of age and older with acne vulgaris applied a mean dose of 1 . 9 g TWYNEO Cream to the skin of the face , shoulders , upper back and upper chest once daily for 14 days .
Steady - state PK characteristics were determined from samples drawn on Day 14 .
The mean baseline corrected Cmax and AUC0 - 24 of tretinoin and its metabolites after once daily application of TWYNEO Cream for 14 days are provided in Table 3 .
No detectable levels of the metabolites all - trans 4 - keto retinoic acid and 9 - cis retinoid acid were found in subjects treated with TWYNEO Cream .

Benzoyl peroxide The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species ; however the significance of this finding in humans is unknown .
No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rats treated topically with 15 to 25 % benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel ( 5 to 8 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in TWYNEO Cream ) for two years .
Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25 % benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15 % benzoyl peroxide gel for the rest of the two - year study period , and in mice treated topically with 5 % benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years .
Bacterial mutagenicity assays ( Ames test ) conducted with benzoyl peroxid have provided mixed results .
Mutagenic potential was observed in a few studies but not in a majority of investigations .
Benzoyl peroxide has been found to cause DNA strand breaks in a variety of mammalian cell types and to cause sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells .
Fertility studies were not conducted with benzoyl peroxide .
Tretinoin In a 91 - week dermal study , CD - 1 mice were administered 0 . 017 % and 0 . 035 % formulations of tretinoin , cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice .
A dose - related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses .
The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0 . 017 % and 0 . 035 % formulations are 0 . 5 and 1 . 0 mg / kg / day , respectively .
These doses are 1 . 3 and 2 . 7 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption .
The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose ( MTD ) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice .
There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0 . 025 mg / kg / day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice ( 0 . 07 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption ) .
The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in an in vitro bacterial reversion test and an in vivo rat micronucleus assay , both of which were negative .
In dermal fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats , slight ( not statistically significant ) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 . 7 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption ) , and slight ( not statistically significant ) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0 . 25 mg / kg / day and above ( 1 . 3 times MRHD based on BSA comparison and assuming 100 % absorption ) were observed .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of TWYNEO Cream was evaluated in the treatment of acne vulgaris in two multicenter , randomized , double - blind , vehicle - controlled trials [ Trial NCT03761784 ) , Trial 2 ( NCT03761810 ) ] , which were identical in design .
The trials were conducted in 858 subjects 9 years of age and older , with facial acne vulgaris who were treated once daily for 12 weeks with either TWYNEO Cream or vehicle .
Subjects were required to have a score of moderate ( 3 ) or severe ( 4 ) on the Investigator Global Assessment ( IGA ) , 20 to 100 inflammatory lesions ( papules , pustules and nodules ) , 30 to 150 non - inflammatory lesions ( open and closed comedones ) and two or fewer facial nodules .
Overall , 73 % of subjects were White and 59 % were female .
Eighteen ( 18 ) ( 2 % ) subjects were 9 to 11 years of age , 370 ( 43 % ) subjects were 12 to 17 years of age , and 470 ( 55 % ) subjects were 18 years of age or older .
At baseline , subjects had a mean inflammatory lesion count of 30 . 7 and a mean non - inflammatory lesion count of 46 . 4 .
Additionally , 91 % of subjects had an IGA score of 3 ( " moderate " ) .
The co - primary efficacy endpoints were the absolute change from baseline in non - inflammatory lesion count , and absolute change in inflammatory lesion count at Week 12 and the proportion of subjects with treatment success at Week 12 , defined as an IGA score of 0 ( " clear " ) or 1 ( " almost clear " ) , and at least a two - grade improvement ( decrease ) from baseline at Week 12 .
The efficacy results are provided in Table 4 .
