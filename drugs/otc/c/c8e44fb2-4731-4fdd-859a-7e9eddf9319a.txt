( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Elevated transaminases ( ALT or AST ) : Transaminases ( ALT and AST ) should be assessed prior to initiating SYMDEKO , every 3 months during the first year of treatment , and annually thereafter .
In patients with a history of transaminase elevations , more frequent monitoring should be considered .
Dosing should be interrupted in patients with significant elevations of transaminases , e . g . , patients with ALT or AST > 5 × upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , or ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with bilirubin > 2 × ULN .
Following resolution of transaminase elevations , consider the benefits and risks of resuming treatment .
( 5 . 1 , 6 ) • Use with CYP3A inducers : Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers ( e . g . , rifampin , St . John ' s wort ) substantially decrease exposure of ivacaftor and may decrease the exposure of tezacaftor , which may reduce therapeutic effectiveness .
Therefore , co - administration is not recommended .
( 5 . 2 , 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) • Cataracts : Non - congenital lens opacities / cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with SYMDEKO .
Baseline and follow - up examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating SYMDEKO treatment .
( 5 . 3 , 8 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Transaminase ( AST / ALT ) Elevations Elevated transaminases have been observed in patients with CF treated with SYMDEKO , as well as with ivacaftor monotherapy .
Assessments of transaminases ( ALT and AST ) are recommended for all patients prior to initiating SYMDEKO , every 3 months during the first year of treatment , and annually thereafter .
For patients with a history of transaminase elevations more frequent monitoring should be considered .
In the event of significant elevations of transaminases , e . g . , patients with ALT or AST > 5 × upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , or ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with bilirubin > 2 × ULN , dosing should be interrupted and laboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve .
Following the resolution of transaminase elevations consider the benefits and risks of resuming treatment [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
5 . 2 Concomitant Use with CYP3A Inducers Exposure to ivacaftor is significantly decreased and exposure to tezacaftor may be reduced by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers , which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of SYMDEKO .
Therefore , co - administration with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 3 Cataracts Cases of non - congenital lens opacities have been reported in pediatric patients treated with SYMDEKO , as well as with ivacaftor monotherapy .
Although other risk factors were present in some cases ( such as corticosteroid use , exposure to radiation ) , a possible risk attributable to treatment with SYMDEKO cannot be excluded .
Baseline and follow - up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating treatment with SYMDEKO [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label : • Transaminase Elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Cataracts [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] The most common adverse drug reactions to SYMDEKO ( occurring in ≥ 3 % of patients ) were headache , nausea , sinus congestion , and dizziness .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The overall safety profile of SYMDEKO is based on data from 1001 patients in three double - blind , placebo - controlled , clinical trials : two parallel - group trials of 12 and 24 week duration and one cross - over design trial of 8 weeks duration .
Eligible patients were also able to participate in an open - label extension safety study ( up to 96 weeks of SYMDEKO ) .
In the three placebo - controlled trials ( Trials 1 , 2 , and 3 ) , a total of 496 patients with CF age 12 years and older received at least one dose of SYMDEKO .
The proportion of patients who discontinued study drug prematurely due to adverse reactions was 1 . 6 % for SYMDEKO - treated patients and 2 . 0 % for placebo - treated patients .
Serious adverse reactions , whether considered drug - related or not by the investigators , that occurred more frequently in SYMDEKO - treated patients compared to placebo included distal intestinal obstruction syndrome , 3 ( 0 . 6 % ) SYMDEKO - treated patients vs . 0 placebo .
There were no deaths in the placebo - controlled trials , and one death in the open label extension study due to respiratory failure and influenza infection in a patient who had discontinued SYMDEKO seven weeks prior .
The safety profile of SYMDEKO was generally similar across all subgroups of patients , including analysis by age , sex , baseline percent predicted FEV1 ( ppFEV1 ) , and geographic regions .
Table 5 shows adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 3 % of SYMDEKO - treated patients that also occurred at a higher rate than in the placebo - treated patients in the 12 - and 24 - week placebo controlled , parallel - group trials ( Trials 1 and 3 ) .
Table 5 : Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in ≥ 3 % of SYMDEKO - Treated Patients and Greater than PlaceboAdverse Reactions ( Preferred Term ) SYMDEKO N = 334 n ( % ) Placebo N = 343 n ( % ) Headache 49 ( 15 ) 44 ( 13 ) Nausea 29 ( 9 ) 24 ( 7 ) Sinus congestion 13 ( 4 ) 6 ( 2 ) Dizziness 12 ( 4 ) 8 ( 2 ) The safety data from the following trials are similar to that observed in Trials 1 and 3 : • an 8 - week randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled crossover study in 244 patients with CF age 12 years and older who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor / ivacaftor ( Trial 2 ) .
• a 24 - week open - label study in 70 patients with CF age 6 to less than 12 years who were either homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor / ivacaftor ( Trial 4 ) .
Laboratory abnormalities Transaminase elevations During the placebo - controlled trials in patients age 12 years and older , the incidence of maximum transaminase ( ALT or AST ) > 8 , > 5 , and > 3 × the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) was similar between SYMDEKO - treated patients and placebo - treated patients ; 0 . 2 % , 1 . 0 % , and 3 . 4 % in SYMDEKO - treated patients , and 0 . 4 % , 1 . 0 % , and 3 . 4 % in placebo - treated patients .
One patient ( 0 . 2 % ) on SYMDEKO and 2 patients ( 0 . 4 % ) on placebo permanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases .
No SYMDEKO - treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation > 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin > 2 × ULN .
During the 24 - week , open - label study in patients age 6 to less than 12 years ( Trial 4 ) , the incidence of maximum transaminase ( ALT or AST ) > 8 , > 5 , and > 3 × ULN were 1 . 4 % , 4 . 3 % , and 10 . 0 % , respectively .
No SYMDEKO - treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation > 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or discontinued SYMDEKO treatment due to transaminase elevations .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Potential for other drugs to affect tezacaftor / ivacaftor CYP3A inhibitors : Reduce SYMDEKO dose when co - administered with strong ( e . g . , ketoconazole ) or moderate ( e . g . , fluconazole ) CYP3A inhibitors .
Avoid food containing grapefruit .
( 2 . 4 , 7 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Inducers of CYP3A Tezacaftor and ivacaftor are substrates of CYP3A ( ivacaftor is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A ) .
Concomitant use of CYP3A inducers may result in reduced exposures and thus reduced SYMDEKO efficacy .
Co - administration of ivacaftor with rifampin , a strong CYP3A inducer , significantly decreased ivacaftor exposure ( area under the curve [ AUC ] ) by 89 % .
Tezacaftor exposures can also be expected to decrease significantly during co - administration with strong CYP3A inducers .
Therefore , co - administration of SYMDEKO with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Examples of strong CYP3A inducers include : • rifampin , rifabutin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , phenytoin , and St . John ' s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) 7 . 2 Inhibitors of CYP3A Co - administration with itraconazole , a strong CYP3A inhibitor , increased tezacaftor exposure ( AUC ) by 4 . 0 - fold and ivacaftor by 15 . 6 - fold .
When co - administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors , the dosing regimen of SYMDEKO should be adjusted [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Examples of strong CYP3A inhibitors include : • ketoconazole , itraconazole , posaconazole , and voriconazole • telithromycin and clarithromycin Co - administration of fluconazole increased ivacaftor exposure ( AUC ) by 3 . 0 - fold .
Simulation suggested co - administration with fluconazole , a moderate CYP3A inhibitor , may increase tezacaftor exposure ( AUC ) by approximately 2 . 0 - fold .
When co - administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors , the dosing regimen of SYMDEKO should be adjusted [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Examples of moderate CYP3A inhibitors include : • fluconazole • erythromycin Co - administration of SYMDEKO with grapefruit juice , which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A , may increase exposure of tezacaftor and ivacaftor ; therefore , food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with SYMDEKO [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
7 . 3 Ciprofloxacin Co - administration of SYMDEKO with ciprofloxacin had no significant effect on the exposure of tezacaftor or ivacaftor .
Therefore , no dose adjustment is necessary during concomitant administration of SYMDEKO with ciprofloxacin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Potential for tezacaftor / ivacaftor to affect other drugs 7 . 4CYP3A Substrates Co - administration of SYMDEKO with midazolam ( oral ) , a sensitive CYP3A substrate , did not affect midazolam exposure .
No dose adjustment of CYP3A substrates is required when co - administered with SYMDEKO [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 5 CYP2C9 Substrates Ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9 ; therefore , monitoring of the international normalized ratio ( INR ) during co administration of SYMDEKO with warfarin is recommended .
Other medicinal products for which exposure may be increased by SYMDEKO include glimepiride and glipizide ; these medicinal products should be used with caution [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 6 Digoxin and Other P - gp Substrates Co - administration of SYMDEKO with digoxin , a sensitive P - gp substrate , increased digoxin exposure by 1 . 3 - fold consistent with weak inhibition of P - gp by ivacaftor .
Administration of SYMDEKO may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P - gp , which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions .
When used concomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P - gp with a narrow therapeutic index such as cyclosporine , everolimus , sirolimus , and tacrolimus , caution and appropriate monitoring should be used [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 7 Hormonal Contraceptives SYMDEKO has been studied with an ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone oral contraceptive and was found to have no significant effect on the exposures of the hormonal contraceptive .
SYMDEKO is not expected to modify the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are limited and incomplete human data from clinical trials and post - marketing reports on the use of SYMDEKO or its individual components , tezacaftor and ivacaftor , in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk .
Although there are no animal reproduction studies with the concomitant administration of tezacaftor and ivacaftor , separate reproductive and developmental studies were conducted with tezacaftor and ivacaftor in pregnant rats and rabbits .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of tezacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no teratogenicity or adverse developmental effects at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 3 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) in rats and 0 . 2 times the MRHD in rabbits ( based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1 metabolite ) .
Oral administration of ivacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no teratogenicity or adverse developmental effects at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 6 and 16 times the exposure at the MRHD , respectively .
No adverse developmental effects were observed after oral administration of either tezacaftor or ivacaftor to pregnant rats from the period of organogenesis through lactation at doses that produced maternal exposures approximately 1 and 4 times the exposures at the MRHD , respectively ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Tezacaftor In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 - 17 , tezacaftor was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 3 times the MRHD ( based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1 metabolite at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg / kg / day ) .
In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 - 20 , tezacaftor was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 0 . 2 times the MRHD ( based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1 metabolite at maternal oral doses up to 25 mg / kg / day ) .
Lower fetal body weights were observed in rabbits at a maternally toxic dose that produced exposures approximately 1 times the MRHD ( at a maternal dose of 50 mg / kg / day ) .
In a pre - and postnatal development ( PPND ) study in pregnant rats dosed from gestation Day 6 through lactation Day 18 , tezacaftor had no adverse developmental effects on pups at an exposure of approximately 1 times the MRHD ( based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1 metabolite at a maternal dose of 25 mg / kg / day ) .
Decreased fetal body weights and early developmental delays in pinna detachment , eye opening , and righting reflex occurred at a maternally toxic dose ( based on maternal weight loss ) that produced exposures approximately 2 times the exposure at the MRHD ( based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1 metabolite at a maternal oral dose of 50 mg / kg / day ) .
Placental transfer of tezacaftor was observed in pregnant rats .
Ivacaftor In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 - 17 , ivacaftor was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal survival at exposures up to 6 times the MRHD ( based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at a maternal oral dose of 200 mg / kg / day ) .
In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 - 19 , ivacaftor was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 16 times the MRHD ( on an ivacaftor AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg / kg / day ) .
In a PPND study in pregnant rats dosed from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20 , ivacaftor had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at exposures up to 4 times the MRHD ( based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg / kg / day ) .
Decreased fetal body weights were observed at a maternally toxic dose that produced exposures 6 times the MRHD .
Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of tezacaftor or ivacaftor in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Both tezacaftor and ivacaftor are excreted into the milk of lactating rats ( see Data ) .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for SYMDEKO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from SYMDEKO or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data Tezacaftor Lacteal excretion of tezacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose ( 30 mg / kg ) of 14 C - tezacaftor administered 6 to 10 days postpartum to lactating dams .
Exposure of 14 C - tezacaftor in milk was approximately 3 times higher than in plasma ( based on AUC0 - 72 h ) .
Ivacaftor Lacteal excretion of ivacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose ( 100 mg / kg ) of 14 C - ivacaftor administered 9 to 10 days postpartum to lactating dams .
Exposure of 14 C - ivacaftor in milk was approximately 1 . 5 times higher than in plasma ( based on AUC0 - 24 h ) .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of SYMDEKO for the treatment of CF have been established in pediatric patients age 6 to less than 18 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who have at least one mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to tezacaftor / ivacaftor based on in vitro data and / or clinical evidence [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Clinical trials included the following patients with CF : • 12 to less than 18 years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
• 12 to less than 18 years of age who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor / ivacaftor [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
• 6 to less than 12 years of age who are either homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor / ivacaftor [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ] The effectiveness of SYMDEKO in patients age 6 to less than 12 years was extrapolated from patients age 12 years and older with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses showing similar tezacaftor and ivacaftor exposure levels in patients age 6 to less than 12 years and in patients age 12 years and older [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Safety of SYMDEKO in this population was derived from a 24 - week , open - label , clinical trial in 70 patients age 6 to less than 12 years ( mean age at screening 8 . 1 years ) administered either tezacaftor 50 mg / ivacaftor 75 mg and ivacaftor 75 mg or tezacaftor 100 mg / ivacaftor 150 mg and ivacaftor 150 mg , 12 hours apart ( Trial 4 ) .
The safety profile for patients in this trial was similar to that observed in Trials 1 and 3 [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of SYMDEKO in patients with CF younger than 6 years of age have not been studied .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal Day 7 through 35 with ivacaftor dose levels of 10 mg / kg / day and higher ( 0 . 25 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites ) .
This finding has not been observed in older animals .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of SYMDEKO did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A ) .
A reduced dose of SYMDEKO is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B ) .
There is no experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) , but tezacaftor / ivacaftor exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment .
Therefore , use with caution at a reduced dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment after weighing the risks and benefits of treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment SYMDEKO has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or in patients with end - stage renal disease .
No dose adjustment is recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment .
Caution is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment or end - stage renal disease [ Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Patients with Severe Lung Dysfunction Trial 1 and Trial 2 included a total of 39 SYMDEKO - treated patients with ppFEV1 < 40 at baseline ( range 30 - 40 ) ; 23 patients in Trial 1 and 16 patients in Trial 2 .
There were 24 placebo - treated patients in Trial 1 , and 15 placebo - and 13 ivacaftor - treated patients in Trial 2 , with ppFEV1 < 40 at baseline .
The safety and efficacy in this subgroup were comparable to the overall results observed in both Trials 1 and 2 .
10 OVERDOSAGE No specific antidote is available for overdose with SYMDEKO .
Treatment of overdosage consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient .

Its molecular formula is C26H27N2F3O6 and its molecular weight is 520 . 50 .
Tezacaftor has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Ivacaftor Ivacaftor is a white to off - white powder that is practically insoluble in water ( < 0 . 05 microgram / mL ) .
Pharmacologically it is a CFTR potentiator .
Its chemical name is N - ( 2 , 4 - di - tert - butyl - 5 - hydroxyphenyl ) - 1 , 4 - dihydro - 4 - oxoquinoline - 3 - carboxamide .
Its molecular formula is C24H28N2O3 and its molecular weight is 392 . 49 .
Ivacaftor has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Tezacaftor facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of select mutant forms of CFTR ( including F508del - CFTR ) to increase the amount of mature CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface .
Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel - open probability ( or gating ) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface .
For ivacaftor to function CFTR protein must be present at the cell surface .
Ivacaftor can potentiate the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by tezacaftor , leading to a further enhancement of chloride transport than either agent alone .
The combined effect of tezacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface , resulting in increases in chloride transport .
CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid ( FRT ) cells expressing mutant CFTR The chloride transport response of mutant CFTR protein to tezacaftor / ivacaftor was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of FRT cell lines transfected with individual CFTR mutations .
Tezacaftor / ivacaftor increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing CFTR mutations that result in CFTR protein being delivered to the cell surface .
The in vitro chloride transport response threshold was designated as a net increase of at least 10 % of normal over baseline because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical benefit .
For individual mutations , the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR - mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response .
Note that splice site mutations cannot be studied in the FRT assay .
Table 6 lists responsive CFTR mutations based on ( 1 ) a clinical FEV1 response and / or ( 2 ) in vitro data in FRT cells , indicating that tezacaftor / ivacaftor increases chloride transport to at least 10 % of normal over baseline .
CFTR gene mutations that are not responsive to ivacaftor alone are not expected to respond to SYMDEKO except for F508del homozygotes .

12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on Sweat Chloride In Trial 1 ( patients age 12 years and older who were homozygous for the F508del mutation ) , the treatment difference between SYMDEKO and placebo in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 24 was - 10 . 1 mmol / L ( 95 % CI : - 11 . 4 , - 8 . 8 ) .
In Trial 2 ( patients age 12 years and older who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor / ivacaftor ) , the treatment difference in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 8 was - 9 . 5 mmol / L ( 95 % CI : - 11 . 7 , - 7 . 3 ) between SYMDEKO and placebo , and - 4 . 5 mmol / L ( 95 % CI : - 6 . 7 , - 2 . 3 ) between ivacaftor and placebo .
In Trial 4 ( patients age 6 to less than 12 years ) a reduction in sweat chloride was observed from baseline through Week 4 and sustained throughout the 24 - week treatment period .
Mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through Week 24 was - 14 . 5 mmol / L ( 95 % CI : - 17 . 4 , - 11 . 6 ) .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 3 times the maximum approved recommended dose , tezacaftor does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
In a separate study of ivacaftor evaluating doses up to 3 times the maximum approved recommended dose , ivacaftor does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF . Following once - daily dosing of tezacaftor and twice - daily dosing of ivacaftor in patients with CF , plasma concentrations of tezacaftor and ivacaftor reach steady - state within 8 days and within 3 to 5 days , respectively , after starting treatment .
At steady - state , the accumulation ratio is approximately 1 . 5 for tezacaftor and 2 . 2 for ivacaftor .
Exposures of tezacaftor ( administered alone or in combination with ivacaftor ) increase in an approximately dose - proportional manner with increasing doses from 10 mg to 300 mg once daily .
Key pharmacokinetic parameters for tezacaftor and ivacaftor at steady state are shown in Table 7 .
Table 7 : Mean ( SD ) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Tezacaftor and Ivacaftor at Steady State in Patients with CF Drug Cmax ( mcg / mL ) Effective t ½ ( h ) AUC0 - 24 h or AUC0 - 12 h ( mcg ∙ h / mL ) [ 1 ] Tezacaftor 100 mg once daily / ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours Tezacaftor 5 . 95 ( 1 . 50 ) 15 . 0 ( 3 . 44 ) 84 . 5 ( 27 . 8 ) Ivacaftor 1 . 17 ( 0 . 424 ) 13 . 7 ( 6 . 06 ) 11 . 3 ( 4 . 60 ) [ 1 ] AUC0 - 24 h for tezacaftor and AUC0 - 12 h for ivacaftor Absorption After a single dose in healthy subjects in the fed state , tezacaftor was absorbed with a median ( range ) time to maximum concentration ( tmax ) of approximately 4 hours ( 2 to 6 hours ) .
The median ( range ) tmax of ivacaftor was approximately 6 hours ( 3 to 10 hours ) in the fed state .
When a single dose of tezacaftor / ivacaftor was administered with fat - containing foods , tezacaftor exposure was similar and ivacaftor exposure was approximately 3 times higher than when taken in a fasting state .
Distribution Tezacaftor is approximately 99 % bound to plasma proteins , primarily to albumin .
Ivacaftor is approximately 99 % bound to plasma proteins , primarily to alpha 1 - acid glycoprotein and albumin .
After oral administration of tezacaftor 100 mg once daily / ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours in patients with CF in the fed state , the mean ( ± SD ) for apparent volume of distribution of tezacaftor and ivacaftor was 271 ( 157 ) L and 206 ( 82 . 9 ) L , respectively .
Neither tezacaftor nor ivacaftor partition preferentially into human red blood cells .
Elimination After oral administration of tezacaftor 100 mg once daily / ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours in patients with CF in the fed state , the mean ( ± SD ) for apparent clearance values of tezacaftor and ivacaftor were 1 . 31 ( 0 . 41 ) and 15 . 7 ( 6 . 38 ) L / h , respectively .
After steady - state dosing of tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients with CF , the effective half - lives of tezacaftor and ivacaftor were approximately 15 ( 3 . 44 ) and 13 . 7 ( 6 . 06 ) hours , respectively .
Metabolism Tezacaftor is metabolized extensively in humans .
In vitro data suggested that tezacaftor is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 .
Following oral administration of a single dose of 100 mg 14 C - tezacaftor to healthy male subjects , M1 , M2 , and M5 were the three major circulating metabolites of tezacaftor in humans .
M1 has the similar potency to that of tezacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active .
M2 is much less pharmacologically active than tezacaftor or M1 , and M5 is not considered pharmacologically active .
Another minor circulating metabolite , M3 , is formed by direct glucuronidation of tezacaftor .
Ivacaftor is also metabolized extensively in humans .
In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 .
M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans .
M1 has approximately one - sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active .
M6 is not considered pharmacologically active .
Excretion Following oral administration of 14 C - tezacaftor , the majority of the dose ( 72 % ) was excreted in the feces ( unchanged or as the M2 metabolite ) and about 14 % was recovered in urine ( mostly as M2 metabolite ) , resulting in a mean overall recovery of 86 % up to 21 days after the dose .
Less than 1 % of the administrated dose was excreted in urine as unchanged tezacaftor , showing that renal excretion is not the major pathway of tezacaftor elimination in humans .
Following oral administration of ivacaftor alone , the majority of ivacaftor ( 87 . 8 % ) is eliminated in the feces after metabolic conversion .
There was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine ( only 6 . 6 % of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine ) , and there was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged drug .
Specific Populations Based on population PK analyses , the PK exposure parameters of tezacaftor / ivacaftor in children and adolescents ( ages 6 to < 18 years ) are similar to the AUCss range observed in adults when given in combination .
Pediatric patients age 6 to less than 12 years Table 8 : Tezacaftor / ivacaftor exposure by age group , mean ( SD ) Age Group Dose tezacaftor AUCss mcg ∙ h / mL [ 1 ] ivacaftor AUCss mcg ∙ h / mL null 6 to < 12 years [ 2 ] 71 . 3 ( 28 . 3 ) 8 . 5 ( 3 . 34 ) 6 to < 12 years ( < 30 kg ) tezacaftor 50 mg / ivacaftor 75 mg 56 . 7 ( 22 . 3 ) 6 . 92 ( 2 . 07 ) 6 to < 12 years ( ≥ 30 kg ) null tezacaftor 100 mg / ivacaftor 150 mg 92 . 7 ( 21 . 9 ) 10 . 8 ( 3 . 52 ) [ 1 ] AUC 0 - 24 h for tezacaftor and AUC 0 - 12 h for ivacaftor [ 2 ] Exposures in ≥ 30 kg weight range are predictions derived from the population PK model Pediatric patients age 12 to less than 18 years Following oral administration of SYMDEKO tablets , tezacaftor 100 mg once daily / ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours , the mean ( ± SD ) AUCss for tezacaftor and ivacaftor was 97 . 1 ( 35 . 8 ) mcg ∙ h / mL and 11 . 4 ( 5 . 50 ) mcg ∙ h / mL , respectively , similar to the mean AUCss in adult patients administered SYMDEKO tablets , tezacaftor 100 mg once daily / ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple doses of tezacaftor and ivacaftor for 10 days , patients with moderately impaired hepatic function ( Child - Pugh Class B , score 7 - 9 ) had an approximately 36 % increase in AUC and a 10 % increase in Cmax for tezacaftor , and a 1 . 5 - fold increase in ivacaftor AUC compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics .
In a separate study , patients with moderately impaired hepatic function ( Child - Pugh Class B , score 7 - 9 ) had similar ivacaftor Cmax , but an approximately 2 . 0 - fold increase in ivacaftor AUC0 - ∞ compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics .
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in patients with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A , score 5 - 6 ) or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C , score 10 - 15 ) receiving SYMDEKO .
The magnitude of increase in exposure in patients with severe hepatic impairment is unknown but is expected to be higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Patients with Renal Impairment SYMDEKO has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL / min ) or in patients with end - stage renal disease .
In a human pharmacokinetic study with tezacaftor alone , there was minimal elimination of tezacaftor and its metabolites in urine ( only 13 . 7 % of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine with 0 . 79 % as unchanged drug ) .
In a human pharmacokinetic study with ivacaftor alone , there was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine ( only 6 . 6 % of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine ) .
In population pharmacokinetic analysis , data from 665 patients on tezacaftor or tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in clinical trials indicated that mild renal impairment ( N = 147 ; eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) and moderate renal impairment ( N = 7 ; eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) did not affect the clearance of tezacaftor significantly [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .

Tezacaftor A 2 - year study in Sprague - Dawley rats and a 6 - month study in Tg . rasH2 transgenic mice were conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of tezacaftor .
No evidence of tumorigenicity from tezacaftor was observed in male and female rats at oral doses up to 50 and 75 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 and 3 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and its metabolites in males and females , respectively ) .
No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in male and female Tg . rasH2 transgenic mice at tezacaftor doses up to 500 mg / kg / day .
Tezacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays : Ames test for bacterial gene mutation , in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells , and in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
There were no effects on male or female fertility and early embryonic development in rats at oral tezacaftor doses up to 100 mg / kg / day ( approximately 3 times the MRHD based on summed AUC of tezacaftor and M1 metabolite ) .
Ivacaftor Two - year studies were conducted in CD - 1 mice and Sprague - Dawley rats to assess the carcinogenic potential of ivacaftor .
No evidence of tumorigenicity from ivacaftor was observed in mice or rats at oral doses up to 200 mg / kg / day and 50 mg / kg / day , respectively ( approximately equivalent to 2 and 9 times the MRHD , respectively , based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites ) .
Ivacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays : Ames test for bacterial gene mutation , in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells , and in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
Ivacaftor impaired fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at 200 mg / kg / day ( approximately 9 and 6 times , respectively , the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites ) .
Increases in prolonged diestrus were observed in females at 200 mg / kg / day .
Ivacaftor also increased the number of females with all nonviable embryos and decreased corpora lutea , implantations , and viable embryos in rats at 200 mg / kg / day ( approximately 6 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites ) when dams were dosed prior to and during early pregnancy .
These impairments of fertility and reproductive performance in male and female rats at 200 mg / kg / day were attributed to severe toxicity .
No effects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance indices were observed at ≤ 100 mg / kg / day ( approximately 6 and 4 times , respectively , the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Dose Ranging : Dose selection for the clinical program primarily consisted of one double - blind , placebo - controlled , multiple - cohort trial which included 176 patients with CF ( homozygous for the F508del mutation ) 18 years of age and older with a screening ppFEV1 ≥ 40 .
In the study , 34 and 106 patients , respectively , received tezacaftor at once - daily doses of 10 mg , 30 mg , 100 mg , or 150 mg alone or in combination with ivacaftor 150 mg q12h , and 33 patients received placebo .
During the 28 - day treatment period , dose - dependent increases in mean ppFEV1 change from baseline were observed with tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor .
Tezacaftor / ivacaftor in general had a greater mean treatment effect than tezacaftor alone .
No additional benefit was observed at tezacaftor doses greater than 100 mg daily .
Efficacy : The efficacy of SYMDEKO in patients with CF age 12 years and older was evaluated in three double - blind , placebo - controlled trials ( Trials1 , 2 , and 3 ) .
Trial 1 was a 24 - week randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , two - arm study in patients with CF who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene .
Trial 2 was a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , 2 - period , 3 - treatment , 8 - week crossover study in patients with CF who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor / ivacaftor .
Mutations predicted to be responsive were selected for the study based on the clinical phenotype ( pancreatic sufficiency ) , biomarker data ( sweat chloride ) , and in vitro responsiveness to tezacaftor / ivacaftor [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Patients were randomized to and received sequences of treatment that included SYMDEKO , ivacaftor , and placebo .
Trial 3 was a 12 - week randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , two - arm study in patients with CF who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second CFTR mutation predicted to be unresponsive to tezacaftor / ivacaftor .
Mutations predicted to be non - responsive were selected for the study based on biologic plausibility ( mutation class ) , clinical phenotype ( pancreatic insufficiency ) , biomarker data ( sweat chloride ) , and in vitro testing to tezacaftor and / or ivacaftor .
Patients in all trials continued on their standard - of - care CF therapies ( e . g . , bronchodilators , inhaled antibiotics , dornase alfa , and hypertonic saline ) and were eligible to roll over into a 96 - week open - label extension .
Patients had a ppFEV1 at screening between 40 - 90 % .
Patients with a history of colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status such as Burkholderia cenocepacia , Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus , or who had 2 or more abnormal liver function tests at screening ( ALT , AST , AP , GGT ≥ 3 × ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN ) or AST or ALT ≥ 5 × ULN , were excluded from the trials .
14 . 1 Trial in Patients with CF Who Were Homozygous for the F508del Mutation in the CFTR Gene ( Trial 1 ) Trial 1 evaluated 504 patients ( 248 SYMDEKO , 256 placebo ) with CF age 12 years and older ( mean age 26 . 3 years ) .
The mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 60 . 0 % ( range : 27 . 8 % to 96 . 2 % ) .
The primary efficacy endpoint was change in lung function as determined by absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 .
Treatment with SYMDEKO resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 .
The treatment difference between SYMDEKO and placebo for the mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 4 . 0 percentage points ( 95 % CI : 3 . 1 , 4 . 8 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) .
These changes persisted throughout the 24 - week treatment period ( Figure 2 ) .
Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age , sex , baseline ppFEV1 , colonization with Pseudomonas , concomitant use of standard - of - care medications for CF , and geographic region .
Key secondary efficacy variables included relative change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 ; number of pulmonary exacerbations from baseline through Week 24 ; absolute change in BMI from baseline at Week 24 , and absolute change in CFQ - R Respiratory Domain Score ( a measure of respiratory symptoms relevant to patients with CF , such as cough , sputum production , and difficulty breathing ) from baseline through Week 24 .
For the purposes of this trial , a pulmonary exacerbation was defined as a change in antibiotic therapy ( IV , inhaled , or oral ) as a result of 4 or more of 12 pre - specified sino - pulmonary signs / symptoms .
See Table 11 for a summary of key secondary outcomes in Trial 1 .

The mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 62 . 3 % ( range : 34 . 6 to 93 . 5 ) .
Of the 244 patients included in the efficacy analysis , 146 patients had a splice mutation and 98 patients had a missense mutation as the second allele .
161 patients received SYMDEKO , 156 patients received ivacaftor , and 161 patients received placebo .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean absolute change from study baseline in percent predicted FEV1 averaged at Weeks 4 and 8 of treatment .
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was absolute change in CFQ - R Respiratory Domain Score from study baseline averaged at Weeks 4 and 8 of treatment .
For the overall population , treatment with SYMDEKO compared to placebo resulted in significant improvement in ppFEV1 ( 6 . 8 percentage points [ 95 % CI : 5 . 7 , 7 . 8 ] ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and CFQ - R Respiratory Domain Score ( 11 . 1 points ( 95 % CI 8 . 7 , 13 . 6 ) ; P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Treatment difference for ppFEV1 between ivacaftor - and placebo - treated patients was 4 . 7 percentage points ( 95 % CI : 3 . 7 , 5 . 8 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and 2 . 1 percentage points ( 95 % CI : 1 . 2 , 2 . 9 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) between SYMDEKO - and ivacaftor - treated patients , which were statistically significant .
Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age , baseline ppFEV1 , sex , mutation class , colonization with Pseudomonas , concomitant use of standard - of - care medications for CF , and geographic region .
Statistically significant improvements compared to placebo were also observed in the subgroup of patients with splice mutations and missense mutations ( Table 12 ) .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA - approved patient labeling ( Patient Information ) .
Transaminase ( ALT or AST ) Elevations and Monitoring Inform patients that elevation in liver tests has occurred in patients treated with SYMDEKO or with ivacaftor alone .
Transaminases ( ALT and AST ) should be assessed prior to initiating SYMDEKO , every 3 months during the first year of treatment , and annually thereafter .
More frequent monitoring should be considered in patients with a history of transaminase elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Drug Interactions with CYP3A Inducers and Inhibitors Ask patients to tell you all the medications they are taking including any herbal supplements or vitamins .
Co - administration of SYMDEKO with strong CYP3A inducers ( e . g . , rifampin , St . John ' s wort ) is not recommended , as they may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of SYMDEKO .
Adjustment of the dose to one tablet of tezacaftor / ivacaftor twice a week , taken approximately 3 to 4 days apart is recommended when co - administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors , such as ketoconazole .
Advise the patient not to take the evening dose of ivacaftor .
Dose reduction to one tablet of tezacaftor / ivacaftor or ivacaftor , taken on alternate days in the morning is recommended when co - administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors , such as fluconazole .
Advise the patient not to take the evening dose of ivacaftor .

Adjust the dose in patients with moderately impaired hepatic function ( Child - Pugh Class B , score 7 - 9 ) to one tablet of tezacaftor / ivacaftor once daily in the morning and advise the patient not to take the evening dose of ivacaftor .
SYMDEKO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C , score 10 - 15 ) ; however , exposure is expected to be substantially higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment .
When benefits are expected to outweigh the risks , SYMDEKO should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment at a dose of one tablet of tezacaftor / ivacaftor once daily in the morning or less frequently .
Advise the patient not to take the evening dose of ivacaftor .
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A , score 5 - 6 ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Administration Inform patients that SYMDEKO is best absorbed by the body when taken with food that contains fat .
A typical CF diet will satisfy this requirement .
Examples include eggs , butter , peanut butter , cheese pizza , whole - milk dairy products ( such as whole milk , cheese , and yogurt ) , etc . [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients should be informed about what to do in the event they miss a dose of SYMDEKO or ivacaftor : • If 6 hours or less have passed since the time SYMDEKO is usually taken , patients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose of SYMDEKO with fat - containing food as soon as possible .
• If more than 6 hours have passed since the time SYMDEKO is usually taken , the missed dose should NOT be taken and the patient should resume the usual dosing schedule .
• Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider if they have questions .
