WARNING : RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with KEVZARA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Opportunistic infections have also been reported in patients receiving KEVZARA .
Most patients who developed infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids .
Avoid use of KEVZARA in patients with an active infection .
Reported infections include : • Active tuberculosis , which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease .
Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before KEVZARA use and during therapy .
Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to KEVZARA use .
• Invasive fungal infections , such as candidiasis , and pneumocystis .
Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated , rather than localized , disease .
• Bacterial , viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens .
Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection during treatment with KEVZARA .
If a serious infection develops , interrupt KEVZARA until the infection is controlled .
Consider the risks and benefits of treatment with KEVZARA prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection .

( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Serious Infections : Avoid KEVZARA use during an active infection .
( 5 . 1 ) • Neutropenia , Thrombocytopenia , Elevated Liver Enzymes , Lipid Abnormalities : Monitor laboratory parameters .
( 5 . 2 ) • Gastrointestinal ( GI ) Perforation : Risk may be increased with concurrent diverticulitis or concomitant use of NSAIDs or corticosteroids .
Promptly evaluate acute abdominal signs or symptoms .
( 5 . 3 ) • Hypersensitivity reactions .
( 5 . 5 ) • Live vaccines : Avoid use with KEVZARA due to the risk of infection .
Follow vaccination guidelines .
( 5 . 7 , 7 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Serious Infections Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial , mycobacterial , invasive fungal , viral , or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including KEVZARA for rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .
The most frequently observed serious infections with KEVZARA included pneumonia and cellulitis [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Among opportunistic infections , tuberculosis , candidiasis , and pneumocystis were reported with KEVZARA .
Some patients presented with disseminated rather than localized disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids , which in addition to RA may predispose them to infections .
While not reported in KEVZARA clinical studies , other serious infections ( e . g . , histoplasmosis , cryptococcus , aspergillosis ) have been reported in patients receiving other immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of RA .
Avoid use of KEVZARA in patients with an active infection , including localized infections .
Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating KEVZARA in patients who have : • chronic or recurrent infection ; • a history of serious or opportunistic infections ; • underlying conditions , in addition to RA , that may predispose them to infection ; • been exposed to tuberculosis ; or • lived in or traveled to areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses .
Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during treatment with KEVZARA , as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase reactants [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Hold treatment with KEVZARA if a patient develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection .
Perform prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient who develops a new infection during treatment with KEVZARA ; initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy , and closely monitor the patient .
Tuberculosis Evaluate patients for tuberculosis ( TB ) risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating treatment with KEVZARA .
Treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating KEVZARA .
Consider anti - TB therapy prior to initiation of KEVZARA in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed , and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but having risk factors for TB infection .
When considering anti - TB therapy , consultation with a physician with expertise in TB may be appropriate .
Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB including patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy .
Viral Reactivation Viral reactivation has been reported with immunosuppressive biologic therapies .
Cases of herpes zoster were observed in clinical studies with KEVZARA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The risk of Hepatitis B reactivation with KEVZARA is unknown since patients who were at risk for reactivation were excluded .
5 . 2 Laboratory Abnormalities Neutropenia Treatment with KEVZARA was associated with a higher incidence of decrease in absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) , including neutropenia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
• Assess neutrophil count prior to initiation of KEVZARA and monitor neutrophil count 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
For recommendations regarding initiating KEVZARA therapy and dosage modifications based on ANC results see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 and 2 . 4 ) .
• Based on the pharmacodynamics of the changes in ANC [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] , use results obtained at the end of the dosing interval when considering dose modification .
Thrombocytopenia Treatment with KEVZARA was associated with a reduction in platelet counts in clinical studies [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
• Assess platelet count prior to initiation of KEVZARA and monitor platelets 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter .
For recommendations regarding initiating KEVZARA therapy and dosage modifications based on platelet counts see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 and 2 . 4 ) .
Elevated Liver Enzymes Treatment with KEVZARA was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations .
These elevations were transient and did not result in any clinically evident hepatic injury in clinical studies [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Increased frequency and magnitude of these elevations were observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs ( e . g . , MTX ) were used in combination with KEVZARA .
• Assess ALT / AST levels prior to initiation of KEVZARA and monitor ALT and AST levels 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter .
When clinically indicated , consider other liver function tests such as bilirubin .
For recommendations regarding initiating KEVZARA therapy and dosage modifications based on transaminase elevations see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 and 2 . 4 ) .
Lipid Abnormalities Treatment with KEVZARA was associated with increases in lipid parameters such as LDL cholesterol , HDL cholesterol and / or triglycerides [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
• Assess lipid parameters approximately 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of treatment with KEVZARA , then at approximately 6 month intervals .
• Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia .
5 . 3 Gastrointestinal Perforation Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in clinical studies , primarily as complications of diverticulitis .
GI perforation risk may be increased with concurrent diverticulitis or concomitant use of NSAIDs or corticosteroids .
Promptly evaluate patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 4 Immunosuppression Treatment with immunosuppressants may result in an increased risk of malignancies .
The impact of treatment with KEVZARA on the development of malignancies is not known but malignancies were reported in clinical studies [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with KEVZARA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation were reported in 0 . 3 % of patients in controlled RA trials .
Injection site rash , rash , and urticaria were the most frequent hypersensitivity reactions .
Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction .
If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reaction occurs , stop administration of KEVZARA immediately .
Do not administer KEVZARA to patients with known hypersensitivity to sarilumab [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 6 Active Hepatic Disease and Hepatic Impairment Treatment with KEVZARA is not recommended in patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment , as treatment with KEVZARA was associated with transaminase elevations [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 7 Live Vaccines Avoid concurrent use of live vaccines during treatment with KEVZARA due to potentially increased risk of infections ; clinical safety of live vaccines during KEVZARA treatment has not been established .
No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving KEVZARA .
The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of KEVZARA therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling : • Serious infections [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , elevated liver enzymes , lipid abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Gastrointestinal perforation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Immunosuppression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( incidence at least 3 % ) are neutropenia , increased ALT , injection site erythema , upper respiratory infections and urinary tract infections .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
All patients in the safety data described below had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis .
The safety of KEVZARA in combination with conventional DMARDs was evaluated based on data from seven studies , of which two were placebo - controlled , consisting of 2887 patients ( long - term safety population ) .
Of these , 2170 patients received KEVZARA for at least 24 weeks , 1546 for at least 48 weeks , 1020 for at least 96 weeks , and 624 for at least 144 weeks .
The pre - rescue placebo - controlled population includes patients from the two Phase 3 efficacy studies ( Studies 1 and 2 ) from weeks 0 to 16 for Study 1 and weeks 0 to 12 for Study 2 , and was used to assess common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities prior to patients being permitted to switch from placebo to KEVZARA .
In this population , 582 patients , 579 patients , and 579 patients received KEVZARA 200 mg , KEVZARA 150 mg , or placebo once every two weeks , respectively , in combination with conventional DMARDs .
The 52 - week placebo - controlled population includes patients from one Phase 2 study of 12 week duration and two Phase 3 efficacy studies ( one of 24 week duration and the other of 52 week duration ) .
This placebo - controlled population includes all subjects from the double - blind , placebo - controlled periods from each study and was analyzed under their original randomization assignment .
In this population , 661 patients , 660 patients , and 661 patients received KEVZARA 200 mg , KEVZARA 150 mg , or placebo once every two weeks , respectively , in combination with conventional DMARDs .
Most safety data are described for the pre - rescue population .
For rarer events , the 52 - week placebo - controlled population is used .
The most common serious adverse reactions were infections [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The most frequent adverse reactions ( occurring in at least 3 % of patients treated with KEVZARA in combination with DMARDs ) observed with KEVZARA in the clinical studies were neutropenia , increased ALT , injection site erythema , upper respiratory infections , and urinary tract infections .
In the pre - rescue placebo - controlled population , premature discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 8 % , 6 % and 3 % of patients treated with KEVZARA 200 mg , KEVZARA 150 mg , and placebo , respectively .
The most common adverse reaction ( greater than 1 % ) that resulted in discontinuation of therapy with KEVZARA was neutropenia .
The use of KEVZARA as monotherapy was assessed in 132 patients , of which 67 received KEVZARA 200 mg and 65 patients received KEVZARA 150 mg without concomitant DMARDs .
The safety profile was generally consistent with that in the population receiving concomitant DMARDs .
Overall Infections In the pre - rescue placebo - controlled population , the rate of infections in the 200 mg and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD group was 110 and 105 events per 100 patient - years , respectively , compared to 81 events per 100 patient - years in the placebo + DMARD group .
The most commonly reported infections ( 2 % to 4 % of patients ) were upper respiratory tract infections , urinary tract infections , and nasopharyngitis .
In the 52 - week placebo - controlled population , 0 . 8 % of patients ( 5 patients ) treated with KEVZARA 200 mg + DMARD , 0 . 6 % ( 4 patients ) treated with KEVZARA 150 mg + DMARD and 0 . 5 % ( 3 patients ) treated with placebo + DMARD had an event of herpes zoster [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The overall rate of infections with KEVZARA + DMARD in the long - term safety population was consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies .
Serious Infections In the pre - rescue population , the rate of serious infections in the 200 mg and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD group was 3 . 8 and 4 . 4 events per 100 patient - years , respectively , compared to 2 . 5 events per 100 patient - years in the placebo + DMARD group .
In the 52 - week placebo - controlled population , the rate of serious infections in the 200 mg and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD group was 4 . 3 and 3 . 0 events per 100 patient - years , respectively , compared to 3 . 1 events per 100 patient - years in the placebo + DMARD group .
In the long - term safety population , the overall rate of serious infections was consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies .
The most frequently observed serious infections included pneumonia and cellulitis .
Cases of opportunistic infection have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Gastrointestinal Perforation In the 52 - week placebo - controlled population , one patient on KEVZARA therapy experienced a gastrointestinal ( GI ) perforation ( 0 . 11 events per 100 patient - years ) .
In the long - term safety population , the overall rate of GI perforation was consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies .
Reports of GI perforation were primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis including lower GI perforation and abscess .
Most patients who developed GI perforations were taking concomitant nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory medications ( NSAIDs ) or corticosteroids .
The contribution of these concomitant medications relative to KEVZARA in the development of GI perforations is not known [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Hypersensitivity Reactions In the pre - rescue placebo - controlled population , the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to hypersensitivity reactions was higher among those treated with KEVZARA ( 0 . 3 % in 200 mg , 0 . 2 % in 150 mg ) than placebo ( 0 % ) .
The rate of discontinuations due to hypersensitivity in the long - term safety population was consistent with the placebo - controlled period .
Injection Site Reactions In the pre - rescue placebo - controlled population , injection site reactions were reported in 7 % of patients receiving KEVZARA 200 mg , 6 % receiving KEVZARA 150 mg , and 1 % receiving placebo .
These injection site reactions ( including erythema and pruritus ) were mild in severity for the majority of patients and necessitated drug discontinuation in 2 ( 0 . 2 % ) patients receiving KEVZARA .
Laboratory Abnormalities Decreased neutrophil count In the pre - rescue placebo - controlled population , decreases in neutrophil counts less than 1000 per mm3 occurred in 6 % and 4 % of patients in the 200 mg KEVZARA + DMARD and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD group , respectively , compared to no patients in the placebo + DMARD groups .
Decreases in neutrophil counts less than 500 per mm3 occurred in 0 . 7 % of patients in both the 200 mg KEVZARA + DMARD and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD groups .
Decrease in ANC was not associated with the occurrence of infections , including serious infections .
In the long - term safety population , the observations on neutrophil counts were consistent with what was seen in the placebo - controlled clinical studies [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Decreased platelet count In the pre - rescue placebo - controlled population , decreases in platelet counts less than 100 , 000 per mm3 occurred in 1 % and 0 . 7 % of patients on 200 mg and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD , respectively , compared to no patients on placebo + DMARD , without associated bleeding events .
In the long - term safety population , the observations on platelet counts were consistent with what was seen in the placebo - controlled clinical studies [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Elevated liver enzymes Liver enzyme elevations in the pre - rescue placebo - controlled population ( KEVZARA + DMARD or placebo + DMARD ) are summarized in Table 2 .
In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation , modification of treatment regimen , such as interruption of KEVZARA or reduction in dose , resulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin , nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Table 2 : Incidence of Liver Enzyme Elevations in Adults with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis [ 1 ] Placebo + DMARD N = 579 KEVZARA 150 mg + DMARD N = 579 KEVZARA 200 mg + DMARD N = 582 ULN = Upper Limit of Normal AST Greater than ULN to 3 times ULN or less 15 % 27 % 30 % Greater than 3 times ULN to 5 times ULN 0 % 1 % 1 % Greater than 5 times ULN 0 % 0 . 7 % 0 . 2 % ALT Greater than ULN to 3 times ULN or less 25 % 38 % 43 % Greater than 3 times ULN to 5 times ULN 1 % 4 % 3 % Greater than 5 times ULN 0 % 1 % 0 . 7 % [ 1 ] Phase 3 placebo - controlled safety population through the pre - rescue period Lipid Abnormalities Lipid parameters ( LDL , HDL , and triglycerides ) were first assessed at 4 weeks following initiation of KEVZARA + DMARDs in the placebo - controlled population .
Increases were observed at this time point with no additional increases observed thereafter .
Changes in lipid parameters from baseline to Week 4 are summarized below : • Mean LDL increased by 12 mg / dL in the KEVZARA 150 mg every two weeks + DMARD group and 16 mg / dL in the KEVZARA 200 mg every two weeks + DMARD group .
• Mean triglycerides increased by 20 mg / dL in the KEVZARA 150 mg every two weeks + DMARD group and 27 mg / dL in the KEVZARA 200 mg every two weeks + DMARD group .
• Mean HDL increased by 3 mg / dL in both the KEVZARA 150 mg every two weeks + DMARD and KEVZARA 200 mg every two weeks + DMARD groups .
In the long - term safety population , the observations in lipid parameters were consistent with what was observed in the placebo - controlled clinical studies .
Malignancies In the 52 - week placebo - controlled population , 9 malignancies ( exposure - adjusted event rate of 1 . 0 event per 100 patient - years ) were diagnosed in patients receiving KEVZARA + DMARD compared to 4 malignancies in patients in the control group ( exposure - adjusted event rate of 1 . 0 event per 100 patient - years ) .
In the long - term safety population , the rate of malignancies was consistent with the rate observed in the placebo - controlled period [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Other Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions occurring in 2 % or more of patients on KEVZARA + DMARD and greater than those observed in patients on placebo + DMARD are summarized in Table 3 .
Table 3 : Common Adverse Reactions [ 1 ] in Adults with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis [ 2 ] Preferred Term Placebo + DMARD ( N = 579 ) KEVZARA 150 mg + DMARD ( N = 579 ) KEVZARA 200 mg + DMARD ( N = 582 ) Neutropenia 0 . 2 % 7 % 10 % Alanine aminotransferase increased 2 % 5 % 5 % Injection site erythema 0 . 9 % 5 % 4 % Injection site pruritus 0 . 2 % 2 % 2 % Upper respiratory tract infection 2 % 4 % 3 % Urinary tract infection 2 % 3 % 3 % Hypertriglyceridemia 0 . 5 % 3 % 1 % Leukopenia 0 % 0 . 9 % 2 % [ 1 ] Adverse reactions occurring in 2 % or more in the 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD or 200 mg KEVZARA + DMARD groups and greater than observed in Placebo + DMARD [ 2 ] Pre - rescue , placebo - controlled population Medically relevant adverse reactions occurring at an incidence less than 2 % in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with KEVZARA in controlled studies was oral herpes .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to sarilumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
In the pre - rescue population , 4 . 0 % of patients treated with KEVZARA 200 mg + DMARD , 5 . 7 % of patients treated with KEVZARA 150 mg + DMARD and 1 . 9 % of patients treated with placebo + DMARD , exhibited an anti - drug antibody ( ADA ) response .
Neutralizing antibodies ( NAb ) were detected in 1 . 0 % of patients on KEVZARA 200 mg + DMARD , 1 . 6 % of patients on KEVZARA 150 mg + DMARD , and 0 . 2 % of patients on placebo + DMARD .
In patients treated with KEVZARA monotherapy , 9 . 2 % of patients exhibited an ADA response with 6 . 9 % of patients also exhibiting NAbs .
Prior to administration of KEVZARA , 2 . 3 % of patients exhibited an ADA response .
No correlation was observed between ADA development and either loss of efficacy or adverse reactions .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Use with Other Drugs for Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of methotrexate ( MTX ) on sarilumab clearance .
KEVZARA has not been investigated in combination with JAK inhibitors or biological DMARDs such as TNF antagonists [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
7 . 2 Interactions with CYP450 Substrates Various in vitro and limited in vivo human studies have shown that cytokines and cytokine modulators can influence the expression and activity of specific cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes and therefore have the potential to alter the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates of these enzymes .
Elevated interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) concentration may down - regulate CYP activity such as in patients with RA and hence increase drug levels compared to subjects without RA .
Blockade of IL - 6 signaling by IL - 6Rα antagonists such as KEVZARA might reverse the inhibitory effect of IL - 6 and restore CYP activity , leading to altered drug concentrations .
The modulation of IL - 6 effect on CYP enzymes by KEVZARA may be clinically relevant for CYP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index , where the dose is individually adjusted .
Upon initiation or discontinuation of KEVZARA , in patients being treated with CYP substrate medicinal products , perform therapeutic monitoring of effect ( e . g . , warfarin ) or drug concentration ( e . g . , theophylline ) and adjust the individual dose of the medicinal product as needed .
Exercise caution when coadministering KEVZARA with CYP3A4 substrate drugs where decrease in effectiveness is undesirable , e . g . , oral contraceptives , lovastatin , atorvastatin , etc .
The effect of KEVZARA on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Live Vaccines Avoid concurrent use of live vaccines during treatment with KEVZARA [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to KEVZARA during pregnancy .

Risk Summary The limited human data with KEVZARA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform drug - associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage .
Monoclonal antibodies , such as sarilumab , are actively transported across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in utero exposed infant [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
From animal data , and consistent with the mechanism of action , levels of IgG , in response to antigen challenge , may be reduced in the fetus / infant of treated mothers [ see Clinical Considerations and Data ] .
In an animal reproduction study , consisting of a combined embryo - fetal and pre - and postnatal development study with monkeys that received intravenous administration of sarilumab , there was no evidence of embryotoxicity or fetal malformations with exposures up to approximately 84 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) [ see Data ] .
The literature suggests that inhibition of IL - 6 signaling may interfere with cervical ripening and dilatation and myometrial contractile activity leading to potential delays of parturition [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
KEVZARA should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly transported across the placenta as pregnancy progresses , with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester .
Risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live or live - attenuated vaccines to infants exposed to KEVZARA in utero [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
From the animal data , and consistent with the mechanism of action , levels of IgG , in response to antigen challenge , may be reduced in the fetus / infant of treated mothers [ see Data ] .
Data Animal Data In a combined embryo - fetal and pre - and postnatal development study , pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received sarilumab at intravenous doses of 0 , 5 , 15 , or 50 mg / kg / week from confirmation of pregnancy at gestation day ( GD ) 20 , throughout the period of organogenesis ( up to approximately GD 50 ) , and continuing to natural birth of infants at around GD 165 .
Maintenance of pregnancy was not affected at any doses .
Sarilumab was not embryotoxic or teratogenic with exposures up to approximately 84 times the MRHD ( based on AUC with maternal intravenous doses up to 50 mg / kg / week ) .
Sarilumab had no effect on neonatal growth and development evaluated up to one month after birth .
Sarilumab was detected in the serum of neonates up to one month after birth , suggesting that the antibody had crossed the placenta .
Following antigen challenge , decreased IgG titers attributed to the immunosuppressive action of sarilumab were evident in studies with older monkeys , with exposures up to approximately 80 times the MRHD ( based on AUC with intravenous doses up to 50 mg / kg / week ) and juvenile mice treated with an analogous antibody , which binds to murine IL - 6Rα to inhibit IL - 6 mediated signaling , at subcutaneous doses up to 200 mg / kg / week .
These findings suggest the potential for decreased IgG titers , following antigen challenge , in infants of mothers treated with KEVZARA .
Parturition is associated with significant increases of IL - 6 in the cervix and myometrium .
The literature suggests that inhibition of IL - 6 signaling may interfere with cervical ripening and dilatation and myometrial contractile activity leading to potential delays of parturition .
For mice deficient in IL - 6 ( ll6 - / - null mice ) , parturition was delayed relative to wild - type ( ll6 + / + ) mice .
Administration of recombinant IL - 6 to ll6 - / - null mice restored the normal timing of delivery .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary No information is available on the presence of sarilumab in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant , or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Maternal IgG is present in human milk .
If sarilumab is transferred into human milk , the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract and potential limited systemic exposure in the infant to sarilumab are unknown .
The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes clear determination of the risk of KEVZARA to an infant during lactation ; therefore , the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for KEVZARA and the potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from KEVZARA or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of KEVZARA in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of KEVZARA [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , 15 % were 65 years of age and over , while 1 . 6 % were 75 years and over .
In clinical studies , no overall differences in safety and efficacy were observed between older and younger patients .
The frequency of serious infection among KEVZARA and placebo - treated patients 65 years of age and older was higher than those under the age of 65 .
As there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general , caution should be used when treating the elderly .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment The safety and efficacy of KEVZARA have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment , including patients with positive HBV or HCV serology [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment .
KEVZARA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Sarilumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subclass that binds to the IL - 6 receptor and has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa .
Sarilumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary cell suspension culture .
KEVZARA ( sarilumab ) injection for subcutaneous administration is supplied as a sterile , colorless to pale yellow , preservative - free solution of approximately pH 6 . 0 .
KEVZARA is supplied in a single - dose pre - filled syringe or pre - filled pen .
Each syringe or pen delivers 1 . 14 mL of solution containing 150 mg or 200 mg of sarilumab , arginine ( 8 . 94 mg ) , histidine ( 3 . 71 mg ) , polysorbate 20 ( 2 . 28 mg ) , sucrose ( 57 mg ) and Water for Injection , USP .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Sarilumab binds to both soluble and membrane - bound IL - 6 receptors ( sIL - 6 R and mIL - 6 R ) , and has been shown to inhibit IL - 6 - mediated signaling through these receptors .
IL - 6 is a pleiotropic pro - inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T - and B - cells , lymphocytes , monocytes , and fibroblasts .
IL - 6 has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T - cell activation , induction of immunoglobulin secretion , initiation of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis , and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation and differentiation .
IL - 6 is also produced by synovial and endothelial cells leading to local production of IL - 6 in joints affected by inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Following single - dose subcutaneous administration of sarilumab 200 - mg and 150 - mg in patients with RA , rapid reduction of CRP levels was observed .
Levels were reduced to normal within 2 weeks after treatment initiation .
Following single - dose sarilumab administration , in patients with RA , absolute neutrophil counts decreased to the nadir between 3 to 4 days and thereafter recovered towards baseline [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Treatment with sarilumab resulted in decreases in fibrinogen and serum amyloid A , and increases in hemoglobin and serum albumin .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of sarilumab were characterized in 1770 patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) treated with sarilumab which included 631 patients treated with 150 mg and 682 patients treated with 200 mg doses by subcutaneous injection every two weeks for up to 52 weeks .
The median tmax was observed in 2 to 4 days .
At steady state , exposure over the dosing interval measured by area under curve ( AUC ) increased 2 - fold with an increase in dose from 150 to 200 mg every two weeks .
Steady state was reached in 14 to 16 weeks with a 2 - to 3 - fold accumulation compared to single dose exposure .
For the 150 mg every two weeks dose regimen , the estimated mean ( ± SD ) steady - state AUC , Cmin and Cmax of sarilumab were 202 ± 120 mg . day / L , 6 . 35 ± 7 . 54 mg / L , and 20 . 0 ± 9 . 20 mg / L , respectively .
For the 200 mg every two weeks dose regimen , the estimated mean ( ± SD ) steady - state AUC , Cmin and Cmax of sarilumab were 395 ± 207 mg . day / L , 16 . 5 ± 14 . 1 mg / L , and 35 . 6 ± 15 . 2 mg / L , respectively .
Distribution In patients with RA , the apparent volume of distribution at steady state was 7 . 3 L . Elimination Sarilumab is eliminated by parallel linear and non - linear pathways .
At higher concentrations , the elimination is predominantly through the linear , non - saturable proteolytic pathway , while at lower concentrations , non - linear saturable target - mediated elimination predominates .
The half - life of sarilumab is concentration - dependent .
At 200 mg every 2 weeks , the concentration - dependent half - life is up to 10 days in patients with RA at steady state .
At 150 mg every 2 weeks , the concentration - dependent half - life is up to 8 days in patients with RA at steady state .
After the last steady state dose of 150 mg and 200 mg sarilumab , the median times to non - detectable concentration are 28 and 43 days , respectively .
Population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with RA revealed that there was a trend toward higher apparent clearance of sarilumab in the presence of anti - sarilumab antibodies .
Metabolism The metabolic pathway of sarilumab has not been characterized .
As a monoclonal antibody sarilumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG .
Excretion Monoclonal antibodies , including sarilumab , are not eliminated via renal or hepatic pathways .
Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analyses in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed that age , gender and race did not meaningfully influence the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab .
Although body weight influenced the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab , no dose adjustments are recommended for any of these demographics .
Hepatic impairment No formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab was conducted .
Renal impairment No formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab was conducted .
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from 1770 patients with RA , including patients with mild ( creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) : 60 to 90 mL / min ; N = 471 at baseline ) or moderate ( CLcr : 30 to 60 mL / min ; N = 74 at baseline ) renal impairment , CLcr was correlated with sarilumab exposure .
However , the effect of CLcr on exposure is not sufficient to warrant a dose adjustment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Patients with severe renal impairment were not studied .
Drug - Drug Interactions CYP450 substrates Simvastatin is a CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 substrate .
In 17 patients with RA , one week following a single 200 - mg subcutaneous administration of sarilumab , exposure of simvastatin and simvastatin acid decreased by 45 % and 36 % , respectively [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenicity potential of sarilumab .
Literature indicates that the IL - 6 pathway can mediate anti - tumor responses by promoting increased immune cell surveillance of the tumor microenvironment .
However , available published evidence also supports that IL - 6 signaling through the IL - 6 receptor may be involved in pathways that lead to tumorigenesis .
The malignancy risk in humans from an antibody that disrupts signaling through the IL - 6 receptor , such as sarilumab , is presently unknown .
Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in male and female mice treated with an analogous antibody , which binds to murine IL - 6Rα to inhibit IL - 6 mediated signaling , at subcutaneous doses of 10 , 25 , and 100 mg / kg twice per week .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Design of Clinical Studies in Adults with Moderately to Severely Active RA The efficacy and safety of KEVZARA were assessed in two randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled multicenter studies ( Study 1 and Study 2 ) in patients older than 18 years with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) criteria .
Patients had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline .
Study 1 evaluated 1197 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who had inadequate clinical response to methotrexate ( MTX ) .
Patients received subcutaneous KEVZARA 200 mg , KEVZARA 150 mg , or placebo every two weeks with concomitant MTX .
After Week 16 in Study 1 , patients with an inadequate response could have been rescued with KEVZARA 200 mg every two weeks .
Study 2 evaluated 546 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to one or more TNF - α antagonists .
Patients received subcutaneous KEVZARA 200 mg , KEVZARA 150 mg , or placebo every two weeks with concomitant conventional DMARDs ( MTX , sulfasalazine , leflunomide , and / or hydroxychloroquine ) .
After Week 12 in Study 2 , patients with an inadequate response could have been rescued with KEVZARA 200 mg every two weeks .
In Studies 1 and 2 , the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Week 24 .
Other key endpoints evaluated included change from baseline in HAQ - DI at Week 16 in Study 1 and at Week 12 in Study 2 , and change from baseline in van der Heijde - modified Total Sharp Score ( mTSS ) at Week 52 in Study 1 .
Clinical Response The percentages of KEVZARA every two weeks + MTX / DMARD - treated patients achieving ACR20 , ACR50 and ACR70 responses in Studies 1 and 2 are shown Table 4 .
In both studies , patients treated with either 200 mg or 150 mg of KEVZARA every two weeks + MTX / DMARD had higher ACR20 , ACR50 , and ACR70 response rates versus placebo + MTX / DMARD - treated patients at Week 24 .
In Studies 1 and 2 , a greater proportion of patients treated with KEVZARA 200 mg or 150 mg every two weeks plus MTX / DMARD achieved a low level of disease activity as measured by a Disease Activity Score 28 - C - Reactive Protein ( DAS28 - CRP ) < 2 . 6 compared with placebo + MTX / DMARD at the end of the studies ( Table 4 ) .
In Study 1 , the proportion of patients achieving DAS28 - CRP < 2 . 6 who had at least 3 or more active joints at the end of Week 24 was 33 . 1 % , 37 . 8 % and 20 % , in the KEVZARA 200 mg + MTX / DMARD arm , KEVZARA 150 mg + MTX / DMARD arm , and placebo arm respectively .

Radiographs of hands and feet were obtained at baseline , 24 weeks , and 52 weeks and scored independently by at least two well - trained readers who were blinded to treatment group and visit number .
Both doses of KEVZARA + MTX were superior to placebo + MTX in the change from baseline in mTSS over 52 weeks ( see Table 6 ) .
Less progression of both erosion and joint space narrowing scores over 52 weeks was reported in the KEVZARA + MTX treatment groups compared to the placebo + MTX group .
Treatment with KEVZARA + MTX was associated with significantly less radiographic progression of structural damage as compared with placebo + MTX .
At Week 52 , 55 . 6 % of patients receiving KEVZARA 200 mg + MTX and 47 . 8 % of patients receiving KEVZARA 150 mg + MTX had no progression of structural damage ( as defined by a change in the Total Sharp Score of zero or less ) compared with 38 . 7 % of patients receiving placebo .
