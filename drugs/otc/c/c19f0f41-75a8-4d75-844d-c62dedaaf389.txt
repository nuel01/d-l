( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Gastrointestinal Adverse Events in Patients with Motility Disorders .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Edema .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Hypokalemia in patients on hemodialysis .
( 5 . 3 ) • • LOKELMA has radio - opaque properties and , therefore , may give the appearance typical of an imaging agent during abdominal X - ray procedures .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events in Patients with Motility Disorders Avoid use of LOKELMA in patients with severe constipation , bowel obstruction or impaction , including abnormal post - operative bowel motility disorders , because LOKELMA has not been studied in patients with these conditions and may be ineffective and may worsen gastrointestinal conditions .
5 . 2 Edema Each 5 g dose of LOKELMA contains approximately 400 mg of sodium , but the extent of absorption by the patient is unknown .
In clinical trials of LOKELMA in patients who were not on dialysis , edema was observed and was generally mild to moderate in severity and was more commonly seen in patients treated with 15 g once daily .
Monitor for signs of edema , particularly in patients who should restrict their sodium intake or are prone to fluid overload ( e . g . , heart failure or renal disease ) .
Advise patients to adjust dietary sodium , if appropriate .
Increase the dose of diuretics as needed [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
In a clinical trial of LOKELMA in patients on chronic hemodialysis in which most patients were treated with doses of 5 to 10 g once daily on non - dialysis days , there was no difference in the mean change from baseline in interdialytic weight gain ( a measure of fluid retention ) between the LOKELMA and placebo groups .
5 . 3 Hypokalemia in Patients on Hemodialysis Patients on hemodialysis may be prone to acute illness that can increase the risk of hypokalemia on LOKELMA ( e . g . , illnesses associated with decreased oral intake , diarrhea ) .
Consider adjusting Lokelma dose based on potassium levels in these settings .
5 . 4 Diagnostic Tests LOKELMA has radio - opaque properties and , therefore , may give the appearance typical of an imaging agent during abdominal X - ray procedures .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the label : • • Edema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Most common adverse reactions with LOKELMA : mild to moderate edema .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact AstraZeneca at 1 - 800 - 236 - 9933 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The total exposure to LOKELMA in the safety and efficacy clinical trials of patients not on dialysis with hyperkalemia was 1 , 760 patients with 652 patients exposed to LOKELMA for at least 6 months and 507 patients exposed for at least one year .
The population ( n = 1 , 009 ) in the placebo - controlled trials included patients aged 22 to 96 years , females ( n = 454 ) , Caucasians ( n = 859 ) and Blacks ( n = 130 ) .
Patients had hyperkalemia in association with comorbid diseases such as chronic kidney disease , heart failure , and diabetes mellitus .
In placebo - controlled trials in which patients who were not on dialysis were treated with once daily doses of LOKELMA for up to 28 days , edema was reported in 4 . 4 % of patients receiving 5 g , 5 . 9 % of patients receiving 10 g and 16 . 1 % of patients receiving 15 g LOKELMA compared to 2 . 4 % of patients receiving placebo .
In longer - term uncontrolled trials in which most patients were maintained on doses < 15 g once daily , adverse reactions of edema ( edema , generalized edema and peripheral edema ) were reported in 8 % to 11 % of patients .
Laboratory Abnormalities In clinical trials in patients who were not on dialysis , 4 . 1 % of LOKELMA - treated patients developed hypokalemia with a serum potassium value less than 3 . 5 mEq / L , which resolved with dosage reduction or discontinuation of LOKELMA .
In a clinical trial of LOKELMA in patients on chronic hemodialysis , 5 % of patients developed pre - dialysis hypokalemia ( serum potassium < 3 . 5 mEq / L ) in both the LOKELMA and placebo groups ; 3 % and 1 % of patients developed a serum potassium < 3 . 0 mEq / L in the LOKELMA and placebo groups , respectively .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS LOKELMA can transiently increase gastric pH . As a result , LOKELMA can change the absorption of co - administered drugs that exhibit pH - dependent solubility , potentially leading to altered efficacy or safety of these drugs when taken close to the time LOKELMA is administered .
In general , other oral medications should be administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after LOKELMA [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
LOKELMA is not expected to impact systemic exposure of drugs that do not exhibit pH - dependent solubility and so spacing is not needed if it has been determined that the concomitant medication does not exhibit pH - dependent solubility .
In general , other oral medications should be administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after LOKELMA .
( 2 . 3 , 7 , 12 . 3 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary LOKELMA is not absorbed systemically following oral administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary LOKELMA is not absorbed systemically following oral administration , and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to LOKELMA .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of LOKELMA , 58 % were age 65 and over , while 25 % were 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION LOKELMA is a powder for oral suspension .
The active ingredient in LOKELMA is sodium zirconium cyclosilicate , a potassium binder .
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is a non - absorbed zirconium silicate that preferentially exchanges potassium for hydrogen and sodium .
LOKELMA is an odorless , insoluble white to grey powder for oral suspension .
It has a mean particle size of 20 µm and includes no more than 3 % of particles with a diameter below 3 µm .
Each 5 g of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate contains 400 mg of sodium .
The chemical formula of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is Na ~ 1 . 5 H ~ 0 . 5ZrSi3O9 • 2 – 3H2O .
Figure 1 : Crystal Structure of Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action LOKELMA ( sodium zirconium cyclosilicate ) is a non - absorbed zirconium silicate that preferentially captures potassium in exchange for hydrogen and sodium .
In vitro , LOKELMA has a high affinity for potassium ions , even in the presence of other cations such as calcium and magnesium .
LOKELMA increases fecal potassium excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract .
Binding of potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the gastrointestinal lumen , thereby lowering serum potassium levels .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a study in healthy adult subjects , LOKELMA administered as 5 g or 10 g once daily for four days caused a dose - dependent increase in fecal potassium excretion .
Corresponding dose - dependent decreases in urinary potassium excretion and serum potassium were also observed .
In patients with hyperkalemia treated with LOKELMA 10 g three times a day for up to 48 hours , reductions in serum potassium were observed one hour after initiation of therapy ; serum potassium concentrations continued to decline over the 48 - hour treatment period [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
In patients not continuing LOKELMA , potassium levels increased .
Patients with higher starting serum potassium levels or receiving a higher dose have greater reductions in serum potassium .
LOKELMA causes a small dose - dependent increase in serum bicarbonate concentrations ( 1 . 1 mmol / L at 5 g once daily , 2 . 3 mmol / L at 10 g once daily and 2 . 6 mmol / L at 15 g once daily as compared with a mean increase of 0 . 6 mmol / L in patients treated with placebo ) .
The clinical significance of this finding is unclear .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics LOKELMA is an inorganic , insoluble compound that is not subject to enzymatic metabolism .
In a clinical study in patients with hyperkalemia in which zirconium concentrations were measured in the urine and blood , zirconium concentrations were similar in treated and untreated patients ( i . e . , either undetectable or around the lower limit of quantification of the assay ) .
An in vivo mass balance study in rats showed that LOKELMA was recovered in the feces with no evidence of systemic absorption .
Drug Interactions Thirty - six ( 36 ) drugs were tested in - vitro to determine potential interactions with LOKELMA .
Sixteen ( 16 ) drugs tested did not show an in vitro interaction with LOKELMA ( allopurinol , apixaban , aspirin , captopril , cyclosporine , digoxin , ethinyl estradiol , lisinopril , magnesium , metformin , phenytoin , prednisone , propranolol , quinapril , spironolactone and ticagrelor ) .
Nine ( 9 ) of the 20 drugs that showed an in vitro interaction were subsequently tested in vivo with LOKELMA 10 gin healthy volunteers .
Losartan , glipizide and levothyroxine did not show any changes in exposure when co - administered with LOKELMA .
However , there was an increase in systemic exposure to weak acids such as furosemide and atorvastatin , and a decrease in systemic exposure to weak bases such as dabigatran when co - administered with LOKELMA , as shown in Figure 2 .
These changes are consistent with the hypothesis that LOKELMA , by elevating gastric pH , affects the systemic exposure of co - administered drugs whose solubility is pH - dependent [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
In another drug - drug interaction study in healthy volunteers , co - administration of LOKELMA 15 g decreased the systemic exposures of tacrolimus ( Figure 2 ) , likely due to LOKELMA ’ s action on elevating gastric pH . In the same study , co - administration of LOKELMA and cyclosporine did not show a clinically meaningful interaction .
Figure 2 : Effects of LOKELMA 10 g or 15 g on the Pharmacokinetic Exposures of Other Orally Administered Medications [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The following tests for mutagenic potential of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate were negative : ( 1 ) the Ames ( S . typhimurium and E . coli ) test ; ( 2 ) chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells ; and ( 3 ) in vivo rat micronucleus assay .
Given that zirconium cyclosilicate is not genotoxic , not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract , and did not cause local gastrointestinal alterations in a chronic toxicity study in dogs , carcinogenicity studies in animals to evaluate tumorigenic potential of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate were not deemed to be necessary .
Fertility in male and female rats has been assessed at doses up to a Human Equivalent Dose ( HED ) of 58 g per day ( the maximum feasible dose ) with no adverse effects .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Study 1 The effectiveness of LOKELMA in lowering serum potassium was demonstrated in a two - part , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trial ( NCT01737697 ) in patients with hyperkalemia ( 5 to 6 . 5 mEq / L , mean potassium 5 . 3 mEq / L ) , Study 1 .
In the first phase of the trial ( the acute phase ) , 753 patients were randomized to receive one of four doses of LOKELMA ( 1 . 25 , 2 . 5 , 5 or 10 g ) or placebo , administered three times daily for the initial 48 hours with meals .
The mean age of patients was 66 years , 59 % of patients were men , and 86 % were Caucasian .
Approximately 60 % of patients had chronic kidney disease , 10 % had heart failure , 62 % had diabetes mellitus and 67 % were on renin angiotensin aldosterone system ( RAAS ) inhibitor therapy at baseline .
The primary endpoint in the acute phase was the difference in the exponential rate of change in serum potassium levels during the initial 48 hours of study drug treatment , comparing placebo - treated patients and LOKELMA - treated patients .
The study met its primary endpoint demonstrating a greater reduction in serum potassium levels for the 2 . 5 , 5 and 10 g ( three times a day ) dose groups compared to the placebo group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
As displayed in Table 1 for the secondary endpoint of potassium change from baseline , LOKELMA showed dose - dependent reductions in serum potassium at 2 . 5 , 5 and 10 g .
In patients administered 10 g TID , the mean serum potassium reduction was - 0 . 7 mEq / L at 48 hours .
Patients with higher starting potassium levels had a greater response to LOKELMA .
LOKELMA was effective in lowering potassium levels in patients with chronic kidney disease , heart failure , diabetes mellitus and those taking RAAS inhibitor therapy .

The primary endpoint in the maintenance phase was the difference in the exponential rate of change in serum potassium levels over the 12 - day treatment interval , comparing patients receiving LOKELMA and patients receiving placebo .
The study met the primary efficacy endpoint at the 5 and 10 g doses when compared with their respective placebo groups ( p < 0 . 01 and p < 0 . 001 ) .
14 . 2 Study 2 The efficacy of LOKELMA was also demonstrated in a two - part trial with an open - label acute phase and a month - long randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled withdrawal phase ( Study 2 ; NCT02088073 ) .
In the open - label acute phase of Study 2 , 258 patients with hyperkalemia ( baseline mean 5 . 6 mEq / L , range 5 . 1 to 7 . 4 mEq / L ) received 10 g of LOKELMA administered three times daily with meals for 48 hours .
As shown in Figure 3 , left , average serum potassium levels decreased from 5 . 6 to 4 . 5 mEq / L during treatment with LOKELMA in the acute phase .
Following the acute phase of the study , there was a double - blind randomized withdrawal phase where patients who achieved potassium levels between 3 . 5 and 5 mEq / L were randomized to one of three doses of LOKELMA administered once - daily for 28 days , or placebo just before breakfast .
Of the patients enrolled in the acute phase , 92 % achieved a potassium level within this range and were enrolled into the second phase of the trial .
The primary endpoint in the randomized withdrawal phase was the mean serum potassium value over the period from Day 8 to Day 29 , comparing LOKELMA - treated and placebo - treated patients .
All three doses ( 5 , 10 and 15 g ) of once daily LOKELMA maintained mean potassium at lower levels than placebo ( mean serum potassium was 4 . 8 , 4 . 5 , and 4 . 4 mEq / L for the 5 , 10 and 15 g dose groups , respectively , vs . 5 . 1 mEq / L in the placebo group , p ≤ 0 . 001 for all doses , Figure 3 , right ) .
A greater proportion of patients had mean serum potassium levels in the normal range ( 3 . 5 to 5 mEq / L ) while on LOKELMA than while on placebo ( 80 % , 90 % and 94 % at the 5 , 10 and 15 g doses , respectively , vs . 46 % on placebo ) .
Figure 3 : Study 2 - Mean Serum Potassium Levels in the Acute and Randomized Withdrawal Phases [ MULTIMEDIA ] Intent - to - Treat population includes subjects with at least one valid serum potassium measurement on or after Day 8 [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Eleven - Month Extension Study Patients who completed the 28 - day randomized withdrawal phase had the option to continue treatment with LOKELMA , taken just before breakfast , in an open - label extension phase for up to 11 months ( n = 123 ; NCT02107092 ) .
Figure 4 shows that the treatment effect on serum potassium was maintained during continued therapy .
Figure 4 : 11 - Month Open - Label Extension Phase of Study 2 - Mean Serum Potassium ( mEq / L ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 4 Study 3 LOKELMA was evaluated in an open - label 12 - month study in 751 hyperkalemic patients ( NCT02163499 ) .
The mean baseline potassium level in this study was 5 . 6 mEq / L .
Following the acute phase treatment of LOKELMA 10 g three times a day , patients who achieved normokalemia ( 3 . 5 - 5 . 0 mEq / L ) within 72 hours ( n = 746 ; 99 % ) entered the maintenance phase .
For maintenance treatment , the initial dosage of LOKELMA was 5 g once daily and was adjusted to a minimum of 5 g every other day up to maximum of 15 g once daily , based on serum potassium level .
The treatment effect on serum potassium was maintained during continued therapy .
14 . 5 Study 4 The effectiveness of LOKELMA in lowering serum potassium was studied in a double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of 196 chronic hemodialysis patients ( mean age 58 years , range 20 to 86 years ) with persistent pre - dialysis hyperkalemia ( mean baseline potassium 5 . 8 mEq / L ) who were randomized to receive LOKELMA 5 g or placebo once daily on non - dialysis days ( NCT03303521 ) .
During the dose adjustment period ( initial 4 weeks ) , the dose was adjusted weekly in 5 g increments up to 15 g once daily based on pre - dialysis serum potassium measurement after the long inter - dialytic interval to achieve a pre - dialysis serum potassium level between 4 . 0 - 5 . 0 mEq / L .
The dose reached at the end of the dose - adjustment period was maintained throughout the subsequent 4 - week evaluation period .
The primary endpoint in the trial was the proportion of responders , defined as patients who maintained a pre - dialysis serum potassium between 4 . 0 and 5 . 0 mEq / L on at least 3 out of 4 dialysis treatments after the long inter - dialytic interval and who did not receive rescue therapy during the evaluation period .
A greater proportion of patients were responders in the LOKELMA arm as compared to placebo ( 41 % vs 1 % , respectively ; p < 0 . 001 ) .
The treatment effect on mean pre - dialysis serum potassium levels was maintained during continued treatment .
Mean pre - dialysis serum potassium levels during the study are presented in Figure 5 .
