( 5 . 11 ) 5 . 1 Drug Interactions See Table 1 for listings of drugs that are contraindicated due to potentially life - threatening adverse events , significant drug interactions , or due to loss of virologic activity [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Skin Reactions Severe and life - threatening skin reactions , including 1 case of Stevens - Johnson syndrome among 700 patients treated with LEXIVA in clinical studies .
Treatment with LEXIVA should be discontinued for severe or life - threatening rashes and for moderate rashes accompanied by systemic symptoms [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
5 . 3 Sulfa Allergy LEXIVA should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy .
Fosamprenavir contains a sulfonamide moiety .
The potential for cross - sensitivity between drugs in the sulfonamide class and fosamprenavir is unknown .
In a clinical study of LEXIVA used as the sole protease inhibitor , rash occurred in 2 of 10 patients ( 20 % ) with a history of sulfonamide allergy compared with 42 of 126 patients ( 33 % ) with no history of sulfonamide allergy .
In 2 clinical studies of LEXIVA plus low - dose ritonavir , rash occurred in 8 of 50 patients ( 16 % ) with a history of sulfonamide allergy compared with 50 of 412 patients ( 12 % ) with no history of sulfonamide allergy .
5 . 4 Hepatic Toxicity Use of LEXIVA with ritonavir at higher - than - recommended dosages may result in transaminase elevations and should not be used [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for developing or worsening of transaminase elevations .
Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with LEXIVA and patients should be monitored closely during treatment .
5 . 5 Diabetes / Hyperglycemia New onset diabetes mellitus , exacerbation of pre - existing diabetes mellitus , and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV - infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy .
Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events .
In some cases , diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred .
In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy , hyperglycemia persisted in some cases .
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between protease inhibitor therapy and these events have not been established .
5 . 6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including LEXIVA .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [ PCP ] , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
5 . 7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution / accumulation of body fat , including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( buffalo hump ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and “ cushingoid appearance , ” have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy , including LEXIVA .
The mechanism and long - term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
A causal relationship has not been established .
5 . 8 Lipid Elevations Treatment with LEXIVA plus ritonavir has resulted in increases in the concentration of triglycerides and cholesterol [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating therapy with LEXIVA and at periodic intervals during therapy .
Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 9 Hemolytic Anemia Acute hemolytic anemia has been reported in a patient treated with amprenavir .
5 . 10 Patients With Hemophilia There have been reports of spontaneous bleeding in patients with hemophilia A and B treated with protease inhibitors .
In some patients , additional factor VIII was required .
In many of the reported cases , treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or restarted .
A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these episodes has not been established .
5 . 11 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV - infected patients receiving LEXIVA . Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis occur , temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered .
5 . 12 Resistance / Cross - Resistance Because the potential for HIV cross - resistance among protease inhibitors has not been fully explored , it is unknown what effect therapy with LEXIVA will have on the activity of subsequently administered protease inhibitors .
LEXIVA has been studied in patients who have experienced treatment failure with protease inhibitors [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS • Severe or life - threatening skin reactions have been reported with the use of LEXIVA [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• The most common moderate to severe adverse reactions in clinical studies of LEXIVA were diarrhea , rash , nausea , vomiting , and headache .
• Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 6 . 4 % of patients receiving LEXIVA and in 5 . 9 % of patients receiving comparator treatments .
The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of LEXIVA ( incidence ≤ 1 % of patients ) included diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , AST increased , ALT increased , and rash .
• In adults the most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 4 % ) are diarrhea , rash , nausea , vomiting , headache .
( 6 . 1 ) • Vomiting was more frequent in pediatrics than in adults .

Pediatric Patients : LEXIVA with and without ritonavir was studied in 144 pediatric patients 2 to 18 years of age in 2 open - label studies .
Safety information from 75 pediatric patients receiving LEXIVA twice daily with or without ritonavir follows .
All adverse events regardless of causality , all drug - related adverse events , and all laboratory events occurred with similar frequency in pediatrics compared with adults , with the exception of vomiting .
Vomiting , regardless of causality , occurred more frequently among pediatric patients receiving LEXIVA twice daily with ritonavir ( [ 30 % ] all between 2 and 18 years of age ) and without ritonavir ( [ 56 % ] all between 2 and 5 years of age ) compared with adults receiving LEXIVA twice daily with ritonavir ( 10 % ) and without ritonavir ( 16 % ) .
The median duration of drug - related vomiting episodes was 1 day ( range : 1 to 62 days ) .
Vomiting required temporary dose interruptions in 4 pediatric patients and was treatment - limiting in 1 pediatric patient , all of whom were receiving LEXIVA twice daily with ritonavir .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials , the following reactions have been identified during post - approval use of LEXIVA .
Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness , frequency of reporting , or potential causal connection to LEXIVA .
Cardiac Disorders Myocardial infarction .
Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Hypercholesterolemia .
Nervous System Disorders Oral paresthesia .
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Angioedema .
Urogenital Nephrolithiasis .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See also Contraindications ( 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) .
If LEXIVA is used in combination with ritonavir , see full prescribing information for ritonavir for additional information on drug interactions .
• Coadministration of LEXIVA with drugs that induce CYP3A4 may decrease amprenavir ( active metabolite ) concentrations leading to potential loss of virologic activity .
( 7 , 12 . 3 ) • Coadministration with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase amprenavir concentrations .
( 7 , 12 . 3 ) • Coadministration of LEXIVA and ritonavir may result in clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 .
( 7 ) 7 . 1 CYP Inhibitors and Inducers Amprenavir , the active metabolite of fosamprenavir , is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 metabolism and therefore should not be administered concurrently with medications with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of CYP3A4 .
Data also suggest that amprenavir induces CYP3A4 .
Amprenavir is metabolized by CYP3A4 .
Coadministration of LEXIVA and drugs that induce CYP3A4 , such as rifampin , may decrease amprenavir concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect .
Coadministration of LEXIVA and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase amprenavir concentrations and increase the incidence of adverse effects .
The potential for drug interactions with LEXIVA changes when LEXIVA is coadministered with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir .
The magnitude of CYP3A4 - mediated drug interactions ( effect on amprenavir or effect on coadministered drug ) may change when LEXIVA is coadministered with ritonavir .
Because ritonavir is a CYP2D6 inhibitor , clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 are possible when coadministered with LEXIVA plus ritonavir .
There are other agents that may result in serious and / or life - threatening drug interactions [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
7 . 2 Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With LEXIVA See Contraindications ( 4 ) .
7 . 3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C . Embryo / fetal development studies were conducted in rats ( dosed from day 6 to day 17 of gestation ) and rabbits ( dosed from day 7 to day 20 of gestation ) .
Administration of fosamprenavir to pregnant rats and rabbits produced no major effects on embryo - fetal development ; however , the incidence of abortion was increased in rabbits that were administered fosamprenavir .
Systemic exposures ( AUC0 - 24 hr ) to amprenavir at these dosages were 0 . 8 ( rabbits ) to 2 ( rats ) times the exposures in humans following administration of the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of fosamprenavir alone or 0 . 3 ( rabbits ) to 0 . 7 ( rats ) times the exposures in humans following administration of the MRHD of fosamprenavir in combination with ritonavir .
In contrast , administration of amprenavir was associated with abortions and an increased incidence of minor skeletal variations resulting from deficient ossification of the femur , humerus , and trochlea , in pregnant rabbits at the tested dose ; approximately one - twentieth the exposure seen at the recommended human dose .
The mating and fertility of the F1 generation born to female rats given fosamprenavir was not different from control animals ; however , fosamprenavir did cause a reduction in both pup survival and body weights .
Surviving F1 female rats showed an increased time to successful mating , an increased length of gestation , a reduced number of uterine implantation sites per litter , and reduced gestational body weights compared with control animals .
Systemic exposure ( AUC0 - 24 hr ) to amprenavir in the F0 pregnant rats was approximately 2 times higher than exposures in humans following administration of the MRHD of fosamprenavir alone or approximately the same as those seen in humans following administration of the MRHD of fosamprenavir in combination with ritonavir .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
LEXIVA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry To monitor maternal - fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to LEXIVA , an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established .
Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV .
Although it is not known if amprenavir is excreted in human milk , amprenavir is secreted into the milk of lactating rats .
Because of both the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving LEXIVA .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety , pharmacokinetic profile , and virologic response of LEXIVA Oral Suspension and Tablets were evaluated in pediatric patients 2 to 18 years of age in 2 open - label studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
No data are available for pediatric patients < 2 years of age .
The adverse reaction profile seen in pediatrics was similar to that seen in adults .
Vomiting , regardless of causality , was more frequent in pediatrics than in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of LEXIVA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Amprenavir is principally metabolized by the liver ; therefore , caution should be exercised when administering LEXIVA to patients with hepatic impairment because amprenavir concentrations may be increased [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients with impaired hepatic function receiving LEXIVA with or without concurrent ritonavir require dose reduction [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In a healthy volunteer repeat - dose pharmacokinetic study evaluating high - dose combinations of LEXIVA plus ritonavir , an increased frequency of Grade 2 / 3 ALT elevations ( > 2 . 5 x ULN ) was observed with LEXIVA 1 , 400 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 200 mg twice daily ( 4 of 25 subjects ) .
Concurrent Grade 1 / 2 elevations in AST ( > 1 . 25 x ULN ) were noted in 3 of these 4 subjects .
These transaminase elevations resolved following discontinuation of dosing .
There is no known antidote for LEXIVA .
It is not known whether amprenavir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis .
If overdosage occurs , the patient should be monitored for evidence of toxicity and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary .
11 DESCRIPTION LEXIVA ( fosamprenavir calcium ) is a prodrug of amprenavir , an inhibitor of HIV protease .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Fosamprenavir is an antiviral agent [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of amprenavir after administration of LEXIVA , with or without ritonavir , have been evaluated in both healthy adult volunteers and in HIV - infected patients ; no substantial differences in steady - state amprenavir concentrations were observed between the 2 populations .
The pharmacokinetic parameters of amprenavir after administration of LEXIVA ( with and without concomitant ritonavir ) are shown in Table 7 .
Table 7 .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Absorption and Bioavailability After administration of a single dose of LEXIVA to HIV - 1 - infected patients , the time to peak amprenavir concentration ( Tmax ) occurred between 1 . 5 and 4 hours ( median 2 . 5 hours ) .
The absolute oral bioavailability of amprenavir after administration of LEXIVA in humans has not been established .
After administration of a single 1 , 400 - mg dose in the fasted state , LEXIVA Oral Suspension ( 50 mg / mL ) and LEXIVA Tablets ( 700 mg ) provided similar amprenavir exposures ( AUC ) , however , the Cmax of amprenavir after administration of the suspension formulation was 14 . 5 % higher compared with the tablet .
Effects of Food on Oral Absorption Administration of a single 1 , 400 - mg dose of LEXIVA Tablets in the fed state ( standardized high - fat meal : 967 kcal , 67 grams fat , 33 grams protein , 58 grams carbohydrate ) compared with the fasted state was associated with no significant changes in amprenavir Cmax , Tmax , or AUC0 - ∞ [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Administration of a single 1 , 400 - mg dose of LEXIVA Oral Suspension in the fed state ( standardized high - fat meal : 967 kcal , 67 grams fat , 33 grams protein , 58 grams carbohydrate ) compared with the fasted state was associated with a 46 % reduction in Cmax , a 0 . 72 - hour delay in Tmax , and a 28 % reduction in amprenavir AUC0 - ∞ .
Distribution In vitro , amprenavir is approximately 90 % bound to plasma proteins , primarily to alpha1 - acid glycoprotein .
In vitro , concentration - dependent binding was observed over the concentration range of 1 to 10 mcg / mL , with decreased binding at higher concentrations .
The partitioning of amprenavir into erythrocytes is low , but increases as amprenavir concentrations increase , reflecting the higher amount of unbound drug at higher concentrations .
Metabolism After oral administration , fosamprenavir is rapidly and almost completely hydrolyzed to amprenavir and inorganic phosphate prior to reaching the systemic circulation .
This occurs in the gut epithelium during absorption .
Amprenavir is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) enzyme system .
The 2 major metabolites result from oxidation of the tetrahydrofuran and aniline moieties .
Glucuronide conjugates of oxidized metabolites have been identified as minor metabolites in urine and feces .
Elimination Excretion of unchanged amprenavir in urine and feces is minimal .
Unchanged amprenavir in urine accounts for approximately 1 % of the dose ; unchanged amprenavir was not detectable in feces .
Approximately 14 % and 75 % of an administered single dose of 14 C - amprenavir can be accounted for as metabolites in urine and feces , respectively .
Two metabolites accounted for > 90 % of the radiocarbon in fecal samples .
The plasma elimination half - life of amprenavir is approximately 7 . 7 hours .
Special Populations Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of amprenavir have been studied after the administration of LEXIVA in combination with ritonavir to adult HIV - 1 - infected patients with mild , moderate , and severe hepatic impairment .
Following 2 weeks of dosing with LEXIVA plus ritonavir , the AUC of amprenavir was increased by approximately 22 % in patients with mild hepatic impairment , by approximately 70 % in patients with moderate hepatic impairment , and by approximately 80 % in patients with severe hepatic impairment compared with HIV - 1 - infected patients with normal hepatic function .
Protein binding of amprenavir was decreased in patients with hepatic impairment .
The unbound fraction at 2 hours ( approximate Cmax ) ranged between a decrease of - 7 % to an increase of 57 % while the unbound fraction at the end of the dosing interval ( Cmin ) increased from 50 % to 102 % [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of amprenavir have been studied after administration of amprenavir given as AGENERASE ® Capsules to adult patients with hepatic impairment .
Following administration of a single 600 - mg oral dose the AUC of amprenavir was increased by approximately 2 . 5 - fold in patients with moderate cirrhosis and by approximately 4 . 5 - fold in patients with severe cirrhosis compared with healthy volunteers [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Renal Impairment The impact of renal impairment on amprenavir elimination in adult patients has not been studied .
The renal elimination of unchanged amprenavir represents approximately 1 % of the administered dose ; therefore , renal impairment is not expected to significantly impact the elimination of amprenavir .
Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of amprenavir after administration of LEXIVA Oral Suspension and LEXIVA Tablets , with or without ritonavir , have been evaluated in 124 patients 2 to 18 years of age .
Pharmacokinetic parameters for LEXIVA administered with food and with or without ritonavir in this patient population are provided in Tables 8 and 9 below .

Drug Interactions [ See Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) . ]
Amprenavir , the active metabolite of fosamprenavir , is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system .
Amprenavir inhibits CYP3A4 .
Data also suggest that amprenavir induces CYP3A4 .
Caution should be used when coadministering medications that are substrates , inhibitors , or inducers of CYP3A4 , or potentially toxic medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4 .
Amprenavir does not inhibit CYP2D6 , CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2E1 , or uridine glucuronosyltransferase ( UDPGT ) .
Drug interaction studies were performed with LEXIVA and other drugs likely to be coadministered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions .
The effects of coadministration on AUC , Cmax , and Cmin values are summarized in Table 10 ( effect of other drugs on amprenavir ) and Table 12 ( effect of LEXIVA on other drugs ) .
In addition , since LEXIVA delivers comparable amprenavir plasma concentrations as AGENERASE , drug interaction data derived from studies with AGENERASE are provided in Tables 11 and 13 .

12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Fosamprenavir is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed to amprenavir by cellular phosphatases in the gut epithelium as it is absorbed .
Amprenavir is an inhibitor of HIV - 1 protease .
Amprenavir binds to the active site of HIV - 1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag and Gag - Pol polyprotein precursors , resulting in the formation of immature non - infectious viral particles .
Antiviral Activity Fosamprenavir has little or no antiviral activity in vitro .
The in vitro antiviral activity of amprenavir was evaluated against HIV - 1 IIIB in both acutely and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines ( MT - 4 , CEM - CCRF , H9 ) and in peripheral blood lymphocytes .
The 50 % effective concentration ( EC50 ) of amprenavir ranged from 0 . 012 to 0 . 08 μM in acutely infected cells and was 0 . 41 μM in chronically infected cells ( 1 μM = 0 . 50 mcg / mL ) .
The median EC50 value of amprenavir against HIV - 1 isolates from clades A to G was 0 . 00095 µM in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) .
Similarly , the EC50 values for amprenavir against monocytes / macrophage tropic HIV - 1 isolates ( clade B ) ranged from 0 . 003 to 0 . 075 µM in monocyte / macrophage cultures .
The EC50 values of amprenavir against HIV - 2 isolates grown in PBMCs were higher than those for HIV - 1 isolates , and ranged from 0 . 003 to 0 . 11 µM .
Amprenavir exhibited synergistic anti – HIV - 1 activity in combination with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) abacavir , didanosine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , and zidovudine ; the non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) delavirdine and efavirenz ; and the protease inhibitors atazanavir and saquinavir .
Amprenavir exhibited additive anti – HIV - 1 activity in combination with the NNRTI nevirapine , the protease inhibitors indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , and ritonavir ; and the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide .
These drug combinations have not been adequately studied in humans .
Resistance HIV - 1 isolates with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir have been selected in vitro and obtained from patients treated with fosamprenavir .
Genotypic analysis of isolates from treatment - naive patients failing amprenavir - containing regimens showed mutations in the HIV - 1 protease gene resulting in amino acid substitutions primarily at positions V32I , M46I / L , I47V , I50V , I54L / M , and I84V , as well as mutations in the p7 / p1 and p1 / p6 Gag and Gag - Pol polyprotein precursor cleavage sites .
Some of these amprenavir resistance - associated mutations have also been detected in HIV - 1 isolates from antiretroviral - naive patients treated with LEXIVA .
Of the 488 antiretroviral - naive patients treated with LEXIVA 1 , 400 mg twice daily or LEXIVA 1 , 400 mg plus ritonavir 200 mg once daily in studies APV30001 and APV30002 , respectively , 61 patients ( 29 receiving LEXIVA and 32 receiving LEXIVA / ritonavir ) with virologic failure ( plasma HIV - 1 RNA > 1 , 000 copies / mL on 2 occasions on or after Week 12 ) were genotyped .
Five of the 29 antiretroviral - naive patients ( 17 % ) receiving LEXIVA without ritonavir in study APV30001 had evidence of genotypic resistance to amprenavir : I54L / M ( n = 2 ) , I54L + L33F ( n = 1 ) , V32I + I47V ( n = 1 ) , and M46I + I47V ( n = 1 ) .
No amprenavir resistance - associated mutations were detected in antiretroviral - naive patients treated with LEXIVA / ritonavir for 48 weeks in study APV30002 .
However , the M46I and I50V mutations were detected in isolates from 1 virologic failure patient receiving LEXIVA / ritonavir once daily at Week 160 ( HIV - 1 RNA > 500 copies / mL ) .
Upon retrospective analysis of stored samples using an ultrasensitive assay , these resistant mutants were traced back to Week 84 ( 76 weeks prior to clinical virologic failure ) .
Cross - Resistance Varying degrees of cross - resistance among HIV - 1 protease inhibitors have been observed .
An association between virologic response at 48 weeks ( HIV - 1 RNA level < 400 copies / mL ) and protease inhibitor - resistance mutations detected in baseline HIV - 1 isolates from protease inhibitor - experienced patients receiving LEXIVA / ritonavir twice daily ( n = 88 ) , or lopinavir / ritonavir twice daily ( n = 85 ) in study APV30003 is shown in Table 14 .
The majority of subjects had previously received either one ( 47 % ) or 2 protease inhibitors ( 36 % ) , most commonly nelfinavir ( 57 % ) and indinavir ( 53 % ) .
Out of 102 subjects with baseline phenotypes receiving twice - daily LEXIVA / ritonavir , 54 % ( n = 55 ) had resistance to at least one protease inhibitor , with 98 % ( n = 54 ) of those having resistance to nelfinavir .
Out of 97 subjects with baseline phenotypes in the lopinavir / ritonavir arm , 60 % ( n = 58 ) had resistance to at least one protease inhibitor , with 97 % ( n = 56 ) of those having resistance to nelfinavir .

Baseline isolates from protease inhibitor - experienced patients responding to LEXIVA / ritonavir twice daily had a median shift in susceptibility to amprenavir relative to a standard wild - type reference strain of 0 . 7 ( range : 0 . 1 to 5 . 4 , n = 62 ) , and baseline isolates from individuals failing therapy had a median shift in susceptibility of 1 . 9 ( range : 0 . 2 to 14 , n = 29 ) .
Because this was a select patient population , these data do not constitute definitive clinical susceptibility break points .
Additional data are needed to determine clinically relevant break points for LEXIVA .
Isolates from 15 of the 20 patients receiving twice - daily LEXIVA / ritonavir up to Week 48 and experiencing virologic failure / ongoing replication were subjected to genotypic analysis .
The following amprenavir resistance - associated mutations were found either alone or in combination : V32I , M46I / L , I47V , I50V , I54L / M , and I84V .
Isolates from 4 of the 16 patients continuing to receive twice - daily LEXIVA / ritonavir up to Week 96 who experienced virologic failure underwent genotypic analysis .
Isolates from 2 patients contained amprenavir resistance - associated mutations : V32I , M46I , and I47V in 1 isolate and I84V in the other .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In long - term carcinogenicity studies , fosamprenavir was administered orally for up to 104 weeks at doses of 250 , 400 , or 600 mg / kg / day in mice and at doses of 300 , 825 , or 2 , 250 mg / kg / day in rats .
Exposures at these doses were 0 . 3 - to 0 . 7 - fold ( mice ) and 0 . 7 - to 1 . 4 - fold ( rats ) those in humans given 1 , 400 mg twice daily of fosamprenavir alone , and 0 . 2 - to 0 . 3 - fold ( mice ) and 0 . 3 - to 0 . 7 - fold ( rats ) those in humans given 1 , 400 mg once daily of fosamprenavir plus 200 mg ritonavir once daily .
Exposures in the carcinogenicity studies were 0 . 1 - to 0 . 3 - fold ( mice ) and 0 . 3 - to 0 . 6 - fold ( rats ) those in humans given 700 mg of fosamprenavir plus 100 mg ritonavir twice daily .
There was an increase in hepatocellular adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas at all doses in male mice and at 600 mg / kg / day in female mice , and in hepatocellular adenomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas at all doses in male rats , and at 835 mg / kg / day and 2 , 250 mg / kg / day in female rats .
The relevance of the hepatocellular findings in the rodents for humans is uncertain .
Repeat dose studies with fosamprenavir in rats produced effects consistent with enzyme induction , which predisposes rats , but not humans , to thyroid neoplasms .
In addition , in rats only there was an increase in interstitial cell hyperplasia at 825 mg / kg / day and 2 , 250 mg / kg / day , and an increase in uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma at 2 , 250 mg / kg / day .
The incidence of endometrial findings was slightly increased over concurrent controls , but was within background range for female rats .
The relevance of the uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma findings in rats for humans is uncertain .
Fosamprenavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays .
These assays included bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) , mouse lymphoma , rat micronucleus , and chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes .
The effects of fosamprenavir on fertility and general reproductive performance were investigated in male ( treated for 4 weeks before mating ) and female rats ( treated for 2 weeks before mating through postpartum day 6 ) .
Systemic exposures ( AUC0 - 24 hr ) to amprenavir in these studies were 3 ( males ) to 4 ( females ) times higher than exposures in humans following administration of the MRHD of fosamprenavir alone or similar to those seen in humans following administration of fosamprenavir in combination with ritonavir .
Fosamprenavir did not impair mating or fertility of male or female rats and did not affect the development and maturation of sperm from treated rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Therapy - Naive Adult Patients Study APV30001 APV30001 was a randomized , open - label study , comparing treatment with LEXIVA Tablets ( 1 , 400 mg twice daily ) versus nelfinavir ( 1 , 250 mg twice daily ) in 249 antiretroviral treatment - naive patients .

14 . 2 Protease Inhibitor - Experienced Adult Patients Study APV30003 APV30003 was a randomized , open - label , multicenter study comparing 2 different regimens of LEXIVA plus ritonavir ( LEXIVA Tablets 700 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily or LEXIVA Tablets 1 , 400 mg once daily plus ritonavir 200 mg once daily ) versus lopinavir / ritonavir ( 400 mg / 100 mg twice daily ) in 315 patients who had experienced virologic failure to 1 or 2 prior protease inhibitor - containing regimens .
The mean age of the patients in this study was 42 years ( range : 24 to 72 years ) , 85 % were male , 33 % were CDC Class C , 67 % were Caucasian , 24 % were black , and 9 % were Hispanic .
The median CD4 + cell count at baseline was 263 cells / mm3 ( range : 2 to 1 , 171 cells / mm3 ) .
Baseline median plasma HIV - 1 RNA level was 4 . 14 log10 copies / mL ( range : 1 . 69 to 6 . 41 log10 copies / mL ) .
The median durations of prior exposure to NRTIs were 257 weeks for patients receiving LEXIVA / ritonavir twice daily ( 79 % had ≥ 3 prior NRTIs ) and 210 weeks for patients receiving lopinavir / ritonavir ( 64 % had ≥ 3 prior NRTIs ) .
The median durations of prior exposure to protease inhibitors were 149 weeks for patients receiving LEXIVA / ritonavir twice daily ( 49 % received ≥ 2 prior protease inhibitors ) and 130 weeks for patients receiving lopinavir / ritonavir ( 40 % received ≥ 2 prior protease inhibitors ) .
The time - averaged changes in plasma HIV - 1 RNA from baseline ( AAUCMB ) at 48 weeks ( the endpoint on which the study was powered ) were - 1 . 4 log10 copies / mL for twice - daily LEXIVA / ritonavir and - 1 . 67 log10 copies / mL for the lopinavir / ritonavir group .
The proportions of patients who achieved and maintained confirmed HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL ( secondary efficacy endpoint ) were 58 % with twice - daily LEXIVA / ritonavir and 61 % with lopinavir / ritonavir ( 95 % CI for the difference : - 16 . 6 , 10 . 1 ) .
The proportions of patients with HIV - 1 RNA < 50 copies / mL with twice - daily LEXIVA / ritonavir and with lopinavir / ritonavir were 46 % and 50 % , respectively ( 95 % CI for the difference : - 18 . 3 , 8 . 9 ) .
The proportions of patients who were virologic failures were 29 % with twice - daily LEXIVA / ritonavir and 27 % with lopinavir / ritonavir .
The frequency of discontinuations due to adverse events and other reasons , and deaths were similar between treatment arms .
Through 48 weeks of therapy , the median increases from baseline in CD4 + cell counts were 81 cells / mm3 with twice - daily LEXIVA / ritonavir and 91 cells / mm3 with lopinavir / ritonavir .
