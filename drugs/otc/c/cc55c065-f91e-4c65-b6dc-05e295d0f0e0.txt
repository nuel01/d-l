( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS LOSEASONIQUE is contraindicated in females who are known to have or develop the following conditions : • A high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases .
Examples include females who are known to : • Smoke , if over age 35 [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Have current or history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Have cerebrovascular disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Have coronary artery disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Have thrombogenic valvular or thrombogenic rhythm diseases of the heart ( for example , subacute bacterial endocarditis with valvular disease , or atrial fibrillation ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Have inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathies [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Have uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Have diabetes mellitus and are over age 35 , diabetes mellitus with hypertension or with vascular disease or other end - organ damage , or diabetes mellitus of > 20 years duration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • Have headaches with focal neurological symptoms , migraine headaches with aura , or over age 35 with any migraine headaches [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] • Current diagnosis of , or history of , breast cancer , which may be hormone sensitive [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] • Liver tumors , acute viral hepatitis , or severe ( decompensated ) cirrhosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] • Use of Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , due to the potential for ALT elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
• A high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases ( 4 ) • Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding ( 4 ) • Breast cancer ( 4 ) • Liver tumors or liver disease , acute viral hepatitis or decompensated cirrhosis ( 4 ) • Co - administration with Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks : Stop if a thrombotic or thromboembolic event occurs .
Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery .
Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery , in women who are not breastfeeding .
Consider cardiovascular risk factors before initiating in all females , particularly those over 35 years .
( 5 . 1 , 5 . 5 ) • Liver disease : Discontinue if jaundice occurs .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypertension : If used in females with well - controlled hypertension , monitor blood pressure and stop if blood pressure rises significantly .
( 5 . 3 ) • Gallbladder disease : May cause or worsen gallbladder disease .
( 5 . 6 ) • Adverse carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects : Monitor glucose in prediabetic and diabetic women taking LOSEASONIQUE .
Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias .
( 5 . 7 ) • Headache : Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue if indicated .
( 5 . 8 ) • Uterine bleeding : May cause irregular bleeding or amenorrhea .
Evaluate for other causes if symptoms persist .
( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Conditions • Stop LOSEASONIQUE if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic / thromboembolic event occurs .
• Stop LOSEASONIQUE if there is unexplained loss of vision , proptosis , diplopia , papilledema , or retinal vascular lesions and evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately .
• Discontinue LOSEASONIQUE during prolonged immobilization .
If feasible , stop LOSEASONIQUE at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery , or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism .
• Start LOSEASONIQUE no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery , in females who are not breastfeeding .
The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week , whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week .
• Before starting LOSEASONIQUE evaluate any past medical history or family history of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders and consider whether the history suggests an inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathy .
LOSEASONIQUE is contraindicated in females with a high risk of arterial or venous / thromboembolic diseases [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Arterial Events COCs increase the risk of cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events , such as myocardial infarction and stroke .
The risk is greater among older women ( > 35 years of age ) , smokers , and females with hypertension , dyslipidemia , diabetes , or obesity .
LOSEASONIQUE is contraindicated in women over 35 years of age who smoke [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use .
This risk increases with age , particularly in women over 35 years of age , and with the number of cigarettes smoked .
Venous Events Use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events ( VTEs ) , such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism .
Risk factors for VTEs include smoking , obesity , and family history of VTE , in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
While the increased risk of VTE associated with use of COCs is well - established , the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy , and especially during the postpartum period ( see Figure 1 ) .
The rate of VTE in females using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 cases per 10 , 000 woman years .
The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of four weeks or longer .
The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued .
Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives , for females who use oral contraceptives , and for females in the postpartum period .
To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective : If 10 , 000 females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year , between 1 and 5 of these females will develop a VTE .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Use of LOSEASONIQUE provides females with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins ( an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen , respectively , per year ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 5 . 2 Liver Disease Elevated Liver Enzymes LOSEASONIQUE is contraindicated in females with acute viral hepatitis or severe ( decompensated ) cirrhosis of the liver [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Acute liver test abnormalities may necessitate the discontinuation of LOSEASONIQUE until the liver tests return to normal and LOSEASONIQUE causation has been excluded .
Discontinue LOSEASONIQUE if jaundice develops .
Liver Tumors LOSEASONIQUE is contraindicated in females with benign or malignant liver tumors [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
COCs increase the risk of hepatic adenomas .
An estimate of the attributable risk is 3 . 3 cases / 100 , 000 COC users .
Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death from abdominal hemorrhage .
Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long - term ( > 8 years ) COC users .
The attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users .
5 . 3 Hypertension LOSEASONIQUE is contraindicated in females with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
For all females , including those with well - controlled hypertension , monitor blood pressure at routine visits and stop LOSEASONIQUE if blood pressure rises significantly .
An increase in blood pressure has been reported in females taking COCs , and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use .
The effect of COCs on blood pressure may vary according to the progestin in the COC .
5 . 4 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN , were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol - containing medications , such as COCs .
Discontinue LOSEASONIQUE prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
LOSEASONIQUE can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen .
5 . 5 Age - related Considerations The risk for cardiovascular disease and prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease increases with age .
Certain conditions , such as smoking and migraine headache without aura , that do not contraindicate COC use in younger females , are contraindications to use in women over 35 years of age [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Consider the presence of underlying risk factors that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or VTE , particularly before initiating a COC for women over 35 years , such as : • Hypertension • Diabetes • Dyslipidemia • Obesity 5 . 6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users .
Use of COCs , including LOSEASONIQUE , may also worsen existing gallbladder disease .
A past history of COC - related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use .
Females with a history of pregnancy - related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC - related cholestasis .
5 . 7 Adverse Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Hyperglycemia LOSEASONIQUE is contraindicated in diabetic women over age 35 , or females who have diabetes with hypertension , nephropathy , retinopathy , neuropathy , other vascular disease , or females with diabetes of > 20 years duration [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
LOSEASONIQUE may decrease glucose tolerance .
Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic females who are taking COCs .
Dyslipidemia Consider alternative contraception for females with uncontrolled dyslipidemias .
LOSEASONIQUE may cause adverse lipid changes .
Females with hypertriglyceridemia , or a family history thereof , may have an increase in serum triglyceride concentrations when using LOSEASONIQUE , which may increase the risk of pancreatitis .
5 . 8 Headache LOSEASONIQUE is contraindicated in females who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura , and in women over 35 years of age who have migraine headaches with or without aura [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
If a woman taking LOSEASONIQUE develops new headaches that are recurrent , persistent , or severe , evaluate the cause and discontinue LOSEASONIQUE if indicated .
Consider discontinuation of LOSEASONIQUE if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use ( which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event ) .
5 . 9 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Females using LOSEASONIQUE may experience unscheduled ( breakthrough or intracyclic ) bleeding and spotting , especially during the first 3 months of use .
Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product .
If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles , evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy .
When prescribing LOSEASONIQUE , the occurrence of fewer planned menses ( 4 per year instead of 13 per year ) should be weighed against the occurrence of increased unscheduled bleeding and / or spotting .
The clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of LOSEASONIQUE also assessed unscheduled bleeding .
The participants in this 12 - month clinical trial ( N = 2 , 185 ) completed the equivalent of over 20 , 000 28 - day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used OCs previously ( 89 % ) , as opposed to new users ( 11 % ) .
A total of 209 subjects ( 9 . 6 % ) discontinued LOSEASONIQUE , at least in part , due to bleeding and / or spotting .
Scheduled ( withdrawal ) bleeding and / or spotting remained fairly constant over time , with an average of 2 - 3 days of bleeding and / or spotting per each 91 - day cycle .
Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91 - day cycles .
Table 2 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4 .
Table 3 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4 .

Figure 2 : Percent of Women Taking LOSEASONIQUE who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and / or Spotting ( Based on Daily Diaries ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] If unscheduled spotting or bleeding occurs , instruct the patient to continue on the same regimen .
If the bleeding is persistent or prolonged , advise the patient to consult her healthcare provider .
Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Females who use LOSEASONIQUE may experience absence of scheduled ( withdrawal ) bleeding , even if they are not pregnant .
If scheduled bleeding does not occur , consider the possibility of pregnancy .
After discontinuation of LOSEASONIQUE , amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur , especially if these conditions were pre - existent .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 5 . 10 Depression Carefully observe females with a history of depression and discontinue LOSEASONIQUE if depression recurs to a serious degree .
Data on the association of COCs with the onset of depression or exacerbation of existing depression are limited .
5 . 11 Malignant Neoplasms Breast Cancer LOSEASONIQUE is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) and breast cancer risk .
Studies do not show an association between ever ( current or past ) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer .
However , some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users ( < 6 months since last use ) and current users with longer duration of COC use [ see Postmarketing Experience ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Cervical Cancer Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia .
However , there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors .
5 . 12 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of LOSEASONIQUE may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine - binding globulin , sex hormone - binding globulin , and cortisol - binding globulin .
The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased .
5 . 13 Hereditary Angioedema In females with hereditary angioedema , exogenous estrogens , including LOSEASONIQUE , may induce or exacerbate symptoms of hereditary angioedema .
5 . 14 Chloasma Chloasma may occur with LOSEASONIQUE use , especially in females with a history of chloasma gravidarum .
Advise females with a history of chloasma to avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while using LOSEASONIQUE .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling : • Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Vascular events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Liver disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials for LOSEASONIQUE were headaches , irregular and / or heavy uterine bleeding , dysmenorrhea , nausea and / or vomiting and back pain .
( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Teva Pharmaceuticals at 1 - 888 - 483 - 8279 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of LOSEASONIQUE was a 12 - month , multicenter , non - comparative open - label study , which enrolled women aged 18 - 41 , of whom 2 , 185 took at least one dose of LOSEASONIQUE .
Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation : 11 % of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction ; the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were irregular and / or heavy uterine bleeding , headache , mood changes , nausea , acne , and weight gain .
Common Treatment - Emergent Adverse Reactions ( ≥ 5 % of women ) : headaches ( 33 % ) ; irregular and / or heavy uterine bleeding ( 13 % ) , dysmenorrhea ( 11 % ) , nausea and / or vomiting ( 11 % ) , back pain ( 8 % ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Five studies that compared breast cancer risk between ever - users ( current or past use ) of COCs and never - users of COCs reported no association between ever use of COCs and breast cancer risk , with effect estimates ranging from 0 . 90 - 1 . 12 ( Figure 3 ) .
Three studies compared breast cancer risk between current or recent COC users ( < 6 months since last use ) and never users of COCs ( Figure 2 ) .
One of these studies reported no association between breast cancer risk and COC use .
The other two studies found an increased relative risk of 1 . 19 - 1 . 33 with current or recent use .
Both of these studies found an increased risk of breast cancer with current use of longer duration , with relative risks ranging from 1 . 03 with less than one year of COC use to approximately 1 . 4 with more than 8 - 10 years of COC use .
Figure 3 : Relevant Studies of Risk of Breast Cancer with Combined Oral Contraceptives [ MULTIMEDIA ] RR = relative risk ; OR = odds ratio ; HR = hazard ratio .
“ ever COC ” are females with current or past COC use ; “ never COC use ” are females that never used COCs .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The sections below provide information on substances for which data on drug interactions with COCs are available .
There is little information available about the clinical effect of most drug interactions that may affect COCs .
However , based on the known pharmacokinetic effects of these drugs , clinical strategies to minimize any potential adverse effect on contraceptive effectiveness or safety are suggested .
Consult the approved product labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for metabolic enzyme or transporter system alterations .
No formal drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with LOSEASONIQUE .
Enzyme inducers ( e . g . , CYP3A4 ) : May decrease the effectiveness of LOSEASONIQUE or increase breakthrough bleeding .
Counsel patients to use a back - up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with LOSEASONIQUE .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs and Potentially Diminishing the Efficacy of COCs : Table 4 includes substances that demonstrated an important drug interaction with LOSEASONIQUE .
Table 4 : Significant Drug Interactions Involving Substances That Affect COCs Metabolic Enzyme Inducers Clinical effect • Concomitant use of COCs with metabolic enzyme inducers may decrease the plasma concentrations of the estrogen and / or progestin component of COCs .
• Decreased exposure of the estrogen and / or progestin component of COCs may potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs and may lead to contraceptive failure or an increase in breakthrough bleeding .
Prevention or management • Counsel females to use an alternative method of contraception or a backup method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs .
• Continue backup contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to maintain contraceptive reliability .
Examples Aprepitant , barbiturates , bosentan , carbamazepine , efavirenz , felbamate , griseofulvin , oxcarbazepine , phenytoin , rifampin , rifabutin , rufinamide , topiramate , products containing St . John ’ s worta , and certain protease inhibitors ( see separate section on protease inhibitors below ) .
Colesevelam Clinical effect • Concomitant use of COCs with colesevelam significantly decreases systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol .
• Decreased exposure of the estrogen component of COCs may potentially reduce contraceptive efficacy or result in an increase in breakthrough bleeding , depending on the strength of ethinyl estradiol in the COC .
Prevention or management Administer 4 or more hours apart to attenuate this drug interaction .
a Induction potency of St . John ’ s wort may vary widely based on preparation .
Substances increasing the systemic exposure of COCs : Co - administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20 to 25 percent .
Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol , possibly by inhibition of conjugation .
CYP3A inhibitors such as itraconazole , voriconazole , fluconazole , grapefruit juice , or ketoconazole may increase systemic exposure of the estrogen and / or progestin component of COCs .
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) / hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) protease inhibitors and non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant decreases in systemic exposure of the estrogen and / or progestin have been noted when COCs are co - administered with some HIV protease inhibitors ( e . g . , nelfinavir , ritonavir , darunavir / ritonavir , ( fos ) amprenavir / ritonavir , lopinavir / ritonavir , and tipranavir / ritonavir ) , some HCV protease inhibitors ( e . g . , boceprevir and telaprevir ) , and some non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( e . g . , nevirapine ) .
In contrast , significant increases in systemic exposure of the estrogen and / or progestin have been noted when COCs are co - administered with certain other HIV protease inhibitors ( e . g . , indinavir and atazanavir / ritonavir ) and with other non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( e . g . , etravirine ) .
7 . 2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs Table 5 provides significant drug interaction information for drugs co - administered with LOSEASONIQUE .
Table 5 : Significant Drug Interaction Information for Drugs Co - Administered With COCs Lamotrigine Clinical effect • Concomitant use of COCs with lamotrigine may significantly decrease systemic exposure of lamotrigine due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation .
• Decreased systemic exposure of lamotrigine may reduce seizure control .
Prevention or management Dose adjustment may be necessary .
Consult the approved product labeling for lamotrigine .
Thyroid Hormone Replacement Therapy or Corticosteroid Replacement Therapy Clinical effect Concomitant use of COCs with thyroid hormone replacement therapy or corticosteroid replacement therapy may increase systemic exposure of thyroid - binding and cortisol - binding globulin [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) ] .
Prevention or management The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased .
Consult the approved product labeling for the therapy in use [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) ] .
Other Drugs Clinical effect Concomitant use of COCs may decrease systemic exposure of acetaminophen , morphine , salicylic acid , and temazepam .
Concomitant use with ethinyl estradiol - containing COCs may increase systemic exposure of other drugs ( e . g . , cyclosporine , prednisolone , theophylline , tizanidine , and voriconazole ) .
Prevention or management The dosage of drugs that can be affected by this interaction may need to be increased .
Consult the approved product labeling for the concomitantly used drug .
7 . 3 Concomitant Use with Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation Co - administration of LOSEASONIQUE with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir is contraindicated due to potential for ALT elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Co - administration of LOSEASONIQUE and glecaprevir / pibrentasvir is not recommended due to potential for ALT elevations .
7 . 4 Effect on Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may influence the results of certain laboratory tests , such as coagulation factors , lipids , glucose tolerance , and binding proteins .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Discontinue use if pregnancy occurs .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Advise use of another method .
LOSEASONIQUE is not recommended for nursing mothers ; may decrease milk production .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There is no use for contraception in pregnancy ; therefore , LOSEASONIQUE should be discontinued during pregnancy . Epidemiologic studies and meta - analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non - genital birth defects ( including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects ) following exposure to COCs before conception or during early pregnancy .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 percent and 15 to 20 percent , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Contraceptive hormones and / or metabolites are present in human milk .
COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding females .
This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well - established .
When possible , advise the nursing female to use other methods of contraception until she discontinues breastfeeding [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for LOSEASONIQUE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from LOSEASONIQUE or the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of LOSEASONIQUE have been established in women of reproductive age .
Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 as for users 18 years and older .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action COCs prevent pregnancy primarily by suppressing ovulation .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics No pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with LOSEASONIQUE .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption No specific investigation of the absolute bioavailability of LOSEASONIQUE in humans has been conducted .
However , literature indicates that levonorgestrel is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration ( bioavailability nearly 100 % ) and is not subject to first - pass metabolism .
Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but , due to first - pass metabolism in gut mucosa and liver , the systemic bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is approximately 43 % .
The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of LOSEASONIQUE following a single oral dose of three levonorgestrel / ethinyl estradiol combination tablets in normal healthy women under fasting conditions are reported in Table 6 .
Table 6 : Mean ( SD ) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following a Single Dose Administration of Three Tablets of LOSEASONIQUE in 30 Healthy Women under Fasting Conditions AUC0 - ∞ Cmax Tmax T ½ Levonorgestrel 76 . 5 ± 24 . 9 ng * hr / mL 6 . 0 ± 1 . 6 ng / mL 1 . 6 ± 0 . 6 hours 28 . 5 ± 8 . 7 hours Ethinyl estradiol 1335 . 8 ± 365 . 3 pg * hr / mL 122 . 8 ± 39 . 5 pg / mL 1 . 8 ± 0 . 7 hours 17 . 5 ± 7 . 4 hours AUC0 - ∞ = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity Cmax = maximum concentration Tmax = time to maximum concentration The effect of food on the rate and the extent of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol absorption following oral administration of LOSEASONIQUE has not been evaluated .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is reported to be approximately 1 . 8 L / kg and 4 . 3 L / kg , respectively .
Levonorgestrel is about 97 . 5 to 99 % protein - bound , principally to sex hormone binding globulin ( SHBG ) and , to a lesser extent , serum albumin .
Ethinyl estradiol is about 95 to 97 % bound to serum albumin .
Ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG , but induces SHBG synthesis , which leads to decreased levonorgestrel clearance .
Following repeated daily dosing of combination levonorgestrel / ethinyl estradiol OCs , levonorgestrel plasma concentrations accumulate more than predicted based on single - dose pharmacokinetics , due in part , to increased SHBG levels that are induced by ethinyl estradiol , and a possible reduction in hepatic metabolic capacity .
Metabolism Following absorption , levonorgestrel is conjugated at the 17β - OH position to form sulfate conjugates and , to a lesser extent , glucuronide conjugates in plasma .
Significant amounts of conjugated and unconjugated 3α , 5β - tetrahydrolevonorgestrel are also present in plasma , along with much smaller amounts of 3α , 5α - tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16β - hydroxylevonorgestrel .
Levonorgestrel and its phase I metabolites are excreted primarily as glucuronide conjugates .
Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several - fold , and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users .
First - pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol involves formation of ethinyl estradiol - 3 - sulfate in the gut wall , followed by 2 - hydroxylation of a portion of the remaining untransformed ethinyl estradiol by hepatic cytochrome P - 450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) .
Levels of CYP3A4 vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of ethinyl estradiol hydroxylation .
Hydroxylation at the 4 - , 6 - , and 16 - positions may also occur , although to a much lesser extent than 2 - hydroxylation .
The various hydroxylated metabolites are subject to further methylation and / or conjugation .
Excretion About 45 % of levonorgestrel and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and about 32 % are excreted in feces , mostly as glucuronide conjugates .
Ethinyl estradiol is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates , and then undergoes enterohepatic recirculation .
Race The effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of LOSEASONIQUE has not been evaluated .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 11 ) ] 14 CLINICAL STUDIES In a 12 - month multicenter open - label clinical trial , 2 , 185 women aged 18 - 41 were studied to assess the safety and efficacy of LOSEASONIQUE , completing the equivalent of 20 , 937 28 - day cycles of exposure .
The racial demographic of those enrolled was : Caucasian ( 75 % ) , African - American ( 12 % ) , Hispanic ( 10 % ) , Asian ( 2 % ) , and Other ( 2 % ) .
There were no exclusions for body mass index ( BMI ) or weight .
The weight range for those women treated was 87 to 381 lbs . , with a mean weight of 159 lbs .
Among the women in the trial , 59 % were current or recent hormonal contraceptive users , 30 % were prior users ( who had used hormonal contraceptives in the past but not in the 6 months prior to enrollment ) and 11 % were new starts .
Of treated women , 14 . 2 % were lost to follow - up , 11 . 6 % discontinued due to an adverse event , and 10 . 3 % discontinued by withdrawing their consent .
The pregnancy rate ( Pearl Index [ PI ] ) in women aged 18 to 35 years was 2 . 74 pregnancies per 100 women - years of use ( 95 % confidence interval 1 . 92 – 3 . 78 ) , based on 36 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 14 days after the last combination pill .
Cycles in which conception did not occur , but which included the use of backup contraception , were not included in the calculation of the PI .
The PI includes patients who did not take the drug correctly .

What If I Want To Become Pregnant ?
You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish .
Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre - pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the pill .
What should I know about my period when taking LOSEASONIQUE ?
When you take LOSEASONIQUE , which has a 91 - day extended dosing cycle , you should expect to have 4 scheduled periods per year ( bleeding when you are taking the 7 yellow pills ) .
Each period is likely to last about 2 to 3 days .
However , you will probably have more bleeding or spotting between your scheduled periods than if you were using a birth control pill with a 28 - day dosing cycle .
This bleeding or spotting tends to decrease with time .
Do not stop taking LOSEASONIQUE because of this bleeding or spotting .
If the spotting continues for more than 7 consecutive days or if the bleeding is heavy , call your healthcare provider .
What if I miss my scheduled period when taking LOSEASONIQUE ?
You should consider the possibility that you are pregnant if you miss your scheduled period ( no bleeding on the days that you are taking yellow tablets ) .
Since scheduled periods are less frequent when you are taking LOSEASONIQUE , notify your healthcare provider that you have missed your period and that you are taking LOSEASONIQUE .
