4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Description ( 11 ) ] .
Hypersensitivity to any ingredient .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Epistaxis , nasal ulceration , Candida albicans infection , nasal septal perforation , and impaired wound healing .
Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa .
Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers , nasal surgery , or nasal trauma .
( 5 . 1 ) • Close monitoring for glaucoma and cataracts is warranted .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypersensitivity reactions ( e . g . , anaphylaxis , angioedema , urticaria , contact dermatitis , and rash ) have been reported after administration of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray .
Discontinue Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray if such reactions occur .
( 5 . 3 ) • Potential worsening of infections ( e . g . , existing tuberculosis ; fungal , bacterial , viral , or parasitic infection ; ocular herpes simplex ) .
Use with caution in patients with these infections .
More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients .
( 5 . 4 ) • Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals .
If such changes occur , discontinue Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray slowly .
( 5 . 5 ) • Monitor growth of pediatric patients .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Local Nasal Effects Epistaxis In clinical trials of 2 to 26 weeks ' duration , epistaxis was observed more frequently in subjects treated with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray than those who received placebo [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Nasal Ulceration Postmarketing cases of nasal ulceration have been reported in patients treated with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Candida Infection In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered intranasally , the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred .
When such an infection develops , it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray .
Patients using Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa .
Nasal Septal Perforation Postmarketing cases of nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients treated with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Impaired Wound Healing Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing , patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers , nasal surgery , or nasal trauma should avoid using Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray until healing has occurred .
5 . 2 Glaucoma and Cataracts Use of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and / or cataracts .
Therefore , close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure , glaucoma , and / or cataracts .
5 . 3 Hypersensitivity Reactions including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions ( e . g . , anaphylaxis , angioedema , urticaria , contact dermatitis , and rash ) have been reported after administration of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray .
Discontinue Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray if such reactions occur [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Rarely , immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after the administration of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray .
5 . 4 Immunosuppression Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals .
Chickenpox and measles , for example , can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids .
In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized , particular care should be taken to avoid exposure .
How the dose , route , and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known .
The contribution of the underlying disease and / or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known .
If a patient is exposed to chickenpox , prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin ( VZIG ) may be indicated .
If a patient is exposed to measles , prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin ( IG ) may be indicated .
( See the complete prescribing information for VZIG and IG . )
If chickenpox develops , treatment with antiviral agents may be considered .
Intranasal corticosteroids should be used with caution , if at all , in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract ; systemic fungal , bacterial , viral , or parasitic infections ; or ocular herpes simplex .
5 . 5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression When intranasal corticosteroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages , systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear .
If such changes occur , the dosage of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray should be discontinued slowly consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy .
The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency .
In addition , some patients may experience symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal ( e . g . , joint and / or muscular pain , lassitude , depression ) .
Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress .
In patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long - term systemic corticosteroid treatment , rapid decreases in systemic corticosteroid dosages may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms .
5 . 6 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir , atazanavir , clarithromycin , indinavir , itraconazole , nefazodone , nelfinavir , saquinavir , ketoconazole , telithromycin , conivaptan , lopinavir , nefazodone , voriconazole ) with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Effect on Growth Intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray .
To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids , including Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray , titrate each patient ' s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his / her symptoms [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following : • Epistaxis , nasal ulceration , Candida albicans infection , nasal septal perforation , and impaired wound healing [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Cataracts and glaucoma [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Immunosuppression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Effect on growth [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( > 3 % ) are headache , pharyngitis , epistaxis , nasal burning / nasal irritation , nausea / vomiting , asthma symptoms , and cough .
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Wockhardt USA , LLC at 1 - 800 - 445 - 4290 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In controlled US clinical trials , more than 3 , 300 subjects with allergic and nonallergic rhinitis received treatment with intranasal fluticasone propionate .
In general , adverse reactions in clinical trials have been primarily associated with irritation of the nasal mucous membranes , and the adverse reactions were reported with approximately the same frequency by subjects treated with placebo .
Less than 2 % of subjects in clinical trials discontinued because of adverse reactions ; this rate was similar for vehicle placebo and active comparators .
The safety data described below are based on 7 placebo - controlled clinical trials in subjects with allergic rhinitis .
The 7 trials included 536 subjects ( 57 girls and 108 boys aged 4 to 11 years , 137 female and 234 male adolescents and adults ) treated with Fluticasone Propionate 200 mcg once daily over 2 to 4 weeks and 2 placebo - controlled clinical trials which included 246 subjects ( 119 female and 127 male adolescents and adults ) treated with Fluticasone Propionate 200 mcg once daily over 6 months ( Table 1 ) .
Also included in Table 1 are adverse reactions from 2 trials in which 167 children ( 45 girls and 122 boys aged 4 to 11 years ) were treated with Fluticasone Propionate 100 mcg once daily for 2 to 4 weeks .
Table 1 .
Adverse Reactions with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray with > 3 % Incidence and More Common than Placebo in Subjects ≥ 4 Years with Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Reaction Fluticasone Propionate 100 mcg Once Daily ( n = 167 ) % Fluticasone Propionate 200 mcg Once Daily ( n = 782 ) % Placebo ( n = 758 ) % Headache 6 . 6 16 . 1 14 . 6 Pharyngitis 6 . 0 7 . 8 7 . 2 Epistaxis 6 . 0 6 . 9 5 . 4 Nasal burning / nasal irritation 2 . 4 3 . 2 2 . 6 Nausea / vomiting 4 . 8 2 . 6 2 . 0 Asthma symptoms 7 . 2 3 . 3 2 . 9 Cough 3 . 6 3 . 8 2 . 8 Other adverse reactions with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray observed with an incidence less than or equal to 3 % but greater than or equal to 1 % and more common than with placebo included : blood in nasal mucus , runny nose , abdominal pain , diarrhea , fever , flu - like symptoms , aches and pains , dizziness , and bronchitis .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials , the following adverse events have been identified during postapproval use of intranasal fluticasone propionate .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness , frequency of reporting , or causal connection to fluticasone propionate or a combination of these factors .
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Hypersensitivity reactions , including angioedema , skin rash , edema of the face and tongue , pruritus , urticaria , bronchospasm , wheezing , dyspnea , and anaphylaxis / anaphylactoid reactions , which in rare instances were severe .
Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Alteration or loss of sense of taste and / or smell and , rarely , nasal septal perforation , nasal ulcer , sore throat , throat irritation and dryness , cough , hoarseness , and voice changes .
Eye Disorders Dryness and irritation , conjunctivitis , blurred vision , glaucoma , increased intraocular pressure , and cataracts .
Cases of growth suppression have been reported for intranasal corticosteroids , including Fluticasone Propionate [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir , ketoconazole ) : Use not recommended .
May increase risk of systemic corticosteroid effects .
7 . 1 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4 .
The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir , atazanavir , clarithromycin , indinavir , itraconazole , nefazodone , nelfinavir , saquinavir , ketoconazole , telithromycin , conivaptan , lopinavir , nefazodone , voriconazole ) with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur .
Ritonavir A drug interaction trial with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir ( a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ) can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure , resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
During postmarketing use , there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate products , including Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray , USP 50 mcg per spray , with ritonavir , resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing ' s syndrome and adrenal suppression .
Ketoconazole Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate ( 1 , 000 mcg ) and ketoconazole ( 200 mg once daily ) resulted in a 1 . 9 - fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45 % decrease in plasma cortisol area under the curve ( AUC ) , but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic impairment : Monitor patients for signs of increased drug exposure .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C .
There are no adequate and well - controlled trials with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray in pregnant women .
Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Women should be advised to contact their physicians if they become pregnant while taking Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray .
Mice and rats at fluticasone propionate doses approximately 1 and 4 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose ( MRHDID ) for adults ( on a mg / m2 basis at maternal subcutaneous doses of 45 and 100 mcg / kg / day , respectively ) showed fetal toxicity characteristic of potent corticosteroid compounds , including embryonic growth retardation , omphalocele , cleft palate , and retarded cranial ossification .
No teratogenicity was seen in rats at doses up to 3 times the MRHDID ( on a mg / m2 basis at maternal inhalation doses up to 68 . 7 mcg / kg / day ) .
In rabbits , fetal weight reduction and cleft palate were observed at a fluticasone propionate dose approximately 0 . 3 times the MRHDID for adults ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg / kg / day ) .
However , no teratogenic effects were reported at fluticasone propionate doses up to approximately 20 times the MRHDID for adults ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose up to 300 mcg / kg / day ) .
No fluticasone propionate was detected in the plasma in this study , consistent with the established low bioavailability following oral administration [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits .
Experience with oral corticosteroids since their introduction in pharmacologic , as opposed to physiologic , doses suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans .
In addition , because there is a natural increase in corticosteroid production during pregnancy , most women will require a lower exogenous corticosteroid dose and many will not need corticosteroid treatment during pregnancy .
Nonteratogenic Effects Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants born of mothers receiving corticosteroids during pregnancy .
Such infants should be carefully monitored .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether fluticasone propionate is excreted in human breast milk .
However , other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk .
Subcutaneous administration to lactating rats of tritiated fluticasone propionate at a dose approximately 0 . 4 times the MRHDID for adults on a mg / m2 basis resulted in measurable radioactivity in milk .
Since there are no data from controlled trials on the use of intranasal Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray by nursing mothers , caution should be exercised when Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray in children aged 4 years and older have been established [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Six hundred fifty ( 650 ) subjects aged 4 to 11 years and 440 subjects aged 12 to 17 years were studied in US clinical trials with fluticasone propionate nasal spray .
The safety and effectiveness of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray in children younger than 4 years have not been established .
Effects on Growth Controlled clinical trials have shown that intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients .
This effect was observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression , suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function .
The long - term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with intranasal corticosteroids , including the impact on final adult height , are unknown .
The potential for " catch - up " growth following discontinuation of treatment with intranasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied .
The growth of pediatric patients receiving intranasal corticosteroids , including Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray , should be monitored routinely ( e . g . , via stadiometry ) .
The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks associated with alternative therapies .
To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids , including Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray , each patient ' s dosage should be titrated to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his / her symptoms .
A 1 - year placebo - controlled trial was conducted in 150 pediatric subjects ( aged 3 to 9 years ) to assess the effect of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray ( single daily dose of 200 mcg ) on growth velocity .
From the primary population receiving Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray ( n = 56 ) and placebo ( n = 52 ) , the point estimate for growth velocity with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray was 0 . 14 cm / year lower than placebo ( 95 % CI : - 0 . 54 , 0 . 27 cm / year ) .
Thus , no statistically significant effect on growth was noted compared with placebo .
No evidence of clinically relevant changes in HPA axis function or bone mineral density was observed as assessed by 12 - hour urinary cortisol excretion and dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry , respectively .
The potential for Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray to cause growth suppression in susceptible patients or when given at higher than recommended dosages cannot be ruled out .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use A limited number of subjects aged 65 years and older ( n = 129 ) or 75 years and older ( n = 11 ) have been treated with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray in clinical trials .
While the number of subjects is too small to permit separate analysis of efficacy and safety , the adverse reactions reported in this population were similar to those reported by younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Formal pharmacokinetic trials using Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray have not been conducted in subjects with hepatic impairment .
Since fluticasone propionate is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism , impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate in plasma .
Therefore , patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment Formal pharmacokinetic trials using Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray have not been conducted in subjects with renal impairment .
10 OVERDOSAGE Chronic overdosage may result in signs / symptoms of hypercorticism [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Intranasal administration of 2 mg ( 10 times the recommended dose ) of fluticasone propionate twice daily for 7 days was administered to healthy human volunteers .
Adverse events reported with fluticasone propionate were similar to placebo , and no clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory safety tests were observed .
Single oral doses up to 16 mg have been studied in human volunteers with no acute toxic effects reported .
Repeat oral doses up to 80 mg daily for 10 days in volunteers and repeat oral doses up to 10 mg daily for 14 days in patients were well tolerated .
Adverse reactions were of mild or moderate severity , and incidences were similar in active and placebo treatment groups .
Acute overdosage with this dosage form is unlikely since 1 bottle of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray contains approximately 8 mg of fluticasone propionate .
11 DESCRIPTION The active component of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is fluticasone propionate , a corticosteroid having the chemical name S - ( fluoromethyl ) 6α , 9 - difluoro - 11β , 17 - dihydroxy - 16α - methyl - 3 - oxoandrosta - 1 , 4 - diene - 17β - carbothioate , 17 - propionate and the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Fluticasone propionate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 500 . 6 , and the empirical formula is C25H31F3O5S .
It is practically insoluble in water , freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide , and slightly soluble in methanol and 95 % ethanol .
Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray , 50 mcg is an aqueous suspension of microfine fluticasone propionate for topical administration to the nasal mucosa by means of a metering , atomizing spray pump .
Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray also contains microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium , dextrose , 0 . 02 % w / w benzalkonium chloride , polysorbate 80 , and 0 . 25 % w / w phenylethyl alcohol , and has a pH between 5 and 7 .
After initial priming , each actuation delivers 50 mcg of fluticasone propionate in 100 mg of formulation through the nasal adapter .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti - inflammatory activity .
Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone , almost twice that of beclomethasone - 17 - monopropionate ( BMP ) , the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate , and over 3 times that of budesonide .
Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results .
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown .
The precise mechanism through which fluticasone propionate affects rhinitis symptoms is not known .
Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types ( e . g . , mast cells , eosinophils , neutrophils , macrophages , lymphocytes ) and mediators ( e . g . , histamine , eicosanoids , leukotrienes , cytokines ) involved in inflammation .
In 7 trials in adults , Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray has decreased nasal mucosal eosinophils in 66 % of patients ( 35 % for placebo ) and basophils in 39 % of patients ( 28 % for placebo ) .
The direct relationship of these findings to long - term symptom relief is not known .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics HPA Axis Effect The potential systemic effects of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray on the HPA axis were evaluated .
Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray given as 200 mcg once daily or 400 mcg twice daily was compared with placebo or oral prednisone 7 . 5 or 15 mg given in the morning .
Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray at either dosage for 4 weeks did not affect the adrenal response to 6 - hour cosyntropin stimulation , while both dosages of oral prednisone significantly reduced the response to cosyntropin .
Cardiac Electrophysiology A study specifically designed to evaluate the effect of Fluticasone Propionate on the QT interval has not been conducted .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is due to the parent drug , fluticasone propionate .
Due to the low bioavailability by the intranasal route , the majority of the pharmacokinetic data was obtained via other routes of administration .
Absorption Indirect calculations indicate that fluticasone propionate delivered by the intranasal route has an absolute bioavailability averaging less than 2 % .
Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible ( < 1 % ) , primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver .
After intranasal treatment of patients with rhinitis for 3 weeks , fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations were above the level of detection ( 50 pg / mL ) only when recommended doses were exceeded and then only in occasional samples at low plasma levels .
Distribution Following intravenous administration , the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding .
The volume of distribution averaged 4 . 2 L / kg .
The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 99 % .
Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin .
Elimination Following intravenous dosing , fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half - life of approximately 7 . 8 hours .
The total blood clearance of fluticasone propionate is high ( average : 1 , 093 mL / min ) , with renal clearance accounting for less than 0 . 02 % of the total .
Metabolism : The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17β - carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate , which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway .
This metabolite had less affinity ( approximately 1 / 2 , 000 ) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies .
Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man .
Excretion : Less than 5 % of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites , with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites .
Special Populations Fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not studied in any special populations , and no gender - specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained .
Drug Interactions Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 : Ritonavir : Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4 .
Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , ritonavir , is not recommended based upon a multiple - dose , crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects .
Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray ( 200 mcg once daily ) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable ( < 10 pg / mL ) in most subjects , and when concentrations were detectable , peak levels ( Cmax ) averaged 11 . 9 pg / mL ( range : 10 . 8 to 14 . 1 pg / mL ) and AUC ( 0 – τ ) averaged 8 . 43 pg • h / mL ( range : 4 . 2 to 18 . 8 pg • h / mL ) .
Fluticasone propionate Cmax and AUC ( 0 – τ ) increased to 318 pg / mL ( range : 110 to 648 pg / mL ) and 3 , 102 . 6 pg • h / mL ( range : 1 , 207 . 1 to 5 , 662 . 0 pg • h / mL ) , respectively , after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray .
This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease ( 86 % ) in serum cortisol AUC .
Ketoconazole : Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate ( 1 , 000 mcg ) and ketoconazole ( 200 mg once daily ) resulted in a 1 . 9 - fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45 % decrease in plasma cortisol AUC , but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol .
Erythromycin : In a multiple - dose drug interaction study , coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate ( 500 mcg twice daily ) and erythromycin ( 333 mg 3 times daily ) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment of Fertility Fluticasone propionate demonstrated no tumorigenic potential in mice at oral doses up to 1 , 000 mcg / kg ( approximately 20 times the MRHDID in adults and approximately 10 times the MRHDID in children on a mcg / m2 basis ) for 78 weeks or in rats at inhalation doses up to 57 mcg / kg ( approximately 2 times the MRHDID in adults and approximately equivalent to the MRHDID in children on a mcg / m2 basis ) for 104 weeks .
Fluticasone propionate did not induce gene mutation in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells in vitro .
No significant clastogenic effect was seen in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro or in the mouse micronucleus test .
No evidence of impairment of fertility was observed in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg / kg ( approximately 2 times the MRHDID in adults on a mcg / m2 basis ) .
Prostate weight was significantly reduced at a subcutaneous dose of 50 mcg / kg .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Perennial Nonallergic Rhinitis : Three randomized , double - blind , parallel - group , vehicle placebo - controlled trials were conducted in 1 , 191 subjects to investigate regular use of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray in subjects with perennial nonallergic rhinitis .
These trials evaluated subject - rated total nasal symptom scores ( TNSS ) that included nasal obstruction , postnasal drip , rhinorrhea in subjects treated for 28 days of double - blind therapy and in 1 of the 3 trials for 6 months of open - label treatment .
Two of these trials demonstrated that subjects treated with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray ( 100 mcg twice daily ) exhibited statistically significant decreases in TNSS compared with subjects treated with vehicle .
