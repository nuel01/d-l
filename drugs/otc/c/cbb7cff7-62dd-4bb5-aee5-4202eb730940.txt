• Ribavirin monotherapy is not effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection and should not be used alone for this indication .
( See WARNINGS ) .
• The primary toxicity of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia .
The anemia associated with ribavirin therapy may result in worsening of cardiac disease that has lead to fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions .
Patients with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease should not be treated with ribavirin .
( See WARNINGS , ADVERSE REACTIONS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
• Significant teratogenic and / or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin .
In addition , ribavirin has a multiple - dose half - life of 12 days , and so it may persist in nonplasma compartments for as long as 6 months .
Therefore , ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in the male partners of women who are pregnant .
Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy during therapy and for 6 months after completion of treatment in both female patients and in female partners of male patients who are taking ribavirin therapy .
At least two reliable forms of effective contraception must be utilized during treatment and during the 6 - month posttreatment follow - up period .
( See CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Information for Patients and Pregnancy Category X ) .
DESCRIPTION Ribavirin is a nucleoside analog .
The chemical name of ribavirin is 1 - β - D - ribofuranosyl - 1 H - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazole - 3 - carboxamide and has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Ribavirin is a white , crystalline powder .
It is freely soluble in water and slightly soluble in anhydrous alcohol .
The empirical formula is C8H12N4O5 and the molecular weight is 244 . 21 .
Ribavirin capsules consist of white powder in a white , opaque , gelatin capsule .
Each capsule , for oral administration , contains 200 mg ribavirin .
In addition , each capsule contains the following inactive ingredients : croscarmellose sodium , hypromellose , magnesium stearate , mannitol and povidone .
The capsule shell consists of gelatin and titanium dioxide .
The capsule is printed with edible blue pharmaceutical ink which is made of FD & C Blue # 2 aluminum lake , propylene glycol , shellac and titanium dioxide .
Mechanism of Action The mechanism of inhibition of hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) RNA by combination therapy with ribavirin and interferon products has not been established .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Ribavirin Single - and multiple - dose pharmacokinetic properties in adults are summarized in TABLE 1 .
Ribavirin was rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration .
However , due to first - pass metabolism , the absolute bioavailability averaged 64 % ( 44 % ) [ 1 ] .
There was a linear relationship between dose and AUCtf ( AUC from time zero to last measurable concentration ) following single doses of 200 to 1200 mg ribavirin .
The relationship between dose and Cmax was curvilinear , tending to asymptote above single doses of 400 to 600 mg .
Upon multiple oral dosing , based on AUC12hr , a sixfold accumulation of ribavirin was observed in plasma .
Following oral dosing with 600 mg BID , steady - state was reached by approximately 4 weeks , with mean steady - state plasma concentrations of 2200 ( 37 % ) ng / mL .
Upon discontinuation of dosing , the mean half - life was 298 ( 30 % ) hours , which probably reflects slow elimination from nonplasma compartments .
[ 1 ] In this section of the label , numbers in parenthesis indicate % coefficient of variation .
Effect of Food on Absorption of Ribavirin Both AUCtf and Cmax increased by 70 % when ribavirin capsules were administered with a high - fat meal ( 841 kcal , 53 . 8 g fat , 31 . 6 g protein , and 57 . 4 g carbohydrate ) in a single - dose pharmacokinetic study .
There are insufficient data to address the clinical relevance of these results .
Clinical efficacy studies with ribavirin / INTRON ® A ( interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant ) were conducted without instructions with respect to food consumption .
During clinical studies with ribavirin / INTRON A , all subjects were instructed to take ribavirin capsules with food .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Effect of Antacid on Absorption of Ribavirin Coadministration of ribavirin capsules with an antacid containing magnesium , aluminum , and simethicone ( Mylanta ® ) resulted in a 14 % decrease in mean ribavirin AUCtf .
The clinical relevance of results from this single - dose study is unknown .

This type of transporter is present on virtually all cell types and may account for the extensive volume of distribution .
Ribavirin does not bind to plasma proteins .
Ribavirin has two pathways of metabolism : ( i ) a reversible phosphorylation pathway in nucleated cells ; and ( ii ) a degradative pathway involving deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxylic acid metabolite .
Ribavirin and its triazole carboxamide and triazole carboxylic acid metabolites are excreted renally .
After oral administration of 600 mg of 14 C - ribavirin , approximately 61 % and 12 % of the radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and feces , respectively , in 336 hours .
Unchanged ribavirin accounted for 17 % of the administered dose .
Results of in vitro studies using both human and rat liver microsome preparations indicated little or no cytochrome P450 enzyme - mediated metabolism of ribavirin , with minimal potential for P450 enzyme - based drug interactions .
No pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between INTRON A injection and ribavirin capsules in a multiple - dose pharmacokinetic study .
Drug Interactions Ribavirin has been shown in vitro to inhibit phosphorylation of zidovudine and stavudine which could lead to decreased antiretroviral activity .
Exposure to didanosine or its active metabolite ( dideoxyadenosine 5 ’ - triphosphate ) is increased when didanosine is coadministered with ribavirin , which could cause or worsen clinical toxicities ( see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ) .
Special Populations Renal Dysfunction The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin were assessed after administration of a single oral dose ( 400 mg ) of ribavirin to non HCV - infected subjects with varying degrees of renal dysfunction .
The mean AUCtf value was threefold greater in subjects with creatinine clearance values between 10 to 30 mL / min when compared to control subjects ( creatinine clearance > 90 mL / min ) .
In subjects with creatinine clearance values between 30 to 60 mL / min , AUCtf was twofold greater when compared to control subjects .
The increased AUCtf appears to be due to reduction of renal and non - renal clearance in these patients .
Phase III efficacy trials included subjects with creatinine clearance values > 50 mL / min .
The multiple dose pharmacokinetics of ribavirin cannot be accurately predicted in patients with renal dysfunction .
Ribavirin is not effectively removed by hemodialysis .
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min should not be treated with ribavirin ( See WARNINGS ) .
Hepatic Dysfunction The effect of hepatic dysfunction was assessed after a single oral dose of ribavirin ( 600 mg ) .
The mean AUCtf values were not significantly different in subjects with mild , moderate , or severe hepatic dysfunction ( Child - Pugh Classification A , B , or C ) when compared to control subjects .
However , the mean Cmax values increased with severity of hepatic dysfunction and was twofold greater in subjects with severe hepatic dysfunction when compared to control subjects .
Elderly Patients Pharmacokinetic evaluations in elderly subjects have not been performed .
Gender There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic differences noted in a single - dose study of eighteen male and eighteen female subjects .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ribavirin capsules are indicated in combination with INTRON A ( interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant ) Injection for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients 18 years of age and older with compensated liver disease previously untreated with alpha interferon or in patients 18 years of age and older who have relapsed following alpha interferon therapy .
The safety and efficacy of ribavirin capsules with non - pegylated interferons other than the INTRON A product have not been established .
Description of Clinical Studies Ribavirin / INTRON A Combination Therapy Adult Patients Previously Untreated Patients Adults with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV RNA ( assessed by a central laboratory using a research - based RT - PCR assay ) who were previously untreated with alpha interferon therapy were enrolled into two multi - center , double - blind trials ( US and International ) and randomized to receive ribavirin capsules 1200 mg / day ( 1000 mg / day for patients weighing ≤ 75 kg ) plus INTRON A Injection 3 MIU TIW or INTRON A Injection plus placebo for 24 or 48 weeks followed by 24 weeks of off - therapy follow - up .
The International study did not contain a 24 - week INTRON A plus placebo treatment arm .
The US study enrolled 912 patients who , at baseline , were 67 % male , 89 % Caucasian with a mean Knodell HAI score ( I + II + III ) of 7 . 5 , and 72 % genotype 1 .
The International study , conducted in Europe , Israel , Canada , and Australia , enrolled 799 patients ( 65 % male , 95 % Caucasian , mean Knodell score 6 . 8 , and 58 % genotype 1 ) .

Ribavirin capsules are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to ribavirin or any component of the capsule .
Patients with autoimmune hepatitis must not be treated with combination ribavirin / INTRON A therapy because using these medicines can make the hepatitis worse .
Patients with hemoglobinopathies ( e . g . , thalassemia major , sickle - cell anemia ) should not be treated with ribavirin capsules .
WARNINGS Based on results of clinical trials ribavirin monotherapy is not effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection ; therefore , ribavirin capsules must not be used alone .
The safety and efficacy of ribavirin capsules with non - pegylated interferons other than INTRON A product have not been established .
There are significant adverse events caused by ribavirin / INTRON A therapy , including severe depression and suicidal ideation , hemolytic anemia , suppression of bone marrow function , autoimmune and infectious disorders , pulmonary dysfunction , pancreatitis , and diabetes .
Suicidal ideation or attempts occurred more frequently among pediatric patients , primarily adolescents , compared to adult patients ( 2 . 4 % versus 1 % ) during treatment and off - therapy follow - up .
The Appendix to this package insert should be reviewed in its entirety prior to initiation of therapy of ribavirin capsules taken together with INTRON A for additional safety information .
Pregnancy Ribavirin capsules may cause birth defects and / or death of the exposed fetus .
Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients .
Ribavirin capsules have demonstrated significant teratogenic and / or embryocidal effects in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted .
These effects occurred at doses as low as one twentieth of the recommended human dose of ribavirin .
RIBAVIRIN THERAPY SHOULD NOT BE STARTED UNTIL A REPORT OF A NEGATIVE PREGNANCY TEST HAS BEEN OBTAINED IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO PLANNED INITIATION OF THERAPY .
Patients should be instructed to use at least two forms of effective contraception during treatment and during the six month period after treatment has been stopped based on multiple dose half - life of ribavirin of 12 days .
Pregnancy testing should occur monthly during ribavirin therapy and for six months after therapy has stopped ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS : Information for Patients and Pregnancy Category X ) .
Anemia The primary toxicity of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia , which was observed in approximately 10 % of ribavirin / INTRON A - treated patients in clinical trials ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS : Laboratory Values : Hemoglobin ) .
The anemia associated with ribavirin capsules occurs within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy .
BECAUSE THE INITIAL DROP IN HEMOGLOBIN MAY BE SIGNIFICANT , IT IS ADVISED THAT HEMOGLOBIN OR HEMATOCRIT BE OBTAINED PRETREATMENT AND AT WEEK 2 AND WEEK 4 OF THERAPY , OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF CLINICALLY INDICATED .
Patients should then be followed as clinically appropriate .
Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions have been reported in patients with anemia caused by ribavirin .
Patients should be assessed for underlying cardiac disease before initiation of ribavirin therapy .
Patients with pre - existing cardiac disease should have electrocardiograms administered before treatment , and should be appropriately monitored during therapy .
If there is any deterioration of cardiovascular status , therapy should be suspended or discontinued .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Guidelines for Dose Modification ) .
Because cardiac disease may be worsened by drug induced anemia , patients with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease should not use ribavirin .
( See ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Ribavirin and INTRON A therapy should be suspended in patients with signs and symptoms of pancreatitis and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis .
Ribavirin should not be used in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations ) .
Pulmonary Pulmonary symptoms , including dyspnea , pulmonary infiltrates , pneumonitis and pneumonia , have been reported during therapy with ribavirin / INTRON A ; occasional cases of fatal pneumonia have occurred .
In addition , sarcoidosis or the exacerbation of sarcoidosis has been reported .
If there is evidence of pulmonary infiltrates or pulmonary function impairment , the patient should be closely monitored , and if appropriate , combination ribavirin / INTRON A treatment should be discontinued .
Dental and Periodontal Disorders Dental and periodontal disorders have been reported in patients receiving ribavirin and interferon combination therapy .
In addition , dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long - term treatment with the combination of ribavirin capsules and interferon alfa - 2 b .
Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations .
In addition , some patients may experience vomiting .
If this reaction occurs , they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards .
PRECAUTIONS The safety and efficacy of ribavirin / INTRON A therapy for the treatment of HIV infection , adenovirus , RSV , parainfluenza , or influenza infections have not been established .
Ribavirin capsules should not be used for these indications .
Ribavirin for inhalation has a separate package insert , which should be consulted if ribavirin inhalation therapy is being considered .
The safety and efficacy of ribavirin / INTRON A therapy has not been established in liver or other organ transplant patients , patients with decompensated liver disease due to hepatitis C infection , patients who are nonresponders to interferon therapy , or patients coinfected with HBV or HIV .
Information for Patients Patients must be informed that ribavirin capsules may cause birth defects and / or death of the exposed fetus .
Ribavirin must not be used by women who are pregnant or by men whose female partners are pregnant .
Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients taking ribavirin .
Ribavirin should not be initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to initiation of therapy .
Patients must perform a pregnancy test monthly during therapy and for 6 months posttherapy .
Women of childbearing potential must be counseled about use of effective contraception ( two reliable forms ) prior to initiating therapy .
Patients ( male and female ) must be advised of the teratogenic / embryocidal risks and must be instructed to practice effective contraception during ribavirin and for 6 months posttherapy .
Patients ( male and female ) should be advised to notify the physician immediately in the event of a pregnancy .
( See CONTRAINDICATIONSand WARNINGS ) .
If pregnancy does occur during treatment or during 6 months posttherapy , the patient must be advised of the teratogenic risk of ribavirin therapy to the fetus .
Patients , or partners of patients , should immediately report any pregnancy that occurs during treatment or within 6 months after treatment cessation to their physician .
Physicians should report such cases by calling the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry at 1 - 800 - 593 - 2214 .
Patients receiving ribavirin capsules should be informed of the benefits and risks associated with treatment , directed in its appropriate use , and referred to the patient MEDICATION GUIDE for ribavirin capsules .
Patients should be informed that the effect of treatment of hepatitis C infection on transmission is not known , and that appropriate precautions to prevent transmission of the hepatitis C virus should be taken .
The most common adverse experience occurring with ribavirin capsules is anemia , which may be severe .
( See ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Patients should be advised that laboratory evaluations are required prior to starting therapy and periodically thereafter .
( See Laboratory Tests ) .
It is advised that patients be well hydrated , especially during the initial stages of treatment .
Laboratory Tests The following laboratory tests are recommended for all patients treated with ribavirin capsules , prior to beginning treatment and then periodically thereafter .
• Standard hematologic tests – including hemoglobin ( pretreatment , week 2 and week 4 of therapy , and as clinically appropriate [ see WARNINGS ] ) , complete and differential white blood cell counts , and platelet count .
• Blood chemistries – liver function tests and TSH .
• Pregnancy – including monthly monitoring for women of childbearing potential .
• ECG ( See WARNINGS ) Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Ribavirin did not cause an increase in any tumor type when administered for 6 months in the transgenic p53 deficient mouse model at doses up to 300 mg / kg ( estimated human equivalent of 25 mg / kg based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; approximately 1 . 9 times the maximum recommended human daily dose ) .
Ribavirin was non - carcinogenic when administered for 2 years to rats at doses up to 40 mg / kg ( estimated human equivalent of 5 . 71 mg / kg based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ) .
However , this dose was less than the maximum tolerated dose , and therefore the study was not adequate to fully characterize the carcinogenic potential of ribavirin .
Ribavirin demonstrated increased incidences of mutation and cell transformation in multiple genotoxicity assays .
Ribavirin was active in the Balb / 3T3 In Vitro Cell Transformation Assay .
Mutagenic activity was observed in the mouse lymphoma assay , and at doses of 20 to 200 mg / kg ( estimated human equivalent of 1 . 67 to 16 . 7 mg / kg , based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; 0 . 1 to 1 times the maximum recommended human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin ) in a mouse micronucleus assay .
A dominant lethal assay in rats was negative , indicating that if mutations occurred in rats they were not transmitted through male gametes .
Impairment of Fertility Ribavirin demonstrated significant embryocidal and / or teratogenic effects at doses well below the recommended human dose in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted .
Fertile women and partners of fertile women should not receive ribavirin unless the patient and his / her partner are using effective contraception ( two reliable forms ) .
Based on a multiple dose half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of ribavirin of 12 days , effective contraception must be utilized for 6 months posttherapy ( e . g . , 15 half - lives of clearance for ribavirin ) .
Ribavirin should be used with caution in fertile men .
In studies in mice to evaluate the time course and reversibility of ribavirin - induced testicular degeneration at doses of 15 to 150 mg / kg / day ( estimated human equivalent of 1 . 25 to 12 . 5 mg / kg / day , based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; 0 . 1 to 0 . 8 times the maximum human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin ) administered for 3 or 6 months , abnormalities in sperm occurred .
Upon cessation of treatment , essentially total recovery from ribavirin - induced testicular toxicity was apparent within 1 or 2 spermatogenesis cycles .
Animal Toxicology Long - term studies in the mouse and rat ( 18 to 24 months ; doses of 20 to 75 and 10 to 40 mg / kg / day , respectively { estimated human equivalent doses of 1 . 67 to 6 . 25 and 1 . 43 to 5 . 71 mg / kg / day , respectively , based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; approximately 0 . 1 to 0 . 4 times the maximum human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin } ) have demonstrated a relationship between chronic ribavirin exposure and increased incidences of vascular lesions ( microscopic hemorrhages ) in mice .
In rats , retinal degeneration occurred in controls , but the incidence was increased in ribavirin - treated rats .
Pregnancy Category X ( See CONTRAINDICATIONS . )
Ribavirin produced significant embryocidal and / or teratogenic effects in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted .
Malformations of the skull , palate , eye , jaw , limbs , skeleton , and gastrointestinal tract were noted .
The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects increased with escalation of the drug dose .
Survival of fetuses and offspring was reduced .
In conventional embryotoxicity / teratogenicity studies in rats and rabbits , observed no effect dose levels were well below those for proposed clinical use ( 0 . 3 mg / kg / day for both the rat and rabbit ; approximately 0 . 06 times the recommended human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin ) .
No maternal toxicity or effects on offspring were observed in a peri / postnatal toxicity study in rats dosed orally at up to 1 mg / kg / day ( estimated human equivalent dose of 0 . 17 mg / kg based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; approximately 0 . 01 times the maximum recommended human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin ) .
Treatment and Posttreatment Potential Risk to the Fetus Ribavirin is known to accumulate in intracellular components from where it is cleared very slowly .
It is not known whether ribavirin contained in sperm will exert a potential teratogenic effect upon fertilization of the ova .
In a study in rats , it was concluded that dominant lethality was not induced by ribavirin at doses up to 200 mg / kg for 5 days ( estimated human equivalent doses of 7 . 14 to 28 . 6 mg / kg , based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; up to 1 . 7 times the maximum recommended human dose of ribavirin ) .
However , because of the potential human teratogenic effects of ribavirin , male patients should be advised to take every precaution to avoid risk of pregnancy for their female partners .
Women of childbearing potential should not receive ribavirin unless they are using effective contraception ( two reliable forms ) during the therapy period .
In addition , effective contraception should be utilized for 6 months post - therapy based on a multiple - dose half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of ribavirin of 12 days .
Male patients and their female partners must practice effective contraception ( two reliable forms ) during treatment with ribavirin and for the 6 - month post - therapy period ( e . g . , 15 half - lives for ribavirin clearance from the body ) .
Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry A Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry has been established to monitor maternal - fetal outcomes of pregnancies in female patients and female partners of male patients exposed to ribavirin during treatment and for six months following cessation of treatment .
Physicians and patients are encouraged to report such cases by calling the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry at 1 - 800 - 593 - 2214 .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether the ribavirin product is excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from the drug in nursing infants , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to delay or discontinue ribavirin capsules .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ribavirin / INTRON A therapy did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects .
Ribavirin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients often have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection .
Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly .
Ribavirin should not be used in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min .
( See WARNINGS ) .
In general , ribavirin capsules should be administered to elderly patients cautiously , starting at the lower end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic and / or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
In clinical trials , elderly subjects had a higher frequency of anemia ( 67 % ) than did younger patients ( 28 % ) ( See WARNINGS ) .
Pediatric Use Suicidal ideation or attempts occurred more frequently among pediatric patients , primarily adolescents , compared to adult patients ( 2 . 4 % versus 1 % ) during treatment and off - therapy follow - up ( see WARNINGS ) .
As in adult patients , pediatric patients experienced other psychiatric adverse events ( eg , depression , emotional lability , somnolence ) , anemia , and neutropenia ( see WARNINGS ) .
During a 48 - week course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth ( mean percentile assignment decrease of 9 % ) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain ( mean percentile assignment decrease of 13 % ) .
A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 24 - week post - treatment period .
Drug Interactions Didanosine Co - administration of ribavirin capsules and didanosine is not recommended .
Reports of fatal hepatic failure , as well as peripheral neuropathy , pancreatitis , and symptomatic hyperlactactemia / lactic acidosis have been reported in clinical trials ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug Interactions ) .
Stavudine and Zidovudine Ribavirin may antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of stavudine and zidovudine against HIV .
Therefore , concomitant use of ribavirin with either of these drugs should be used with caution ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug Interactions ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The primary toxicity of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia .
Reductions in hemoglobin levels occurred within the first 1 to 2 weeks of oral therapy .
( See WARNINGS ) .
Cardiac and pulmonary events associated with anemia occurred in approximately 10 % of patients ( See WARNINGS ) .
Ribavirin / INTRON A Combination Therapy In clinical trials , 19 % and 6 % of previously untreated and relapse patients , respectively , discontinued therapy due to adverse events in the combination arms compared to 13 % and 3 % in the interferon arms .
Selected treatment - emergent adverse events that occurred in the US studies with ≥ 5 % incidence are provided in TABLE 4 by treatment group .

Laboratory Values Ribavirin / INTRON A Combination Therapy Changes in selected hematologic values ( hemoglobin , white blood cells , neutrophils , and platelets ) during therapy are described below .
( See TABLE 5 ) .
Hemoglobin Hemoglobin decreases among patients receiving ribavirin therapy began at Week 1 , with stabilization by Week 4 .
In previously untreated patients treated for 48 weeks , the mean maximum decrease from baseline was 3 . 1 g / dL in the US study and 2 . 9 g / dL in the International study .
In relapse patients , the mean maximum decrease from baseline was 2 . 8 g / dL in the US study and 2 . 6 g / dL in the international study .
Hemoglobin values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 to 8 weeks of cessation of therapy in most patients .
Bilirubin and Uric Acid Increases in both bilirubin and uric acid , associated with hemolysis , were noted in clinical trials .
Most were moderate biochemical changes and were reversed within 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation .
This observation occurs most frequently in patients with a previous diagnosis of Gilbert ’ s syndrome .
This has not been associated with hepatic dysfunction or clinical morbidity .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
OVERDOSAGE There is limited experience with overdosage .
Acute ingestion of up to 20 grams of ribavirin capsules , INTRON A ingestion of up to 120 million units , and subcutaneous doses of INTRON A up to 10 times the recommended doses have been reported .
Primary effects that have been observed are increased incidence and severity of the adverse events related to the therapeutic use of INTRON A and ribavirin .
However , hepatic enzyme abnormalities , renal failure , hemorrhage , and myocardial infarction have been reported with administration of single subcutaneous doses of INTRON A that exceed dosing recommendations .
There is no specific antidote for INTRON A or ribavirin , and hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective treatment of overdose of either agent .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations ; see WARNINGS . )
Ribavirin / INTRON A Combination Therapy Adults The recommended dose of ribavirin capsules in patients 18 years of age and older depends on the patient ’ s body weight .
The recommended dose of ribavirin is provided in TABLE 6 .
The recommended duration of treatment for patients previously untreated with interferon is 24 to 48 weeks .
The duration of treatment should be individualized to the patient depending on baseline disease characteristics , response to therapy , and tolerability of the regimen .
( See Description of Clinical Studies and ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
After 24 weeks of treatment , virologic response should be assessed .
Treatment discontinuation should be considered in any patient who has not achieved an HCV RNA below the limit of detection of the assay by 24 weeks .
There are no safety and efficacy data on treatment for longer than 48 weeks in the previously untreated patient population .
In patients who relapse following non - pegylated interferon mono - therapy , the recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks .
There are no safety and efficacy data on treatment for longer than 24 weeks in the relapse patient population .

DESCRIPTION Ribavirin Capsules Ribavirin is a nucleoside analog with antiviral activity .
The chemical name of ribavirin is 1 - β - D - ribofuranosyl - 1 H - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazole - 3 - carboxamide and has the following structural formula : Ribavirin is a white , crystalline powder .
It is freely soluble in water and slightly soluble in anhydrous alcohol .
The molecular formula is C8H12N4O5 and the molecular weight is 244 . 21 .
Ribavirin capsules consist of white powder in a white , opaque , gelatin capsule .
Each capsule , for oral administration , contains 200 mg ribavirin .
In addition , each capsule contains the following inactive ingredients : croscarmellose sodium , hypromellose , magnesium stearate , mannitol and povidone .
The capsule shell consists of gelatin and titanium dioxide .
The capsule is printed with edible blue pharmaceutical ink which is made of FD & C Blue # 2 aluminum lake , propylene glycol , shellac and titanium dioxide .
INTRON A INTRON A is Schering Corporation ’ s brand name for interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant , a purified , sterile , recombinant interferon product .
Interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant has been classified as an alpha interferon and is a water - soluble protein composed of 165 amino acids with a molecular weight of 19 , 271 daltons produced by recombinant DNA techniques .
It is obtained from the bacterial fermentation of a strain of Escherichia coli bearing a genetically engineered plasmid containing an interferon alfa - 2 b gene from human leukocytes .
The fermentation is carried out in a defined nutrient medium containing the antibiotic tetracycline hydrochloride at a concentration of 5 to 10 mg / L ; the presence of this antibiotic is not detectable in the final product .
INTRON A Injection is a clear , colorless solution .
The 3 million IU vial of INTRON A Injection contains 3 million IU of interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant per 0 . 5 mL .
The 18 million IU multidose vial of INTRON A Injection contains a total of 22 . 8 million IU of interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant per 3 . 8 mL ( 3 million IU / 0 . 5 mL ) in order to provide the delivery of six 0 . 5 mL doses , each containing 3 million IU of INTRON A ( for a label strength of 18 million IU ) .
The 18 million IU INTRON A Injection multidose pen contains a total of 22 . 5 million IU of interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant per 1 . 5 mL ( 3 million IU / 0 . 2 mL ) in order to provide the delivery of six 0 . 2 - mL doses , each containing 3 million IU of INTRON A ( for a label strength of 18 million IU ) .
Each mL also contains 7 . 5 mg sodium chloride , 1 . 8 mg sodium phosphate dibasic , 1 . 3 mg sodium phosphate monobasic , 0 . 1 mg edetate disodium , 0 . 1 mg polysorbate 80 , and 1 . 5 mg m - cresol as a preservative .
Based on the specific activity of approximately 2 . 6 x 108 IU / mg protein as measured by HPLC assay , the corresponding quantities of interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant in the vials and pen described above are approximately 0 . 012 mg , 0 . 088 mg , and 0 . 087 mg protein , respectively .
Mechanism of Action Ribavirin / Interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant The mechanism of inhibition of hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) RNA by combination therapy with ribavirin capsules and INTRON A has not been established .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant Single - and multiple - dose pharmacokinetic properties of INTRON A ( interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant ) are summarized in TABLE 1 .
Following a single 3 million IU ( MIU ) subcutaneous dose in 12 patients with chronic hepatitis C , mean ( % CV [ 1 ] ) serum concentrations peaked at 7 ( 44 % ) hours .
Following 4 weeks of subcutaneous dosing with 3 MIU three times a week ( TIW ) , interferon serum concentrations were undetectable predose .
However , a twofold increase in bioavailability was noted upon multiple dosing of interferon ; the reason for this is unknown .
Mean half - life values following single - and multiple - dose administrations were 6 . 8 ( 24 % ) hours and 6 . 5 ( 29 % ) hours , respectively .
[ 1 ] In this section of the label , numbers in parenthesis indicate % coefficient of variation .
Ribavirin Single - and multiple - dose pharmacokinetic properties in adults with chronic hepatitis C are summarized in TABLE 1 .
Ribavirin was rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration .
However , due to first - pass metabolism , the absolute bioavailability averaged 64 % ( 44 % ) .
There was a linear relationship between dose and AUCtf ( AUC from time zero to last measurable concentration ) following single doses of 200 to 1200 mg ribavirin .
The relationship between dose and Cmax was curvilinear , tending to asymptote above single doses of 400 to 600 mg .
Upon multiple oral dosing , based on AUC12hr , a sixfold accumulation of ribavirin was observed in plasma .
Following oral dosing with 600 mg BID , steady - state was reached by approximately 4 weeks , with mean steady - state plasma concentrations of 2200 ( 37 % ) ng / mL .
Upon discontinuation of dosing , the mean half - life was 298 ( 30 % ) hours , which probably reflects slow elimination from nonplasma compartments .
Effect of Food on Absorption of Ribavirin Both AUCtf and Cmax increased by 70 % when ribavirin capsules were administered with a high - fat meal ( 841 kcal , 53 . 8 g fat , 31 . 6 g protein , and 57 . 4 g carbohydrate ) in a single - dose pharmacokinetic study .
There are insufficient data to address the clinical relevance of these results .
Clinical efficacy studies were conducted without instructions with respect to food consumption .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
Effect of Antacid on Absorption of Ribavirin Coadministration with an antacid containing magnesium , aluminum , and simethicone ( Mylanta ® ) resulted in a 14 % decrease in mean ribavirin AUCtf .
The clinical relevance of results from this single - dose study is unknown .

This type of transporter is present on virtually all cell types and may account for the extensive volume of distribution .
Ribavirin does not bind to plasma proteins .
Ribavirin has two pathways of metabolism : ( i ) a reversible phosphorylation pathway in nucleated cells ; and ( ii ) a degradative pathway involving deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxylic acid metabolite .
Ribavirin and its triazole carboxamide and triazole carboxylic acid metabolites are excreted renally .
After oral administration of 600 mg of 14 C - ribavirin , approximately 61 % and 12 % of the radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and feces , respectively , in 336 hours .
Unchanged ribavirin accounted for 17 % of the administered dose .
Results of in vitro studies using both human and rat liver microsome preparations indicated little or no cytochrome P450 enzyme - mediated metabolism of ribavirin , with minimal potential for P450 enzyme - based drug interactions .
No pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between INTRON A Injection and ribavirin capsules in a multiple - dose pharmacokinetic study .
Special Populations Renal Dysfunction The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin were assessed after administration of a single oral dose ( 400 mg ) of ribavirin to subjects with varying degrees of renal dysfunction .
The mean AUCtf value was threefold greater in subjects with creatinine clearance values between 10 to 30 mL / min when compared to control subjects ( creatinine clearance > 90 mL / min ) .
This appears to be due to reduction of apparent clearance in these patients .
Ribavirin was not removed by hemodialysis .
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min should not be treated with ribavirin capsules ( see WARNINGS ) .
Hepatic Dysfunction The effect of hepatic dysfunction was assessed after a single oral dose of ribavirin ( 600 mg ) .
The mean AUCtf values were not significantly different in subjects with mild , moderate , or severe hepatic dysfunction ( Child - Pugh Classification A , B , or C ) , when compared to control subjects .
However , the mean Cmax values increased with severity of hepatic dysfunction and was twofold greater in subjects with severe hepatic dysfunction when compared to control subjects .
Elderly Patients Pharmacokinetic evaluations for elderly subjects have not been performed .
Gender There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic differences noted in a single - dose study of eighteen male and eighteen female subjects .
Drug Interactions Ribavirin has been shown in vitro to inhibit phosphorylation of zidovudine and stavudine which could lead to decreased antiretroviral activity .
Exposure to didanosine or its active metabolite ( dideoxyadenosine 5 ’ - triphosphate ) is increased when didanosine is coadministered with ribavirin , which could cause or worsen clinical toxicities ( see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ) .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ribavirin capsules are indicated in combination with INTRON A ( interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant ) Injection for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients 18 years of age and older with compensated liver disease previously untreated with alpha interferon or in patients 18 years of age and older who have relapsed following alpha interferon therapy .
The safety and efficacy of ribavirin capsules with non - pegylated interferons other than the INTRON A product have not been established .
Description of Clinical Studies Previously Untreated Patients Adults with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV RNA ( assessed by a central laboratory using a research - based RT - PCR assay ) who were previously untreated with alpha interferon therapy were enrolled into two multicenter , double - blind trials ( US and International ) and randomized to receive ribavirin capsules 1200 mg / day ( 1000 mg / day for patients weighing ≤ 75 kg ) plus INTRON A Injection 3 MIU TIW or INTRON A Injection plus placebo for 24 or 48 weeks followed by 24 weeks of off - therapy follow - up .
The International study did not contain a 24 - week INTRON A plus placebo treatment arm .
The US study enrolled 912 patients who , at baseline , were 67 % male , 89 % caucasian with a mean Knodell HAI score ( I + II + III ) of 7 . 5 , and 72 % genotype 1 .
The International study , conducted in Europe , Israel , Canada , and Australia , enrolled 799 patients ( 65 % male , 95 % caucasian , mean Knodell score 6 . 8 , and 58 % genotype 1 ) .

Anemia HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA ( HEMOGLOBIN < 10 G / DL ) WAS OBSERVED IN APPROXIMATELY 10 % OF RIBAVIRIN CAPSULES / INTRON A - TREATED PATIENTS IN CLINICAL TRIALS ( See ADVERSE REACTIONS : Laboratory Values : Hemoglobin ) .
ANEMIA OCCURRED WITHIN 1 TO 2 WEEKS OF INITIATION OF RIBAVIRIN THERAPY .
BECAUSE OF THIS INITIAL ACUTE DROP IN HEMOGLOBIN , IT IS ADVISED THAT COMPLETE BLOOD COUNTS ( CBC ) SHOULD BE OBTAINED PRETREATMENT AND AT WEEK 2 AND WEEK 4 OF THERAPY OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF CLINICALLY INDICATED .
PATIENTS SHOULD THEN BE FOLLOWED AS CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE .
The anemia associated with ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy may result in deterioration of cardiac function and / or exacerbation of the symptoms of coronary disease .
Patients should be assessed before initiation of therapy and should be appropriately monitored during therapy .
If there is any deterioration of cardiovascular status , therapy should be suspended or discontinued .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
Because cardiac disease may be worsened by drug induced anemia , patients with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease should not use combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy .
( See ADVERSE REACTIONS . )
Similarly , patients with hemoglobinopathies ( e . g . , thalassemia , sickle - cell anemia ) should not be treated with combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy .
Psychiatric Severe psychiatric adverse events , including depression , psychoses , aggressive behavior , hallucinations , violent behavior ( suicidal ideation , suicidal attempts , suicides ) and rare instances of homicidal ideation have occurred during combination ribavirin capsules / Intron A therapy , both in patients with and without a previous psychiatric disorder .
Ribavirin capsules / Intron A therapy should be used with extreme caution in patients with a history of pre - existing psychiatric disorders , and all patients should be carefully monitored for evidence of depression and other psychiatric symptoms .
Suspension of ribavirin capsules / Intron A therapy should be considered if psychiatric intervention and / or dose reduction is unsuccessful in controlling psychiatric symptoms .
In severe cases , therapy should be stopped immediately and psychiatric intervention sought .
( See ADVERSE REACTIONS . )
Bone Marrow Toxicity INTRON A therapy suppresses bone marrow function and may result in severe cytopenias including very rare events of aplastic anemia .
It is advised that complete blood counts ( CBC ) be obtained pretreatment and monitored routinely during therapy ( see PRECAUTIONS : Laboratory Tests ) .
INTRON A therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop severe decreases in neutrophil ( < 0 . 5 x 109 / L ) or platelet counts ( < 25 x 109 / L ) ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Guidelines for Dose Modifications ) .
Pulmonary Pulmonary symptoms , including dyspnea , pulmonary infiltrates , pneumonitis and pneumonia , have been reported during therapy with ribavirin capsules / INTRON A ; occasional cases of fatal pneumonia have occurred .
In addition , sarcoidosis or the exacerbation of sarcoidosis has been reported .
If there is evidence of pulmonary infiltrates or pulmonary function impairment , the patient should be closely monitored , and if appropriate , combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A treatment should be discontinued .
Other • Ribavirin capsules monotherapy is not effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and should not be used for this indication .

• Diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia have been observed in patients treated with INTRON A . • Ophthalmologic disorders have been reported with treatment with alpha interferons ( including INTRON A therapy ) .
Investigators using alpha interferons have reported the occurrence of retinal hemorrhages , cotton wool spots , and retinal artery or vein obstruction in rare instances .
Any patient complaining of loss of visual acuity or visual field should have an eye examination .
Because these ocular events may occur in conjunction with other disease states , a visual exam prior to initiation of combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy is recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension .
• Acute serious hypersensitivity reactions ( eg , urticaria , angioedema , bronchoconstriction , anaphylaxis ) have been observed in INTRON A - treated patients ; if such an acute reaction develops , combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical therapy instituted .
• Combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy should be discontinued for patients developing thyroid abnormalities during treatment whose thyroid function cannot be controlled by medication .
PRECAUTIONS Exacerbation of autoimmune disease has been reported in patients receiving alpha interferon therapy ( including INTRON A therapy ) .
Ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy should be used with caution in patients with other autoimmune disorders .
There have been reports of interferon , including INTRON A ( interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant ) exacerbating pre - existing psoriasis ; therefore , combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy should be used in these patients only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk .
The safety and efficacy of ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy has not been established in liver or other organ transplant patients , decompensated hepatitis C patients , patients who are nonresponders to interferon therapy , or patients coinfected with HBV or HIV .
The safety and efficacy of ribavirin capsules monotherapy for the treatment of HIV infection , adenovirus , early RSV infection , parainfluenza , or influenza have not been established and ribavirin capsules should not be used for these indications .
There is no information regarding the use of ribavirin capsules with other interferons .
Triglycerides Elevated triglyceride levels have been observed in patients treated with interferon including ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy .
Elevated triglyceride levels should be managed as clinically appropriate .
Severe hypertriglyceridemia ( triglycerides > 1000 mg / dL ) may result in pancreatitis .
Discontinuation of ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy should be considered for patients with persistently elevated triglycerides ( triglycerides > 1000 mg / dL ) associated with symptoms of potential pancreatitis , such as abdominal pain , nausea , or vomiting ( see WARNINGS : Other ) .
Drug Interactions Nucleoside Analogs Administration of nucleoside analogues has resulted in fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis .
Coadministration of ribavirin and nucleoside analogues should be undertaken with caution and only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks .
Information for Patients Combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy must not be used by females who are pregnant or by males whose female partners are pregnant .
Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients taking combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy .
Combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy should not be initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to initiation of therapy .
Patients must perform a pregnancy test monthly during therapy and for 6 months posttherapy .
Females of childbearing potential must be counseled about use of effective contraception ( two reliable forms ) prior to initiating therapy .
Patients ( male and female ) must be advised of the teratogenic / embryocidal risks and must be instructed to practice effective contraception during combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy and for 6 months posttherapy .
Patients ( male and female ) should be advised to notify the physician immediately in the event of a pregnancy .
( See CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
If pregnancy does occur during treatment or during 6 months posttherapy , the patient must be advised of the significant teratogenic risk of ribavirin capsules therapy to the fetus .
Patients , or partners of patients , should immediately report any pregnancy that occurs during treatment or within 6 months after treatment cessation to their physician .
Physicians are encouraged to report such cases by calling the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry at 1 - 800 - 593 - 2214 .
Patients receiving combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A treatment should be directed in its appropriate use , informed of the benefits and risks associated with treatment , and referred to the Appendix of the Medication Guide on ribavirin capsules .
There are no data evaluating whether ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy will prevent transmission of infection to others .
Also , it is not known if treatment with ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy will cure hepatitis C or prevent cirrhosis , liver failure , or liver cancer that may be the result of infection with the hepatitis C virus .
If home use is prescribed , a puncture - resistant container for the disposal of used syringes and needles should be supplied to the patient .
Patients should be thoroughly instructed in the importance of proper disposal and cautioned against any reuse of needles and syringes .
The full container should be disposed of according to the directions provided by the physician .
[ see Appendix to the Medication Guide on ribavirin capsules . ]
To avoid possible transmission of disease , do not share your multidose pen with anyone ; it is for you and you alone .
The most common adverse experiences occurring with combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy are “ flu - like ” symptoms , such as headache , fatigue , myalgia , and fever ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) and appear to decrease in severity as treatment continues .
Some of these “ flu - like ” symptoms may be minimized by bedtime administration of INTRON A therapy .
Antipyretics should be considered to prevent or partially alleviate the fever and headache .
Another common adverse experience associated with INTRON A therapy is thinning of the hair .
Patients should be advised that laboratory evaluations are required prior to starting therapy and periodically thereafter ( see Laboratory Tests ) .
It is advised that patients be well hydrated , especially during the initial stages of treatment .
Laboratory Tests The following laboratory tests are recommended for all patients on combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy , prior to beginning treatment and then periodically thereafter .
• Standard hematologic tests – including hemoglobin ( pretreatment , week 2 and week 4 of therapy , and as clinically appropriate [ see WARNINGS ] ) , complete and differential white blood cell counts , and platelet count .
• Blood chemistries – liver function tests and TSH .
• Pregnancy – including monthly monitoring for females of child bearing potential .
Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Carcinogenicity studies with interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant have not been performed because neutralizing activity appears in the serum after multiple dosing in all of the animal species tested .
Ribavirin did not cause an increase in any tumor type when administered for 6 months in the transgenic p53 deficient mouse model at doses up to 300 mg / kg ( estimated human equivalent of 25 mg / kg based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; approximately 1 . 9 times the maximum recommended human daily dose ) .
Ribavirin was non - carcinogenic when administered for 2 years to rats at doses up to 40 mg / kg ( estimated human equivalent of 5 . 71 mg / kg based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ) .
However , this dose was less than the maximum tolerated dose , and therefore the study was not adequate to fully characterize the carcinogenic potential of ribavirin .
Mutagenicity studies have demonstrated that interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant is not mutagenic .
Ribavirin demonstrated increased incidences of mutation and cell transformation in multiple genotoxicity assays .
Ribavirin was active in the Balb / 3T3 In Vitro Cell Transformation Assay .
Mutagenic activity was observed in the mouse lymphoma assay , and at doses of 20 to 200 mg / kg ( estimated human equivalent of 1 . 67 to 16 . 7 mg / kg , based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; 0 . 1 to 1 times the maximum recommended human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin ) in a mouse micronucleus assay .
A dominant lethal assay in rats was negative , indicating that if mutations occurred in rats they were not transmitted through male gametes .
Impairment of Fertility No reproductive toxicology studies have been performed using interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant in combination with ribavirin .
However , evidence provided below for interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant and ribavirin when administered alone indicate that both agents have adverse effects on reproduction .
It should be assumed that the effects produced by either agent alone will also be caused by the combination of the two agents .
Interferons may impair human fertility .
In studies of interferon alfa - 2 b recombinant administration in nonhuman primates , menstrual cycle abnormalities have been observed .
Decreases in serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been reported in females treated with human leukocyte interferon .
In addition , ribavirin demonstrated significant embryocidal and / or teratogenic effects at doses well below the recommended human dose in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted .
Fertile females and partners of fertile females should not receive combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy unless the patient and his / her partner are using effective contraception ( two reliable forms ) .
Based on a multiple dose half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of ribavirin of 12 days , effective contraception must be utilized for 6 months posttherapy ( e . g . , 15 half - lives of clearance for ribavirin ) .
Combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy should be used with caution in fertile males .
In studies in mice to evaluate the time course and reversibility of ribavirin - induced testicular degeneration at doses of 15 to 150 mg / kg / day ( estimated human equivalent of 1 . 25 to 12 . 5 mg / kg / day , based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; 0 . 1 to 0 . 8 times the maximum human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin ) administered for 3 or 6 months , abnormalities in sperm occurred .
Upon cessation of treatment , essentially total recovery from ribavirin - induced testicular toxicity was apparent within 1 or 2 spermatogenesis cycles .
Animal Toxicology Long - term studies in the mouse and rat ( 18 to 24 months ; doses of 20 to 75 and 10 to 40 mg / kg / day , respectively [ estimated human equivalent doses of 1 . 67 to 6 . 25 and 1 . 43 to 5 . 71 mg / kg / day , respectively , based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; approximately 0 . 1 to 0 . 4 times the maximum human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin ] ) have demonstrated a relationship between chronic ribavirin exposure and increased incidences of vascular lesions ( microscopic hemorrhages ) in mice .
In rats , retinal degeneration occurred in controls , but the incidence was increased in ribavirin - treated rats .
Pregnancy Category X : ( See CONTRAINDICATIONS . )
Interferon alfa - 2 b , recombinant has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta ( rhesus monkeys ) at 15 and 30 million IU / kg ( estimated human equivalent of 5 and 10 million IU / kg , based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ) .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant females .
Ribavirin produced significant embryocidal and / or teratogenic effects in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted .
Malformations of the skull , palate , eye , jaw , limbs , skeleton , and gastrointestinal tract were noted .
The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects increased with escalation of the drug dose .
Survival of fetuses and offspring was reduced .
In conventional embryotoxicity / teratogenicity studies in rats and rabbits , observed no effect dose levels were well below those for proposed clinical use ( 0 . 3 mg / kg / day for both the rat and rabbit ; approximately 0 . 06 times the recommended human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin ) .
No maternal toxicity or effects on offspring were observed in a peri / postnatal toxicity study in rats dosed orally at up to 1 mg / kg / day ( estimated human equivalent dose of 0 . 17 mg / kg based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; approximately 0 . 01 times the maximum recommended human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin ) .
Treatment and Posttreatment Potential Risk to the Fetus Ribavirin is known to accumulate in intracellular components from where it is cleared very slowly .
It is not known whether ribavirin contained in sperm will exert a potential teratogenic effect upon fertilization of the ova .
In a study in rats , it was concluded that dominant lethality was not induced by ribavirin at doses up to 200 mg / kg for 5 days ( estimated human equivalent doses of 7 . 14 to 28 . 6 mg / kg , based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; up to 1 . 7 times the maximum recommended human dose of ribavirin ) .
However , because of the potential human teratogenic effects of ribavirin , male patients should be advised to take every precaution to avoid risk of pregnancy for their female partners .
Females of childbearing potential should not receive combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy unless they are using effective contraception ( two reliable forms ) during the therapy period .
In addition , effective contraception should be utilized for 6 months posttherapy based on a multiple dose half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of ribavirin of 12 days .
Male patients and their female partners must practice effective contraception ( two reliable forms ) during treatment with combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy and for the 6 - month posttherapy period ( e . g . , 15 half - lives for ribavirin clearance from the body ) .
If pregnancy occurs in a patient or partner of a patient during treatment or during the 6 months after treatment cessation , physicians are encouraged to report such cases by calling the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry at ( 800 ) 593 - 2214 .
Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry A Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry has been established to monitor maternal - fetal outcomes of pregnancies in female patients and female partners of male patients exposed to ribavirin during treatment and for six months following cessation of treatment .
Physicians and patients are encouraged to report such cases by calling the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry at 1 - 800 - 593 - 2214 .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether ribavirin capsules and INTRON A are excreted in human milk .
However , studies in mice have shown that mouse interferons are excreted into the milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from the drugs in nursing infants , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy , taking into account the importance of the therapy to the mother .
Pediatric Use Suicidal ideation or attempts occurred more frequently among pediatric patients compared to adult patients ( 2 . 4 % versus 1 % ) during treatment and off therapy follow - up ( see WARNINGS ) .
As in adult patients , pediatric patients experienced other psychiatric adverse events ( e . g . , depression , emotional lability , somnolence ) , anemia , and neutropenia ( see WARNINGS ) .
During a 48 week course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth ( mean percentile assignment decrease of 7 % ) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain ( mean percentile assignment decrease of 9 % ) .
A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 24 week post treatment period .
Injection site disorders , fever , anorexia , vomiting , and emotional lability occurred more frequently in pediatric patients compared to adult patients .
Conversely , pediatric patients experienced less fatigue , dyspepsia , arthralgia , insomnia , irritability , impaired concentration , dyspnea , and pruritis compared to adult patients .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of combination therapy of ribavirin capsules taken together with INTRON A did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects .
In clinical trials , elderly subjects had a higher frequency of anemia ( 67 % ) than did younger patients ( 28 % ) ( see WARNINGS ) .
In general , ribavirin capsules should be administered to elderly patients cautiously , starting at the lower end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased renal , hepatic and / or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
Ribavirin capsules are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to ribavirin may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients often have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection .
Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments of ribavirin should be made accordingly ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Guidelines for Dose Modification ) .
Ribavirin capsules should not be used in elderly patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min ( see WARNINGS ) .
Ribavirin capsules taken together with INTRON A should be used very cautiously in elderly patients with a history of psychiatric disorders ( see WARNINGS ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy was evaluated in controlled trials of 1010 HCV - infected adults who were previously untreated with interferon therapy and were subsequently treated for 24 or 48 weeks with combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy and in 173 HCV - infected patients who had relapsed after interferon therapy and were subsequently treated for 24 weeks with combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy .
( See Description of Clinical Studies . )
Overall , 19 % and 6 % of previously untreated and relapse patients , respectively , discontinued therapy due to adverse events in the combination arms compared to 13 % and 3 % in the interferon arms .
The primary toxicity of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia .
Reductions in hemoglobin levels occurred within the first 1 to 2 weeks of therapy ( see WARNINGS ) .
Cardiac and pulmonary events associated with anemia occurred in approximately 10 % of patients treated with ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy .
( See WARNINGS . )
The most common psychiatric events occurring in US studies of previously untreated and relapse patients treated with ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy , respectively , were insomnia ( 39 % , 26 % ) , depression ( 34 % , 23 % ) , and irritability ( 27 % , 25 % ) .
Suicidal behavior ( ideation , attempts , and suicides ) occurred in 1 % of patients .
( See WARNINGS . )
In addition , the following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing surveillance of ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy : hearing disorder and vertigo .
Very rarely , combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A therapy may be associated with aplastic anemia .
Selected treatment - emergent adverse events that occurred in the US studies with ≥ 5 % incidence are provided in TABLE 4 by treatment group .
In general , the selected treatment - emergent adverse events reported with lower incidence in the international studies as compared to the US studies with the exception of asthenia , influenza - like symptoms , nervousness , and pruritus .

A patient may have reported more than one adverse event within a body system / organ class category .
Laboratory Values Changes in selected hematologic values ( hemoglobin , white blood cells , neutrophils , and platelets ) during combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A treatment are described below ( see TABLE 5 ) .
Hemoglobin Hemoglobin decreases among patients on combination therapy began at Week 1 , with stabilization by Week 4 .
In previously untreated patients treated for 48 weeks the mean maximum decrease from baseline was 3 . 1 g / dL in the US study and 2 . 9 g / dL in the International study .
In relapse patients the mean maximum decrease from baseline was 2 . 8 g / dL in the US study and 2 . 6 g / dL in the International study .
Hemoglobin values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 to 8 weeks of cessation of therapy in most patients .
Neutrophils There were decreases in neutrophil counts in both the combination ribavirin capsules / INTRON A and INTRON A plus placebo dose groups .
In previously untreated patients treated for 48 weeks the mean maximum decrease in neutrophil count in the US study was 1 . 3 x 109 / L and in the International study was 1 . 5 x 109 / L .
In relapse patients the mean maximum decrease in neutrophil count in the US study was 1 . 3 x 109 / L and in the International study was 1 . 6 x 109 / L .
Neutrophil counts returned to pretreatment levels within 4 weeks of cessation of therapy in most patients .
Platelets In both previously untreated and relapse patients mean platelet counts generally remained in the normal range in all treatment groups , however , mean platelet counts were 10 % to 15 % lower in the INTRON A plus placebo group than the ribavirin capsules / INTRON A group .
Mean platelet counts returned to baseline levels within 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation .
Thyroid Function Of patients who entered the previously untreated ( 24 and 48 week treatment ) and relapse ( 24 week treatment ) studies without thyroid abnormalities , approximately 3 % to 6 % and 1 % to 2 % , respectively , developed thyroid abnormalities requiring clinical intervention .
Bilirubin and Uric Acid Increases in both bilirubin and uric acid , associated with hemolysis , were noted in clinical trials .
Most were moderate biochemical changes and were reversed within 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation .
This observation occurs most frequently in patients with a previous diagnosis of Gilbert ’ s syndrome .
This has not been associated with hepatic dysfunction or clinical morbidity .

Acute ingestion of up to 20 grams of ribavirin capsules , INTRON A ingestion of up to 120 million units , and subcutaneous doses of INTRON A up to 10 times the recommended doses have been reported .
Primary effects that have been observed are increased incidence and severity of the adverse events related to the therapeutic use of INTRON A and ribavirin capsules .
However , hepatic enzyme abnormalities , renal failure , hemorrhage , and myocardial infarction have been reported with administration of single subcutaneous doses of INTRON A that exceed dosing recommendations .
There is no specific antidote for INTRON A or ribavirin capsules , and hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective for treatment of overdose of either agent .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION INTRON A Injection should be administered subcutaneously and ribavirin capsules should be administered orally .
Ribavirin capsules may be administered without regard to food , but should be administered in a consistent manner .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY . )
Adults The recommended dose of ribavirin capsules in patients 18 years of age and older depends on the patient ’ s body weight .
The recommended doses of ribavirin capsules and INTRON A for adults are given in TABLE 6 .
The recommended duration of treatment for patients previously untreated with interferon is 24 to 48 weeks .

HOW TO USE YOUR INTRON A Multidose Pen When you are ready to give your injection prepare your pen as follows ( NOTE : Boldface print indicates ACTION STEPS ) : • First check that you have the correct INTRON A multidose pen as prescribed by your health care provider , ( i . e . the six doses of 3 MIU INTRON A multidose pen which have a brown push button and a brown color coding strip ) .
• Pull off the cap of the pen and disinfect the rubber membrane ( see Diagram C ) with one alcohol wipe .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram C • Remove the protective tab from the Novofine4 needle .
Note that the rear portion of the needle is revealed once the protective tab is removed ( see Diagram D ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram D • Gently push the Novofine4 needle onto the pen as shown in Diagram E . ( Notice that the rear portion of the needle described in Step 3 will pierce through the rubber membrane that you disinfected previously . )
Now screw the needle onto the INTRON A multidose pen securely by turning it in a clockwise direction ( see Diagram F ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram E [ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram F • First , pull off the outer needle cap ( Diagram G ) .
Then , pull off the inner needle cap carefully , bearing in mind that the needle will now be exposed ( Diagram H ) .
Keep the outer needle cap for later use .
The pen is now ready to use .
Since a small amount of air may collect in the needle and reservoir during storage , the next step is to remove any air bubbles .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram G [ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram H • Hold the INTRON A multidose pen with the needle point upwards .
• Tap the reservoir with your finger so that any air bubbles rise to the top of the reservoir , just below the needle ( Diagram I ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram I • Hold the pen by the barrel and turn the reservoir in the direction as indicated by the arrow in Diagram J ( clockwise ) until you feel it click .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram J • Keeping the pen pointing upwards , press the push button up fully and see if a drop of INTRON A solution appears at the needle tip ( notice the drop at the tip of needle in Diagram K ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram K • If no drop appears then repeat Steps 7 , 8 , and 9 until a drop appears at the needle tip .
Note : Some air may still remain in the pen , but this is not important as you have removed the air from the needle and the dose will be accurate .
• Replace the INTRON A multidose pen cap with the ‘ triangle ’ opposite the dosage indicator as seen in Diagram L .
The pen is now ready to set the dose .
For the next step hold the pen in the middle of the barrel .
This will allow the push button to move freely , ensuring that the correct dose is set .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram L • To set the required dose , hold the pen horizontally by the barrel with one hand .
With the other hand , turn the cap in a clockwise direction indicated by the arrow in Diagram M .
You will observe the push button rising , indicating the dose set .
To set a 3 MIU dose , turn the cap 2 full turns ( 10 clicks ) = 3 . 0 MIU .
Note : If your health care provider has prescribed a dose other than 3 MIU , the correct dose can be set by turning the cap as many times as indicated as follows : 1 full turn ( 5 clicks ) = 1 . 5 MIU 3 full turns ( 15 clicks ) = 4 . 5 MIU 4 full turns ( 20 clicks ) = 6 . 0 MIU The push button scale will show you the dose set ( see Diagram N ) .
At that point check that you have the correct dose .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram M [ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram N • After each complete turn make sure that the triangle is opposite the dosage indicator ( see Diagram O ) .
If you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the cap back ( counter - clockwise ) as far as you can until the push button is fully home and start again .
Once the correct dose is set , you are ready to give the injection .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram O • To give the injection , remove the pen cap from the needle .
With one hand , pinch a 2 - inch fold of loose skin .
• With your other hand , pick up the pen and hold it as you would a pencil .
Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of approximately 45 ° ( see Diagram P ) then press the push button down fully .
If blood comes into the pen , do not inject .
Withdraw the needle and consult your physician or pharmacist .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram P • Leave the needle in place for a few seconds , while holding down the push button , to allow the INTRON A Solution to distribute under the skin .
• Slowly release the push button , then remove the needle .
• Carefully replace the outerneedle cap using a scooping motion ( See Diagram Q ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram Q • Completely unscrew the needle assembly using a counterclockwise turning motion as show in Diagram R .
Then carefully lift it off the pen and discard the capped needle ( see Diagram S ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram R [ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram S • Replace the pen cap with the triangle once again opposite the dosage indicator as shown in Diagram T . [ MULTIMEDIA ] Diagram T Instructional leaflet and video are available through your healthcare provider .
