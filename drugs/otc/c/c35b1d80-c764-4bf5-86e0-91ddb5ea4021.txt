6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In three Phase 3 clinical trials , 616 subjects were exposed to Luliconazole Cream , 1 % : 305 with interdigital tinea pedis and 311 subjects with tinea cruris .
Subjects with interdigital tinea pedis or tinea cruris applied Luliconazole Cream , 1 % or vehicle cream once daily for 14 days or 7 days , respectively , to affected and adjacent areas .
During clinical trials with Luliconazole Cream , 1 % , the most common adverse reactions were application site reactions which occurred in less than 1 % of subjects in both the Luliconazole and vehicle arms .
Most adverse reactions were mild in severity .
A post - approval clinical trial was conducted in 75 subjects age 2 to < 18 years old with tinea corporis .
The adverse reactions in the Luliconazole Cream , 1 % treated population were similar to the vehicle treated population .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of luliconazole cream , 1 % : contact dermatitis and cellulitis .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS An in vivo study in adult subjects with moderate to severe interdigital tinea pedis and tinea cruris showed that Luliconazole Cream , 1 % is mostly a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19 .
In a separate trial in adolescent subjects with tinea cruris , in vivo blood levels of Luliconazole Cream , 1 % , were seen to approach those levels sufficient to show moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with Luliconazole Cream , 1 % use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage .
In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits , there were no adverse developmental effects observed with subcutaneous administration of luliconazole during organogenesis at doses up to 3 and 24 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) [ see Data ] .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data The animal multiples of human exposure calculations were based on daily dose body surface area ( BSA ) comparisons ( mg / m2 ) for the reproductive toxicology studies described in this section and in Section 13 . 1 .
The maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) was set at 8 g 1 % cream per day ( 1 . 33 mg / kg / day for a 60 kg individual , which is equivalent to 49 . 2 mg / m2 / day ) .
Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits .
Subcutaneous doses of 1 , 5 and 25 mg / kg / day luliconazole were administered during the period of organogenesis ( gestational days 7 - 17 ) to pregnant female rats .
No treatment - related effects on maternal toxicity or malformations were noted at 25 mg / kg / day ( 3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) .
Increased incidences of skeletal variation ( 14 th rib ) were noted at 25 mg / kg / day .
No treatment - related effects on skeletal variation were noted at 5 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) .
Subcutaneous doses of 4 , 20 and 100 mg / kg / day luliconazole were administered during the period of organogenesis ( gestational days 6 - 18 ) to pregnant female rabbits .
No treatment - related effects on maternal toxicity , embryofetal toxicity or malformations were noted at 100 mg / kg / day ( 24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) .
In a pre - and postnatal development study in rats , subcutaneous doses of 1 , 5 and 25 mg / kg / day luliconazole were administered from the beginning of organogenesis ( gestation day 7 ) through the end of lactation ( lactation day 20 ) .
In the presence of maternal toxicity , embryofetal toxicity ( increased prenatal pup mortality , reduced live litter sizes and increased postnatal pup mortality ) was noted at 25 mg / kg / day .
No embryofetal toxicity was noted at 5 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) .
No treatment effects on postnatal development were noted at 25 mg / kg / day ( 3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of luliconazole in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant , or the effects of the drug on milk production after topical application of Luliconazole Cream , 1 % to women who are breastfeeding .
Luliconazole Cream , 1 % has low systemic absorption .
The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of Luliconazole Cream , 1 % to an infant during lactation .
Therefore , the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Luliconazole Cream , 1 % and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Luliconazole Cream , 1 % or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Luliconazole Cream , 1 % in pediatric patients 12 to < 18 years of age with tinea pedis and tinea cruris have been established by evidence from well - controlled trials in adult and pediatric subjects and a pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study in pediatric subjects [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of Luliconazole Cream , 1 % in pediatric patients 2 to < 18 years of age with tinea corporis have been established by evidence from a well - controlled trial in pediatric subjects [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Luliconazole Cream , 1 % is an azole antifungal [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics At therapeutic doses , Luliconazole Cream , 1 % is not expected to prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Luliconazole is the R enantiomer of a chiral molecule .
The potential for interconversion between R and S enantiomers in humans has not been assessed .
Information on the pharmacokinetics of luliconazole presented below refers to both R enantiomer and S enantiomer , if any , combined .
Luliconazole is > 99 % protein bound in plasma .
In a PK trial , 12 subjects with moderate to severe tinea pedis and 8 subjects with moderate to severe tinea cruris applied a mean daily amount of approximately 3 . 5 grams of Luliconazole Cream , 1 % to the affected and surrounding areas once daily for 15 days .
Plasma concentrations of luliconazole on Day 15 were measurable in all subjects and fluctuated little during the 24 - hour interval .
In subjects with tinea pedis , the mean ± SD of the maximum concentration ( Cmax ) was 0 . 40 ± 0 . 76 ng / mL after the first dose and 0 . 93 ± 1 . 23 ng / mL after the final dose .
The mean time to reach Cmax ( Tmax ) was 16 . 9 ± 9 . 39 hours after the first dose and 5 . 8 ± 7 . 61 hours after the final dose .
Exposure to luliconazole , as expressed by area under the concentration time curve ( AUC0 – 24 ) , was 6 . 88 ± 14 . 50 ng * hr / mL after the first dose and 18 . 74 ± 27 . 05 ng * hr / mL after the final dose .
In subjects with tinea cruris , the mean ± SD Cmax was 4 . 91 ± 2 . 51 ng / mL after the first dose and 7 . 36 ± 2 . 66 ng / mL after the final dose .
The mean Tmax was 21 . 0 ± 5 . 55 hours after the first dose and 6 . 5 ± 8 . 25 hours after the final dose .
Exposure to luliconazole , as expressed by AUC0 – 24 , was 85 . 1 ± 43 . 69 ng * hr / mL after the first dose and 121 . 74 ± 53 . 36 ng * hr / mL after the final dose .
PK data of luliconazole measured in adolescent subjects ( 12 to < 18 years of age ) with moderate to severe interdigital tinea pedis or moderate to severe tinea cruris as well as in subjects 2 to < 18 years of age with tinea corporis are described in Specific Populations below .
Specific Populations PK of luliconazole was assessed in 30 adolescent subjects 12 to < 18 years of age with moderate to severe interdigital tinea pedis ( N = 15 ) or moderate to severe tinea cruris ( N = 15 ) .
Subjects with tinea pedis applied approximately 3 grams of Luliconazole Cream , 1 % once daily to the affected area and adjacent skin for 15 days , while subjects with tinea cruris applied Luliconazole Cream , 1 % once daily to the affected and adjacent skin for 8 days .
Generally , the systemic exposure of luliconazole was greater in the subjects with tinea cruris than tinea pedis .
In subjects with tinea pedis , the systemic concentrations of luliconazole were quantifiable in all the subjects on Day 8 and Day 15 .
The mean ± SD Cmax was 1 . 80 ± 1 . 86 ng / mL after the first dose on Day 1 , and 3 . 93 ± 1 . 67 ng / mL and 3 . 27 ± 1 . 71 ng / mL on Days 8 and 15 , respectively .
The mean ± SD AUC0 - 24 was 20 . 47 ± 14 . 47 ng * hr / mL after the first dose on Day 1 , and 64 . 94 ± 32 . 47 ng * hr / mL and 60 . 38 ± 37 . 92 ng * hr / mL on Days 8 and Day 15 , respectively .
Like in adult subjects , the mean plasma concentrations of luliconazole in adolescent subjects on Days 8 and 15 were similar and fluctuated little during a 24 - hour interval .
In subjects with moderate to severe tinea cruris , the systemic concentrations of luliconazole were quantifiable in all the subjects on Day 8 .
The mean ± SD Cmax was 9 . 80 ± 5 . 94 ng / mL after the first dose ( Day 1 ) and 15 . 40 ± 13 . 62 ng / mL after the last dose ( Day 8 ) .
The mean ± SD AUC0 - 24 was 157 . 07 ± 92 . 18 ng * hr / mL and 266 . 06 ± 236 . 07 ng * hr / mL , after the first dose ( Day 1 ) and the last dose ( Day 8 ) .
In subjects with tinea corporis , the systemic concentrations of luliconazole were assessed at pre - dose and at 6 hours post - dose on the last day of treatment following once daily treatment with Luliconazole Cream , 1 % for 7 days .
The systemic concentrations were quantifiable in all the 12 subjects and the mean ± SD daily dose of Luliconazole Cream , 1 % was 2 . 84 ± 1 . 82 g .
The mean ± SD concentrations of luliconazole at 15 minutes prior to dosing and at 6 hours post - dose on Day 7 were 4 . 63 ± 2 . 93 ng / mL and 4 . 84 ± 3 . 33 ng / mL , respectively .
Drug Interactions Results of in vitro studies indicated that therapeutic doses of Luliconazole Cream , 1 % did not inhibit cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes 1A2 , 2C9 and 2D6 , but can inhibit the activity of CYP2B6 , 2C8 , 2C19 , and 3A4 .
The most sensitive enzyme , CYP2C19 , was further evaluated in an in vivo study using omeprazole as a probe substrate in adult subjects with moderate to severe interdigital tinea pedis and tinea cruris .
The results showed that Luliconazole Cream , 1 % applied at a daily amount of approximately 4 grams increased the omeprazole systemic exposure ( AUC ) by approximately 30 % compared to the exposure of omeprazole administered alone .
Luliconazole Cream , 1 % is considered a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19 .
For tinea cruris , extrapolation from both in vitro inhibition studies and in vivo data in adults to the adolescent subjects showed that in some subjects , levels of luliconazole can approach or exceed those required to be a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 .
Results of in vitro studies indicated that therapeutic doses of Luliconazole Cream , 1 % did not induce CYP1A2 , 2B6 , and 3A4 .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Luliconazole is an antifungal that belongs to the azole class .
Although the exact mechanism of action against dermatophytes is unknown , luliconazole appears to inhibit ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol demethylase .
Inhibition of this enzyme ’ s activity by azoles results in decreased amounts of ergosterol , a constituent of fungal cell membranes , and a corresponding accumulation of lanosterol .
Mechanism of Resistance To date , a mechanism of resistance to luliconazole has not been described .
Luliconazole Cream , 1 % has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following fungi , both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section : • Trichophyton rubrum • Epidermophyton floccosum 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Luliconazole Cream , 1 % have not been conducted .
Luliconazole revealed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests ( Ames assay and Chinese hamster lung cell chromosomal aberration assay ) and one in vivo genotoxicity test ( mouse bone marrow micronucleus test ) .
In a fertility study in rats , subcutaneous doses of 1 , 5 and 25 mg / kg / day luliconazole were administered prior to and during mating and through early pregnancy .
Treatment - related effects on reproductive function were noted in females ( decreased live embryos and decreased corpus luteum ) at 5 and 25 mg / kg / day and males ( decreased sperm counts ) at 25 mg / kg / day .
No treatment - related effects on fertility or reproductive function were noted at 1 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 1 × MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) .
