2 . 3 Recommended Dosage for Pediatric Patients The recommended dosage of abacavir sulfate in HIV - 1 - infected pediatric patients aged 3 months and older is 8 mg per kg orally twice daily or 16 mg per kg orally once - daily ( up to a maximum of 600 mg daily ) in combination with other antiretroviral agents .
Abacavir tablet is also available as a scored tablet for HIV - 1 - infected pediatric patients weighing greater than or equal to 14 kg for whom a solid dosage form is appropriate .
Before prescribing abacavir tablets , children should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets .
If a child is unable to reliably swallow abacavir tablets , the oral solution formulation should be prescribed .
The recommended oral dosage of abacavir tablets for HIV - 1 - infected pediatric patients is presented in Table 1 .
Table 1 .
Dosing Recommendations for Abacavir Scored Tablets in Pediatric Patients Weight ( kg ) Once - Daily Dosing Regimen [ 1 ] Twice - Daily Dosing Regimen AM Dose PM Dose Total Daily Dose 14 to < 20 1 tablet ( 300 mg ) ½ tablet ( 150 mg ) ½ tablet ( 150 mg ) 300 mg ≥ 20 to < 25 1 ½ tablets ( 450 mg ) ½ tablet ( 150 mg ) 1 tablet ( 300 mg ) 450 mg ≥ 25 2 tablets ( 600 mg ) 1 tablet ( 300 mg ) 1 tablet ( 300 mg ) 600 mg [ 1 ] Data regarding the efficacy of once - daily dosing is limited to subjects who transitioned from twice - daily dosing to once - daily dosing after 36 weeks of treatment [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
2 . 4 Recommended Dosage for Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of abacavir sulfate in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A ) is 200 mg twice daily .
To enable dose reduction , abacavir oral solution ( 10 mL twice daily ) should be used for the treatment of these patients .
The safety , efficacy , and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment ; therefore , abacavir sulfate is contraindicated in these patients .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Tablets : 300 mg scored Abacavir tablets contain 300 mg of abacavir as abacavir sulfate .
The tablets are yellow coloured , capsule shaped , biconvex , film coated , having scoreline on both sides with " 5 " and " 14 " debossed on either side of scoreline on one side .
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Presence of HLA - B * 5701 allele .
( 4 ) • Prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir .
( 4 ) • Moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
( 4 ) Abacavir tablet is contraindicated in patients : • who have the HLA - B * 5701 allele [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• with prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis , including fatal cases , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues .
( 5 . 2 ) • Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir sulfate .
These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi - organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir sulfate ( median time to onset was 9 days ) ; although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during treatment [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Patients who carry the HLA - B * 5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions ; although , patients who do not carry the HLA - B * 5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions .
Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 ( 8 % ) of 2 , 670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir - containing products where HLA - B * 5701 screening was not performed .
The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1 % when subjects carrying the HLA - B * 5701 allele were excluded .
In any patient treated with abacavir , the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making .
Due to the potential for severe , serious , and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir sulfate : • All patients should be screened for the HLA - B * 5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir tablets or reinitiation of therapy with abacavir tablets , unless patients have a previously documented HLA - B * 5701 allele assessment .
• Abacavir tablet is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA - B * 5701 - positive patients .
• Before starting abacavir tablets , review medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir - containing product .
NEVER restart abacavir tablets or any other abacavir - containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir , regardless of HLA - B * 5701 status .
• To reduce the risk of a life - threatening hypersensitivity reaction , regardless of HLA - B * 5701 status , discontinue abacavir tablets immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected , even when other diagnoses are possible ( e . g . , acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia , bronchitis , pharyngitis , or influenza ; gastroenteritis ; or reactions to other medications ) .
• If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out , do not restart abacavir tablets or any other abacavir - containing products because more severe symptoms which may include life - threatening hypotension and death , can occur within hours .
• If a hypersensitivity reaction is ruled out , patients may restart abacavir tablets .
Rarely , patients who have stopped abacavir for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity have also experienced life - threatening reactions within hours of reinitiating abacavir therapy .
Therefore , reintroduction of abacavir tablets or any other abacavir - containing product is recommended only if medical care can be readily accessed .
• A Medication Guide and Warning Card that provide information about recognition of hypersensitivity reactions should be dispensed with each new prescription and refill .
5 . 2 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis , including fatal cases , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues , including abacavir .
A majority of these cases have been in women .
Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues .
Treatment with abacavir tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity , which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevation 5 . 3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including abacavir sulfate .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [ PCP ] , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ' disease , polymyositis , and Guillain - Barre syndrome ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 4 Myocardial Infarction Several prospective , observational , epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction ( MI ) .
Meta - analyses of randomized , controlled , clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir - treated subjects as compared with control subjects .
To date , there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk .
In totality , the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency ; therefore , evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive .
As a precaution , the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies , including abacavir , and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors ( e . g . , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking ) .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS • The most commonly reported adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity ( incidence greater than or equal to 10 % ) in adult HIV - 1 clinical trials were nausea , headache , malaise and fatigue , nausea and vomiting , and dreams / sleep disorders .
( 6 . 1 ) • The most commonly reported adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity ( incidence greater than or equal to 5 % ) in pediatric HIV - 1 clinical trials were fever and / or chills , nausea and vomiting , skin rashes , and ear / nose / throat infections .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Serious and Fatal Abacavir - Associated Hypersensitivity Reactions In clinical trials , serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms : ( 1 ) fever ; ( 2 ) rash ; ( 3 ) gastrointestinal symptoms ( including nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or abdominal pain ) ; ( 4 ) constitutional symptoms ( including generalized malaise , fatigue , or achiness ) ; ( 5 ) respiratory symptoms ( including dyspnea , cough , or pharyngitis ) .
Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and / or rash as part of the syndrome .
Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy , headache , myalgia , edema , arthralgia , and paresthesia .
Anaphylaxis , liver failure , renal failure , hypotension , adult respiratory distress syndrome , respiratory failure , myolysis , and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions .
Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy , mucous membrane lesions ( conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations ) , and maculopapular or urticarial rash ( although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash ) .
There were reports of erythema multiforme .
Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries , elevated creatine phosphokinase , elevated creatinine , and lymphopenia , and abnormal chest x - ray findings ( predominantly infiltrates , which were localized ) .
Additional Adverse Reactions with Use of Abacavir sulfate Therapy - Naive Adults : Treatment - emergent clinical adverse reactions ( rated by the investigator as moderate or severe ) with a greater than or equal to 5 % frequency during therapy with abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily , lamivudine 150 mg twice daily , and efavirenz 600 mg daily compared with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily , lamivudine 150 mg twice daily , and efavirenz 600 mg daily from CNA30024 are listed in Table 2 .
Table 2 .
Treatment - Emergent ( All Causality ) Adverse Reactions of at Least Moderate Intensity ( Grades 2 - 4 , Greater than or Equal to 5 % Frequency ) in Therapy - Naive Adults ( CNA30024 [ 1 ] ) through 48 Weeks of Treatment Adverse Reaction Abacavir sulfate plus Lamivudine plus Efavirenz ( n = 324 ) Zidovudine plus Lamivudine plus Efavirenz ( n = 325 ) Dreams / sleep disorders 10 % 10 % Drug hypersensitivity 9 % < 1 % [ 2 ] Headaches / migraine 7 % 11 % Nausea 7 % 11 % Fatigue / malaise 7 % 10 % Diarrhea 7 % 6 % Rashes 6 % 12 % Abdominal pain / gastritis / gastrointestinal signs and symptoms 6 % 8 % Depressive disorders 6 % 6 % Dizziness 6 % 6 % Musculoskeletal pain 6 % 5 % Bronchitis 4 % 5 % Vomiting 2 % 9 % [ 1 ] This trial used double - blind ascertainment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions .
During the blinded portion of the trial , suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9 % of 324 subjects in the abacavir group and 3 % of 325 subjects in the zidovudine group .
[ 2 ] Ten ( 3 % ) cases of suspected drug hypersensitivity were reclassified as not being due to abacavir following unblinding Treatment - emergent clinical adverse reactions ( rated by the investigator as moderate or severe ) with a greater than or equal to 5 % frequency during therapy with abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily , lamivudine 150 mg twice daily , and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily compared with indinavir 800 mg 3 times daily , lamivudine 150 mg twice daily , and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily from CNA3005 are listed in Table 3 .
Table 3 .
Treatment - Emergent ( All Causality ) Adverse Reactions of at Least Moderate Intensity ( Grades 2 - 4 , Greater than or Equal to 5 % Frequency ) in Therapy - Naive Adults ( CNA3005 ) through 48 Weeks of Treatment Adverse Reaction Abacavir sulfate plus Lamivudine / Zidovudine ( n = 262 ) Indinavir plus Lamivudine / Zidovudine ( n = 264 ) Nausea 19 % 17 % Headache 13 % 9 % Malaise and fatigue 12 % 12 % Nausea and vomiting 10 % 10 % Hypersensitivity reaction 8 % 2 % Diarrhea 7 % 5 % Fever and / or chills 6 % 3 % Depressive disorders 6 % 4 % Musculoskeletal pain 5 % 7 % Skin rashes 5 % 4 % Ear / nose / throat infections 5 % 4 % Viral respiratory infections 5 % 5 % Anxiety 5 % 3 % Renal signs / symptoms < 1 % 5 % Pain ( non - site - specific ) < 1 % 5 % Five subjects receiving abacavir sulfate in CNA3005 experienced worsening of pre - existing depression compared with none in the indinavir arm .
The background rates of pre - existing depression were similar in the 2 treatment arms .
Abacavir sulfate Once Daily versus Abacavir sulfate Twice Daily ( CNA30021 ) : Treatment - emergent clinical adverse reactions ( rated by the investigator as at least moderate ) with a greater than or equal to 5 % frequency during therapy with abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily or abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily , both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily from CNA30021 , were similar .
For hypersensitivity reactions , subjects receiving abacavir sulfate once daily showed a rate of 9 % in comparison with a rate of 7 % for subjects receiving abacavir sulfate twice daily .
However , subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with subjects who received abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily .
Five percent ( 5 % ) of subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2 % of subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily .
Two percent ( 2 % ) of subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily had this event .
Laboratory Abnormalities : Laboratory abnormalities ( Grades 3 - 4 ) in therapy - naive adults during therapy with abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily , lamivudine 150 mg twice daily , and efavirenz 600 mg daily compared with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily , lamivudine 150 mg twice daily , and efavirenz 600 mg daily from CNA30024 are listed in Table 4 .

6 . 2 Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects Therapy - Experienced Pediatric Subjects ( Twice - Daily Dosing ) Treatment - emergent clinical adverse reactions ( rated by the investigator as moderate or severe ) with a greater than or equal to 5 % frequency during therapy with abacavir sulfate 8 mg per kg twice daily , lamivudine 4 mg per kg twice daily , and zidovudine 180 mg per m2 twice daily compared with lamivudine 4 mg per kg twice daily and zidovudine 180 mg per m2 twice daily from CNA3006 are listed in Table 6 .
Table 6 .
Treatment - Emergent ( All Causality ) Adverse Reactions of at Least Moderate Intensity ( Grades 2 - 4 , Greater than or Equal to 5 % Frequency ) in Therapy - Experienced Pediatric Subjects ( CNA3006 ) through 16 Weeks of Treatment Adverse Reaction Abacavir sulfate plus Lamivudine plus Zidovudine ( n = 102 ) Lamivudine plus Zidovudine ( n = 103 ) Fever and / or chills 9 % 7 % Nausea and vomiting 9 % 2 % Skin rashes 7 % 1 % Ear / nose / throat infections 5 % 1 % Pneumonia 4 % 5 % Headache 1 % 5 % Laboratory Abnormalities : In CNA3006 , laboratory abnormalities ( anemia , neutropenia , liver function test abnormalities , and CPK elevations ) were observed with similar frequencies as in a trial of therapy - naive adults ( CNA30024 ) .
Mild elevations of blood glucose were more frequent in pediatric subjects receiving abacavir sulfate ( CNA3006 ) as compared with adult subjects ( CNA30024 ) .
Other Adverse Events In addition to adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in Tables 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , other adverse reactions observed in the expanded access program were pancreatitis and increased GGT .
Pediatric Subjects Once - Daily versus Twice - Daily Dosing ( COL105677 ) : The safety of once - daily compared with twice - daily dosing of abacavir was assessed in the ARROW trial .
Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events .
The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once - daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice - daily dosing .
One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once - daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of abacavir sulfate .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposures .
Body as a Whole Redistribution / accumulation of body fat .
Cardiovascular Myocardial infarction .
Hepatic Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Skin Suspected Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN , respectively .
Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN , and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients , abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases .
There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Methadone : An increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients .
( 7 . 1 ) • Riociguat : The riociguat dose may need to be reduced .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Methadone In a trial of 11 HIV - 1 - infected subjects receiving methadone - maintenance therapy with 600 mg of abacavir sulfate twice daily ( twice the currently recommended dose ) , oral methadone clearance increased [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients ; however , an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients .
7 . 2 Riociguat Coadministration with fixed - dose abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine resulted in increased riociguat exposure , which may increase the risk of riociguat adverse reactions [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The riociguat dose may need to be reduced .
See full prescribing information for ADEMPAS ( riociguat ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Women infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed due to potential for HIV transmission .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to abacavir sulfate during pregnancy .
Healthcare Providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary Available data from the APR show no difference in the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background rate for birth defects of 2 . 7 % in the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) reference population ( see Data ) .
The APR uses the MACDP as the U . S . reference population for birth defects in the general population .
The MACDP evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks ' gestation .
The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR .
The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U . S . general population is 15 % to 20 % .
The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in fetal malformations and other embryonic and fetal toxicities at exposures 35 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended clinical daily dose .
However , no adverse developmental effects were observed following oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis , at exposures approximately 9 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended clinical dose ( see Data ) .
Data Human Data : Based on prospective reports to the APR of exposures to abacavir during pregnancy resulting in live births ( including over 1 , 300 exposed in the first trimester and over 1 , 300 exposed in second / third trimester ) , there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the MACDP .
The prevalence of defects in live births was 3 . 2 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 3 % to 4 . 3 % ) following first trimester exposure to abacavir - containing regimens and 2 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 1 % to 4 . 0 % ) following second / third trimester exposure to abacavir - containing regimens .
Abacavir has been shown to cross the placenta and concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Animal Data : Abacavir was administered orally to pregnant rats ( at 100 , 300 , and 1 , 000 mg per kg per day ) and rabbits ( at 125 , 350 , or 700 mg per kg per day ) during organogenesis ( on Gestation Days 6 through 17 and 6 through 20 , respectively ) .
Fetal malformations ( increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations ) or developmental toxicity ( decreased fetal body weight and crown - rump length ) were observed in rats at doses up to 1 , 000 mg per kg per day , resulting in exposures approximately 35 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended daily dose .
No developmental effects were observed in rats at 100 mg per kg per day , resulting in exposures ( AUC ) 3 . 5 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose .
In a fertility and early embryo - fetal development study conducted in rats ( at 60 , 160 , or 500 mg per kg per day ) , embryonic and fetal toxicities ( increased resorptions , decreased fetal body weights ) or toxicities to the offspring ( increased incidence of stillbirth and lower body weights ) occurred at doses up to 500 mg per kg per day .
No developmental effects were observed in rats at 60 mg per kg per day , resulting in exposures ( AUC ) approximately 4 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose .
Studies in pregnant rats showed that abacavir is transferred to the fetus through the placenta .
In pregnant rabbits , no developmental toxicities and no increases in fetal malformations occurred at up to the highest dose evaluated , resulting in exposures ( AUC ) approximately 9 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV - 1 - infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 infection .
Abacavir is present in human milk .
There is no information on the effects of abacavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Because of the potential for ( 1 ) HIV - 1 transmission ( in HIV - negative infants ) , ( 2 ) developing viral resistance ( in HIV - positive infants ) , and ( 3 ) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir tablets .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of abacavir sulfate have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older .
Use of abacavir sulfate is supported by pharmacokinetic trials and evidence from adequate and well - controlled trials of abacavir sulfate in adults and pediatric subjects [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of abacavir sulfate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir sulfate in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function A dose reduction is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
The safety , efficacy , and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment ; therefore , abacavir sulfate is contraindicated in these patients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known specific treatment for overdose with abacavir sulfate .
If overdose occurs , the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as required .
It is not known whether abacavir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis .
11 DESCRIPTION Abacavir sulfate is a synthetic carbocyclic nucleoside analogue with inhibitory activity against HIV - 1 .
The chemical name of abacavir sulfate is ( 1 S , cis ) - 4 - [ 2 - amino - 6 - ( cyclopropylamino ) - 9 H - purin - 9 - yl ] - 2 - cyclopentene - 1 - methanol sulfate ( salt ) ( 2 : 1 ) .
Abacavir sulfate is the enantiomer with 1 S , 4 R absolute configuration on the cyclopentene ring .
It has a molecular formula of ( C14H18N6O ) 2 • H2SO4 and a molecular weight of 670 . 76 g per mol .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Abacavir sulfate is a white to off - white solid and is soluble in water .
Abacavir tablets USP 300 mg are for oral administration .
Each tablet contains abacavir sulfate equivalent to 300 mg of abacavir as active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients : microcrystalline cellulose , sodium starch glycolate , corn starch , hypromellose , magnesium stearate , colloidal silicon dioxide and opadry yellow 15C52843 ( consist of hypromellose , titanium dioxide , polyethylene glycol , iron oxide yellow , polysorbate 80 ) .
In vivo , abacavir sulfate dissociates to its free base , abacavir .
Dosages are expressed in terms of abacavir .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Abacavir is an antiretroviral agent [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics in Adults The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir were independent of dose over the range of 300 to 1 , 200 mg per day .
Absorption : Following oral administration , abacavir is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed .
The geometric mean absolute bioavailability of the tablet was 83 % .
Plasma abacavir AUC was similar following administration of the oral solution or tablets .
After oral administration of 300 mg twice daily in 20 subjects , the steady - state peak serum abacavir concentration ( Cmax ) was 3 . 0 ± 0 . 89 mcg per mL ( mean ± SD ) and AUC ( 0 - 12 h ) was 6 . 02 ± 1 . 73 mcg • hour per mL .
After oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir in 20 subjects , Cmax was 4 . 26 ± 1 . 19 mcg per mL ( mean ± SD ) and AUC ¥ was 11 . 95 ± 2 . 51 mcg • hour per mL .
Effect of Food : Bioavailability of abacavir tablets was assessed in the fasting and fed states with no significant difference in systemic exposure ( AUC ∞ ) ; therefore , abacavir tablets may be administered with or without food .
Systemic exposure to abacavir was comparable after administration of abacavir oral solution and abacavir tablets .
Therefore , these products may be used interchangeably .
Distribution : The apparent volume of distribution after IV administration of abacavir was 0 . 86 ± 0 . 15 L per kg , suggesting that abacavir distributes into extravascular space .
In 3 subjects , the CSF AUC ( 0 - 6 h ) to plasma abacavir AUC ( 0 - 6 h ) ratio ranged from 27 % to 33 % .
Binding of abacavir to human plasma proteins is approximately 50 % and was independent of concentration .
Total blood and plasma drug - related radioactivity concentrations are identical , demonstrating that abacavir readily distributes into erythrocytes .
Elimination : In single - dose trials , the observed elimination half - life ( t ½ ) was 1 . 54 ± 0 . 63 hours .
After intravenous administration , total clearance was 0 . 80 ± 0 . 24 L per hour per kg ( mean ± SD ) .
Metabolism : In humans , abacavir is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes .
The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase to form the 5 ¢ - carboxylic acid and glucuronyl transferase to form the 5 ¢ - glucuronide .
The metabolites do not have antiviral activity .
In vitro experiments reveal that abacavir does not inhibit human CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , or CYP2C9 activity at clinically relevant concentrations .
Excretion : Elimination of abacavir was quantified in a mass balance trial following administration of a 600 - mg dose of 14 C - abacavir : 99 % of the radioactivity was recovered , 1 . 2 % was excreted in the urine as abacavir , 30 % as the 5 ¢ - carboxylic acid metabolite , 36 % as the 5 ¢ - glucuronide metabolite , and 15 % as unidentified minor metabolites in the urine .
Fecal elimination accounted for 16 % of the dose .
Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment : The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir sulfate have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function .
Renal excretion of unchanged abacavir is a minor route of elimination in humans .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in subjects with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A ) .
Results showed that there was a mean increase of 89 % in the abacavir AUC and an increase of 58 % in the half - life of abacavir after a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir .
The AUCs of the metabolites were not modified by mild liver disease ; however , the rates of formation and elimination of the metabolites were decreased [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Pregnant Women : Abacavir pharmacokinetics were studied in 25 pregnant women during the last trimester of pregnancy receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily .
Abacavir exposure ( AUC ) during pregnancy was similar to those in postpartum and in HIV - infected non - pregnant historical controls .
Consistent with passive diffusion of abacavir across the placenta , abacavir concentrations in neonatal plasma cord samples at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery .
Pediatric Patients : The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied after either single or repeat doses of abacavir sulfate in 169 pediatric subjects .
Subjects receiving abacavir oral solution according to the recommended dosage regimen achieved plasma concentrations of abacavir similar to adults .
Subjects receiving abacavir oral tablets achieved higher plasma concentrations of abacavir than subjects receiving oral solution .
The pharmacokinetics of abacavir dosed once daily in HIV - 1 - infected pediatric subjects aged 3 months through 12 years was evaluated in 3 trials ( PENTA 13 [ n = 14 ] , PENTA 15 [ n = 18 ] , and ARROW [ n = 36 ] ) .
All 3 trials were 2 - period , crossover , open - label pharmacokinetic trials of twice - versus once - daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine .
For the oral solution as well as the tablet formulation , these 3 trials demonstrated that once - daily dosing provides comparable AUC0 - 24 to twice - daily dosing of abacavir at the same total daily dose .
The mean Cmax was approximately 1 . 6 - to 2 . 3 - fold higher with abacavir once - daily dosing compared with twice - daily dosing .
Geriatric Patients : The pharmacokinetics of abacavir sulfate have not been studied in subjects older than 65 years .
Male and Female Patients : A population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV - 1 - infected male ( n = 304 ) and female ( n = 67 ) subjects showed no gender differences in abacavir AUC normalized for lean body weight .
Racial Groups : There are no significant or clinically relevant racial differences between blacks and whites in abacavir pharmacokinetics .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Abacavir on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents : In vitro studies have shown that abacavir has potential to inhibit CYP1A1 and limited potential to inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4 .
Abacavir did not inhibit or induce other CYP enzymes ( such as CYP2C9 , or CYP2D6 ) .
Based on in vitro study results , abacavir at therapeutic drug exposures is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of the following transporters : organic anion transporter polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 / 3 , breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) or Pglycoprotein ( P - gp ) , organic cation transporter ( OCT ) 1 , OCT2 , or multidrug and toxic extrusion protein ( MATE ) 1 and MATE2 - K .
Riociguat : Coadministration of a single dose of riociguat ( 0 . 5 mg ) to HIV - 1 – infected subjects receiving fixed - dose abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine is reported to increase riociguat AUC ( ∞ ) compared with riociguat AUC ( ∞ ) reported in healthy subjects due to CYP1A1 inhibition by abacavir .
The exact magnitude of increase in riociguat exposure has not been fully characterized based on findings from two studies [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Abacavir : In vitro , abacavir is not a substrate of OATP1B1 , OAP1B3 , OCT1 , OCT2 , OAT1 , MATE1 , MATE2 - K , multidrug resistance - associated protein ( MRP ) 2 or MRP4 ; therefore , drugs that modulate these transporters are not expected to affect abacavir plasma concentrations .
Abacavir is a substrate of BCRP and P - gp in vitro ; however , considering its absolute bioavailability ( 83 % ) , modulators of these transporters are unlikely to result in a clinically relevant impact on abacavir concentrations .
Lamivudine and / or Zidovudine : Fifteen HIV - 1 - infected subjects were enrolled in a crossover - designed drug interaction trial evaluating single doses of abacavir ( 600 mg ) , lamivudine ( 150 mg ) , and zidovudine ( 300 mg ) alone or in combination .
Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine .
Lamivudine exposure ( AUC decreased 15 % ) and zidovudine exposure ( AUC increased 10 % ) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir .
Ethanol : Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol .
Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure .
Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and ethanol via alcohol dehydrogenase , the pharmacokinetic interaction between abacavir and ethanol was studied in 24 HIV - 1 - infected male subjects .
Each subject received the following treatments on separate occasions : a single 600 - mg dose of abacavir , 0 . 7 g per kg ethanol ( equivalent to 5 alcoholic drinks ) , and abacavir 600 mg plus 0 . 7 g per kg ethanol .
Coadministration of ethanol and abacavir resulted in a 41 % increase in abacavir AUC ∞ and a 26 % increase in abacavir t1 / 2 .
Abacavir had no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol , so no clinically significant interaction is expected in men .
This interaction has not been studied in females .
Methadone : In a trial of 11 HIV - 1 - infected subjects receiving methadone - maintenance therapy ( 40 mg and 90 mg daily ) , with 600 mg of abacavir sulfate twice daily ( twice the currently recommended dose ) , oral methadone clearance increased 22 % ( 90 % CI : 6 % to 42 % ) .
This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients ; however , an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
The addition of methadone had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir 12 . 4 Microbiology Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue .
Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite , carbovir triphosphate ( CBV - TP ) , an analogue of deoxyguanosine - 5 ′ - triphosphate ( dGTP ) .
CBV - TP inhibits the activity of HIV - 1 reverse transcriptase ( RT ) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA .
Antiviral Activity The antiviral activity of abacavir against HIV - 1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including primary monocytes / macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) .
EC50 values ranged from 3 . 7 to 5 . 8 microM ( 1 microM = 0 . 28 mcg per mL ) and 0 . 07 to 1 . 0 microM against HIV - 1 IIIB and HIV - 1 BaL , respectively , and the mean EC50 value was 0 . 26 ± 0 . 18 microM against 8 clinical isolates .
The median EC50 values of abacavir were 344 nM ( range : 14 . 8 to 676 nM ) , 16 . 9 nM ( range : 5 . 9 to 27 . 9 nM ) , 8 . 1 nM ( range : 1 . 5 to 16 . 7 nM ) , 356 nM ( range : 35 . 7 to 396 nM ) , 105 nM ( range : 28 . 1 to 168 nM ) , 47 . 6 nM ( range : 5 . 2 to 200 nM ) , 51 . 4 nM ( range : 7 . 1 to 177 nM ) , and 282 nM ( range : 22 . 4 to 598 nM ) against HIV - 1 clades A - G and group O viruses ( n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B ) , respectively .
The EC50 values against HIV - 2 isolates ( n = 4 ) , ranged from 0 . 024 to 0 . 49 microM .
The antiviral activity of abacavir in cell culture was not antagonized when combined with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , zalcitabine or zidovudine , the non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) nevirapine , or the protease inhibitor ( PI ) amprenavir .
Ribavirin ( 50 microM ) used in the treatment of chronic HCV infection had no effect on the anti – HIV - 1 activity of abacavir in cell culture .
Resistance HIV - 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to abacavir have been selected in cell culture .
Genotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from abacavir - treated subjects demonstrated that amino acid substitutions K65R , L74V , Y115F , and M184V / I emerged in HIV - 1 RT .
M184V or I substitutions resulted in an approximately 2 - fold decrease in susceptibility to abacavir .
Substitutions K65R , L74M , or Y115F with M184V or I conferred a 7 - to 8 - fold reduction in abacavir susceptibility , and combinations of three substitutions were required to confer more than an 8 - fold reduction in susceptibility .
Thirty - nine percent ( 7 of 18 ) of the isolates from subjects who experienced virologic failure in the abacavir once - daily arm had a greater than 2 . 5 - fold mean decrease in abacavir susceptibility with a median - fold decrease of 1 . 3 ( range : 0 . 5 to 11 ) compared with 29 % ( 5 of 17 ) of the failure isolates in the twice - daily arm with a median - fold decrease of 0 . 92 ( range : 0 . 7 to 13 ) .
Cross - Resistance Cross - resistance has been observed among NRTIs .
Isolates containing abacavir resistance - associated substitutions , namely , K65R , L74V , Y115F , and M184V , exhibited cross - resistance to didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , and tenofovir in cell culture and in subjects .
An increasing number of thymidine analogue mutation substitutions ( TAMs : M41L , D67N , K70R , L210W , T215Y / F , K219E / R / H / Q / N ) is associated with a progressive reduction in abacavir susceptibility .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Abacavir was administered orally at 3 dosage levels to separate groups of mice and rats in 2 - year carcinogenicity studies .
Results showed an increase in the incidence of malignant and non - malignant tumors .
Malignant tumors occurred in the preputial gland of males and the clitoral gland of females of both species , and in the liver of female rats .
In addition , non - malignant tumors also occurred in the liver and thyroid gland of female rats .
These observations were made at systemic exposures in the range of 6 to 32 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 600 mg .
Mutagenicity Abacavir induced chromosomal aberrations both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human lymphocytes .
Abacavir was mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation , although it was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay .
Abacavir was clastogenic in males and not clastogenic in females in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Abacavir was not mutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity assays in the presence and absence of metabolic activation .
Impairment of Fertility Abacavir did not affect male or female fertility in rats at a dose associated with exposures ( AUC ) approximately 3 . 3 times ( male ) or 4 . 1 times ( female ) those in humans at the clinically recommended dose .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Myocardial degeneration was found in mice and rats following administration of abacavir for 2 years .
The systemic exposures were equivalent to 7 to 24 times the expected systemic exposure in humans at a dose of 600 mg .
The clinical relevance of this finding has not been determined .
