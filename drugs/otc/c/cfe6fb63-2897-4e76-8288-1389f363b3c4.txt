YOU ’ RE READY TO START .
Okay , you ’ re ready .
To become a non - smoker , start today .
Now before you do anything else , you have a bit of planning to do .
Read this User ’ s Guide all the way through .
You want to make sure you bought the right dose to start .
If you typically smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up , use the 4 mg Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges .
If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up , use the 2 mg Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges .
Next , plan your quitting schedule .
Get a calendar to follow your progress and mark the following four important dates ( see the reminders on the upper left of this User ’ s Guide ) .
THE PROGRAM STEP 1 .
( Weeks 1 to 6 ) Starting on your quit date it ’ s best to use at least 9 Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges each day , one every 1 to 2 hours .
First choose the day you plan to quit ( make it soon ) .
Place the Step 1 reminder on this date .
That ’ s the day you will start using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges to calm your cravings for nicotine and help you stay smoke - free .
Prior to the quit date , get rid of all your cigarettes to remove temptations and make it more difficult to start smoking again .
Use a Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge every 1 to 2 hours and at least 9 lozenges each day for the first 6 weeks to help prevent unexpected cravings and improve your chances of quitting .
These aren ’ t ordinary lozenges .
Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve .
Minimize swallowing .
Do not chew or swallow the lozenge .
You may feel a warm or tingling sensation .
Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other until completely dissolved .
Remember to read the “ USING NICOTINE POLACRILEX mini LOZENGES PROPERLY ” section before you take your first Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge .
STEP 2 .
( The next three weeks , that is weeks 7 to 9 ) .
At the beginning of week 7 start using fewer Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges , one every 2 to 4 hours .
After six weeks , you should wait a little longer between lozenges , one lozenge every two to four hours .
This will help you gradually use fewer Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges .
Put the Step 2 reminder on the first day of week 7 to help remind you when to start reducing the number of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges you take .
STEP 3 .
( The last three weeks , that is weeks 10 to 12 ) .
At the beginning of week 10 , reduce Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge use even further , one every 4 to 8 hours .
At the beginning of week 10 further decrease the number of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges you use each day to reduce the amount of nicotine you get .
You should do this by using one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours .
Put the Step 3 reminder on the first day of week 10 so you know when you should be starting this last step to becoming smoke and nicotine - free .
END .
At the end of week 12 you ’ ll complete Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge therapy .
Put the “ EX - SMOKER ” reminder on your calendar on the date 12 weeks after the day you stopped smoking and started using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges .
BE PREPARED .
Since smoking is an addiction , it is hard to quit .
Even after you stop , there will be times when you WANT a cigarette , sometimes strongly ( see also section on “ CHALLENGES TO WATCH FOR ” ) .
The best defense is to be prepared .
Plan now for handling tough times so you don ’ t give in .
Think about situations where you usually get an urge to smoke or where you might experience strong urges to smoke ( for example , spending time with smokers or drinking alcohol — try to avoid these situations if those things tempt you to smoke ) .
Change your habits .
For example , take your coffee break somewhere else .
Take a walk .
In other words , break the association between your usual habits and cigarettes .
If you do encounter a situation where you feel a strong urge to smoke , fight it !
Take a break from the situation ; keep yourself busy or distracted with other activities .
Remind yourself why you want to quit , and above all , remind yourself that having “ just one ” really will hurt your goal of quitting !
Assemble a “ survival package ” — items that can keep you distracted in case you get an urge to smoke .
For example , cinnamon gum or hard candy , relaxing music , things to keep your hands busy like a smooth stone or paper clips , etc .
Track your quit progress .
Use a journal to note if and when you get an urge to smoke .
Note how many pieces of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges you use each day .
If you slip and have a cigarette , don ’ t give up .
Stop smoking again and get back on your program with Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges .
Establish your support network .
Keep friends ’ and family members ’ phone numbers ready to get the moral support you need .
Before quitting , ask friends and family to support and encourage you .
Think of specific ways they can help .
Reward yourself .
Set aside little gifts to encourage yourself which you can earn by overcoming difficult hurdles .
HOW NICOTINE POLACRILEX mini LOZENGES WORK .
Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges are a form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy .
They deliver nicotine to your body , temporarily relieving craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms when you quit smoking .
But unlike cigarettes , Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges deliver a lower , steady level of nicotine to your blood .
When used as directed , Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges help you regulate , control , and gradually reduce your body ’ s craving for nicotine .
The good news is that Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges contain no tar or carbon monoxide , and therefore don ’ t present the same medical risks as cigarettes .
However , the lozenges still deliver nicotine , the addictive ingredient in cigarettes .
And for some people the nicotine in Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges can occasionally cause mouth or throat irritation , headaches , nausea , hiccups , upset stomach or dizziness .
USING NICOTINE POLACRILEX mini LOZENGES PROPERLY .
Remember , Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges aren ’ t like ordinary lozenges such as cough drops .
This lozenge is designed to deliver nicotine into your system through the lining of your mouth , not in your stomach like most other medicines .
It is important to minimize swallowing the dissolved medicine in these lozenges so that it can be properly absorbed in your mouth .
Do not use more than one lozenge at a time , or many lozenges one after another since this can cause hiccups , heartburn , nausea or other side effects .
Read all the following instructions before using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges .
Refer to them often to make sure you ’ re using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges correctly .
IMPORTANT : Don ’ t worry or give up if you do not like the taste of the lozenge at first .
Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges are a medication , not a candy .
Most people get used to the taste after a day or two .
Remember , staying with the plan will help you quit .
Begin using Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges on your quit date .
1 ) Remove the Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge from the immediate container .
Place the lozenge in your mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve .
Minimize swallowing .
Do not chew or swallow the lozenge .
You may feel a warm or tingling sensation .
2 ) Occasionally move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other side until completely dissolved .
To reduce cravings or urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms , use Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges according to the following dosage schedule : Weeks 1 through 6 Weeks 7 through 9 Weeks 10 through 12 1 lozenge every 1 to 2 hours 1 lozenge every 2 to 4 hours 1 lozenge every 4 to 8 hours Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 hours .
Do not use more than 20 lozenges per day .
At the end of 12 weeks ( 3 months ) you will have completed treatment .
FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF QUITTING , use Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges on a regular schedule , using at least 9 lozenges a day during the first 6 weeks .
That will help your body better adjust to the lack of cigarettes and better help prevent cravings .
Some people may need more lozenges to reduce their cravings .
Do not exceed the recommended maximum daily dosage of 20 lozenges per day .
Do not continuously use one lozenge after another , since this may cause you hiccups , heartburn , nausea or other side effects .

So , as the above schedule indicates , you should gradually reduce the amount of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges you take per day .
Some people find it easier to reduce by substituting ordinary sweets or sugar - free candy for some of the Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges they would normally use .

It is important to complete treatment .

MAKE QUITTING EASIER ON YOURSELF .
Soon after your quit date , parties , bars , celebrations , and socializing may all tempt you to smoke .
Please remember these tips to help you resist those urges and stay smoke - free .
The Day You Quit Smoking : • Look to your family and friends for support .
Let them know what to do or avoid doing to help you quit .
• Throw away ALL cigarettes , ashtrays , matches , lighters .
You don ’ t need them .
You don ’ t want them and you want to make it difficult to go back .
• Keep yourself occupied .
Take a walk .
See a movie .
See friends .
Do anything to keep your mind off cigarettes .
• Calculate all the money you ’ ll save by not buying cigarettes .
Probably well over $ 1 , 000 a year !
$ 1 , 000 a year ?
Think of what you can spend it on !
• Know what situations are going to make you want to smoke .
Plan now how you ’ ll avoid them or deal with them so you don ’ t smoke .
• Keep Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges next to your bed so you ’ re prepared when you get up .
A lot of people get cravings first thing in the morning .
• Make an appointment to see your dentist and get the tobacco stains cleaned off .
While you ’ re getting rid of the evidence of cigarettes in the house , do the same for your teeth .
Have clothes or drapes that smell of smoking cleaned .
• Now that your house is smoke - free , try to spend most of your time in smoke - free environments .
• If you usually smoked with coffee or alcohol , try to keep away from them for now .
Remember you are also trying to break a habit .
• Smoking is a “ hands - on ” habit .
So use something else to occupy your hands : a rubber band or a pen .
• Now ’ s a good time to get active .
Find activities to take your mind off cigarettes and relax .
Take up jogging , swimming , or walking .
• Don ’ t stress out about gaining weight .
Dieting now may weaken your efforts to quit smoking .
Eat sensibly and exercise daily ; drink large quantities of water and fruit juices ; this can help your chances of staying smoke - free .
• Laugh .
Watch a sitcom .
Read a comic book .
It really helps .
REMEMBER : Urges to smoke are temporary .
They ’ ll pass , even if you don ’ t smoke .
WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT .
As you are successful at staying smoke - free , initially you will probably notice a few of the following typical withdrawal symptoms , so don ’ t be surprised .
Use of Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges reduces these symptoms , but may not eliminate them entirely .
They will go away with time .
Stay focused on your goal of becoming an ex - smoker .
Research shows that if you manage to avoid all smoking in the first week ( that means not having a single puff ) , your chances of success increase dramatically .
The First Few Days .
You may feel nervous or irritable or have difficulty concentrating during the first few days after you quit smoking .
Your body needs time to regain balance .
Initially , you might feel a little out of sorts , get headaches , feel light - headed , or have trouble sleeping .
Your smoker ’ s cough may get worse before it improves .
But fear not , it ’ s a positive sign .
Coughing helps clean your lungs of the tar residue you got from smoking .
After a Couple of Weeks .
Your confidence and ability to cope with urges to smoke should be getting stronger .
But don ’ t be over - confident and think you can smoke just one cigarette .
Even now , having even a single puff can lead to a return to smoking cigarettes regularly .
Be prepared , and remember why you wanted to stop smoking .
Have you noticed that your sense of taste and smell has improved ?
You are probably coughing less and finding it easier to breathe .
You ’ ve also probably noticed your withdrawal symptoms are subsiding ( though don ’ t worry if they ’ re still there : they last longer for some people ) .
These are all positive signs that your body is getting used to your success at stopping smoking .
By The End of The First Month .
You are less likely to have cravings for cigarettes as often .
However sudden cravings may still happen , and when they do , be on your guard , as they can be strong and seem to come out of the blue .
Be prepared for these challenging times .
The key is do what you can so these unexpected cravings can ’ t beat you .
Keep focused on the ways non - smokers are more attractive than smokers .
Their breath smells better .
Their clothes and hair are fresher .
Their teeth are cleaner and brighter .
Their skin is less likely to wrinkle .
Not smoking around children and your friends is also healthier for them too .
WHAT IF YOU DO SLIP AND SMOKE ?
“ What if I relapse ? ”
One cigarette is a slip - up , but it ’ s not the end of the quit effort .
Everybody slips at something .
The key is this : forgive yourself and stop at that one cigarette .
Don ’ t let this slip ruin your good intentions , keep at your quit attempt .
So , throw out your cigarettes and continue with your quit attempt , keeping in mind what went wrong and led to the slip .
If you do go back to smoking , certainly don ’ t throw out your Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges .
Keep them for the next time you ’ re ready to quit .
In fact research says that even if you are back to smoking regularly the best thing you can do is learn and try again .
Try to understand the reason you had those cigarettes that made you slip .
That ’ s important , because now you can plan better to deal with these moments next time .
It ’ s true you stumbled , but don ’ t think of yourself as having failed .
Encourage yourself by treating the last attempt as a learning experience , even a “ trial run ” for the real thing .
Take a look at the usage instructions and check that you used the Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenges correctly and for the full 12 weeks of the program .
When you try again make sure you use enough and the right way .
That way you ’ ll be best equipped to deal with the unexpected cravings .
Don ’ t forget ; quitting isn ’ t easy and it takes practice to do anything .
Stopping smoking is no different .
YOU ’ VE MADE IT .
Once your twelve week quitting program is over , you ’ ve taken your last Nicotine Polacrilex mini Lozenge .
Now you are both cigarette and nicotine - free .
Get up and give yourself a standing ovation .
We mean it .
Do you realize that you have just done a really difficult thing ?
Now ’ s a good time to think back on the process .
Think of all your reasons for quitting smoking .
Think of your goals .
Think of how they ’ re going to be a reality now .
Think of what you ’ re going to do with your newly liberated cigarette money .
The places you can now go smoke - free .
Think of the extra time you may have added to your life and what you can do with it .
And although you may still experience the occasional temptation , and cigarettes still want you back , think positively .
Think forward .
And consider yourself a proud non - smoker .
