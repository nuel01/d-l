For Oral Inhalation Only DESCRIPTION : NebuPent ( pentamidine isethionate ) , an antifungal agent , is a nonpyrogenic lyophilized product .
After reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection , USP , NebuPent is administered by inhalation via the Respirgard ® II nebulizer [ Marquest , Englewood , CO ] ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Pentamidine isethionate , 4 , 4 ’ - [ 1 , 5 - pentane - diylbis ( oxy ) ] bis - benzenecarboximidamid , is a white crystalline powder soluble in water and glycerin and insoluble in ether , acetone , and chloroform .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] C19H24N4O2 • 2C2H6O4S 592 . 68 Each vial contains 300 mg pentamidine isethionate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Microbiology Mechanism of Action Studies suggest that the pentamidine isethionate interferes with microbial nuclear metabolism by inhibition of DNA , RNA , phospholipid and protein synthesis .
However , the mode of action is not fully understood .
Activity in vitro and in vivo Pentamidine isethionate , an aromatic diamidine , is known to have activity against Pneumocystis jiroveci .
Pharmacokinetics In 5 AIDS patients with suspected Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia ( PJP ) , the mean concentrations of pentamidine determined 18 to 24 hours after inhalation therapy were 23 . 2 ng / mL ( range 5 . 1 to 43 . 0 ng / mL ) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and 705 ng / mL ( range 140 to 1336 ng / mL ) in sediment after administration of a 300 mg single dose via the Respirgard ® II nebulizer .
In 3 AIDS patients with suspected PJP , the mean concentrations of pentamidine determined 18 to 24 hours after a 4 mg / kg intravenous dose were 2 . 6 ng / mL ( range 1 . 5 to 4 . 0 ng / mL ) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and 9 . 3 ng / mL ( range 6 . 9 to 12 . 8 ng / mL ) in sediment .
In the patients who received aerosolized pentamidine , the peak plasma levels of pentamidine were at or below the lower limit of detection of the assay ( 2 . 3 ng / mL ) .
Following a single 2 - hour intravenous infusion of 4 mg / kg of pentamidine isethionate to 6 AIDS patients , the mean plasma Cmax , T 1 / 2 and clearance were 612 ± 371 ng / mL , 6 . 4 ± 1 . 3 hr and 248 ± 91 L / hr respectively .
In another study of aerosolized pentamidine in 13 AIDS patients with acute PJP who received 4 mg / kg / day administered via the Ultra Vent ® jet nebulizer , peak plasma levels of pentamidine averaged 18 . 8 ± 11 . 9 ng / mL after the first dose .
During the next 14 days of repeated dosing , the highest observed Cmax averaged 20 . 5 ± 21 . 2 ng / mL .
In a third study , following daily administration of 600 mg of inhaled pentamidine isethionate with the Respirgard ® II nebulizer for 21 days in 11 patients with acute PJP , mean plasma levels measured shortly after the 21 st dose averaged 11 . 8 ± 10 . 0 ng / mL .
Plasma concentrations after aerosol administration are substantially lower than those observed after a comparable intravenous dose .
The extent of pentamidine accumulation and distribution following chronic inhalation therapy are not known .
In rats , intravenous administration of a 5 mg / kg dose resulted in concentrations of pentamidine in the liver and kidney that were 87 . 5 and 62 . 3 - fold higher , respectively , than levels in those organs following 5 mg / kg administered as an aerosol .
No pharmacokinetic data are available following aerosol administration of pentamidine in humans with impaired hepatic or renal function .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE : NebuPent is indicated for the prevention of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia ( PJP ) in high - risk , HIV - infected patients defined by one or both of the following criteria : i . a history of one or more episodes of PJP ii .
a peripheral CD4 + ( T4 helper / inducer ) lymphocyte count less than or equal to 200 / mm3 .
These indications are based on the results of an 18 - month randomized , dose - response trial in high risk HIV - infected patients and on existing epidemiological data from natural history studies .
The patient population of the controlled trial consisted of 408 patients , 237 of whom had a history of one or more episodes of PJP .
The remaining patients without a history of PJP included 55 patients with Kaposi ’ s sarcoma and 116 patients with other AIDS diagnoses , ARC or asymptomatic HIV infection .
Patients were randomly assigned to receive NebuPent via the Respirgard ® II nebulizer at one of the following three doses : 30 mg every two weeks ( n = 135 ) , 150 mg every two weeks ( n = 134 ) or 300 mg every four weeks ( n = 139 ) .
The results of the trial demonstrated a significant protective effect ( p < 0 . 01 ) against PJP with the 300 mg every four week dosage regimen compared to the 30 mg every two week dosage regimen .
The 300 mg dose regimen reduced the risk of developing PJP by 50 to 70 % compared to the 30 mg regimen .
A total of 293 patients ( 72 % of all patients ) also received zidovudine at sometime during the trial .
The analysis of the data demonstrated the efficacy of the 300 mg dose even after adjusting for the effect of zidovudine .
The results of the trial further demonstrate that the dose and frequency of dosing are important to the efficacy of NebuPent prophylaxis in that multiple analyses consistently demonstrated a trend toward greater efficacy with 300 mg every four weeks as compared to 150 mg every two weeks .
No dose - response was observed for reduction in overall mortality ; however , mortality from PJP was low in all three dosage groups .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : NebuPent is contraindicated in patients with a history of an anaphylactic reaction to inhaled or parenteral pentamidine isethionate .
WARNINGS : The potential for development of acute PJP still exists in patients receiving NebuPent prophylaxis .
Therefore , any patient with symptoms suggestive of the presence of a pulmonary infection , including but not limited to dyspnea , fever or cough , should receive a thorough medical evaluation and appropriate diagnostic tests for possible acute PJP as well as for other opportunistic and nonopportunistic pathogens .
The use of NebuPent may alter the clinical and radiographic features of PJP and could result in an atypical presentation , including but not limited to mild disease or focal infection .
Prior to initiating NebuPent prophylaxis , symptomatic patients should be evaluated appropriately to exclude the presence of PJP .
The recommended dose of NebuPent for the prevention of PJP is insufficient to treat acute PJP .
PRECAUTIONS : IMPORTANT : DO NOT MIX THE NEBUPENT SOLUTION WITH ANY OTHER DRUGS .
DO NOT USE THE RESPIRGARD ® II NEBULIZER TO ADMINISTER A BRONCHODILATOR .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Pulmonary Inhalation of NebuPent may induce bronchospasm or cough .
This has been noted particularly in some patients who have a history of smoking or asthma .
In clinical trials , cough and bronchospasm were the most frequently reported adverse experiences associated with NebuPent administration ( 38 % and 15 % , respectively of patients receiving the 300 mg dose ) ; however less than 1 % of the doses were interrupted or terminated due to these effects .
For the majority of patients , cough and bronchospasm were controlled by administration of an aerosolized bronchodilator ( only 1 % of patients withdrew from the study due to treatment - associated cough or bronchospasm ) .
In patients who experience bronchospasm or cough , administration of an inhaled bronchodilator prior to giving each NebuPent dose may minimize recurrence of the symptoms .
General The extent and consequence of pentamidine accumulation following chronic inhalation therapy are not known .
As a result , patients receiving NebuPent should be closely monitored for the development of serious adverse reactions that have occurred in patients receiving parenteral pentamidine , including hypotension , hypogly cemia , hyperglycemia , hypocalcemia , anemia , thrombocytopenia , leukopenia , hepatic or renal dysfunction , ventricular tachycardia , pancre atitis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , hyperkalemia and abnormal ST segment of ECG .
Extrapulmonary infection with P . jiroveci has been reported infrequently .
Most , but not all , of the cases have been reported in patients who have a history of PJP .
The presence of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis should be considered when evaluating patients with unexplained signs and symptoms .
Cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported in patients receiving aerosolized pentamidine .
NebuPent should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of acute pancreatitis develop .
Drug Interactions While specific studies on drug interactions with NebuPent have not been conducted , the majority of patients in clinical trials received concomitant medications , including zidovudine , with no reported interactions .
Because the nephrotoxic effects may be additive , the concomitant or sequential use of NebuPent and other nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides , amphotericin B , cisplatin , foscarnet , or vancomycin should be closely monitored and avoided , if possible .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Literature reports indicate that pentamidine was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial ( S . typhimurium ) test and did not induce an increase in chromosomal aberrations in Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cell or in human lymphocytes in vitro .
No studies have been conducted to determine effects of pentamidine isethionate on carcinogenicity or fertility .
Pregnancy - Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well controlled studies of NebuPent in pregnant women .
A literature report indicated that intravenously administered pentamidine in pregnant rats at 4 mg / kg / day was embryolethal ; teratogenicity was not observed in this study .
It is unknown whether pentamidine administered via the aerosolized route crosses the placenta at clinically significant concentrations .
It is not known whether NebuPent can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
NebuPent should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether NebuPent is excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from NebuPent , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , NebuPent should not be given to a nursing mother unless the potential benefits are judged to outweigh the unknown risks .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of NebuPent in pediatric patients ( birth to 16 years of age ) have not been established .

OVERDOSAGE : Overdosage has not been reported with NebuPent .
The symptoms and signs of overdosage are not known .
A serious overdosage , to the point of producing systemic drug levels similar to those following parenteral administration , would have the potential of producing similar types of serious systemic toxicity .
( See PRECAUTIONS ) .
Available clinical pharmacology data ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) suggest that a dose up to 40 times the recommended NebuPent dosage would be required to produce systemic levels similar to a single 4 mg / kg intravenous dose .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : IMPORTANT : NEBUPENT MUST BE DISSOLVED ONLY IN STERILE WATER FOR INJECTION , USP .
DO NOT USE SALINE SOLUTION FOR RECONSTITUTION BECAUSE THE DRUG WILL PRECIPITATE .
DO NOT MIX THE NEBUPENT SOLUTION WITH ANY OTHER DRUGS .
