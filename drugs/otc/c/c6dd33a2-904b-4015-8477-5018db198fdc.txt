CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Gentamicin sulfate is a wide spectrum antibiotic that provides highly effective topical treatment in primary and secondary bacterial infections of the skin .
Gentamicin Sulfate Ointment may clear infections that have not responded to treatment with other topical antibiotic agents .
In primary skin infections such as impetigo contagiosa , treatment 3 or 4 times daily with Gentamicin Sulfate Ointment usually clears the lesions promptly .
In secondary infections , Gentamicin Sulfate Ointment aids in the treatment of the underlying dermatoses by controlling the infection .
Bacteria susceptible to the action of gentamicin sulfate include sensitive strains of Streptococci ( group A beta - hemolytic , alpha - hemolytic ) , Staphylococcus aureus ( coagulase positive , coagulase negative , and some penicillinase - producing strains ) , and the gram - negative bacteria , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Aerobacter aerogenes , Escherichia coli , Proteus vulgaris , and Kiebsiella pneumoniae .

Please Note : Gentamicin sulfate is a bactericidal agent that is not effective against viruses or fungi in skin infections .
Gentamicin sulfate is useful in the treatment of infected skin cysts and certain other skin abscesses when preceded by incision and drainage to permit adequate contact between the antibiotic and the infecting bacteria .
Good results have been obtained in the treatment of infected stasis and other skin ulcers , infected superficial burns , paronychia , infected insect bites and stings , infected lacerations and abrasions , and wounds from minor surgery .
Patients sensitive to neomycin can be treated with gentamicin sulfate , although regular observation of patients sensitive to topical antibiotics is advisable when such patients are treated with any topical antibiotic .

There was no evidence of irritation or sensitization , however , in any of these patients patch - tested subsequently with gentamicin sulfate on normal skin .
Possible photosensitization has been reported in several patients but could not be elicited in these patients by reapplication of gentamicin sulfate followed by exposure to ultraviolet radiation .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : A small amount of Gentamicin Sulfate Ointment should be applied gently to the lesions three or four times daily .
