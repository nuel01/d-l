Reactions to Temozolomide have included anaphylaxis [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
• History of hypersensitivity to temozolomide or any other ingredients in Temozolomide Capsules USP and dacarbazine .
( 4 . 1 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myelosuppression : Monitor absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) and platelet count prior to each cycle and during treatment .
Geriatric patients and women have a higher risk of developing myelosuppression .
( 5 . 1 ) • Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Secondary Malignancies , including myeloid leukemia , have been observed .
( 5 . 2 ) • Pneumocystis Pneumonia ( PCP ) : Closely monitor all patients , particularly those receiving steroids , for the development of lymphopenia and PCP .
( 5 . 3 ) • Hepatotoxicity : Fatal and severe hepatotoxicity have been reported .
Perform liver tests at baseline , midway through the first cycle , prior to each subsequent cycle , and approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the last dose of temozolomide .
• Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception .
Advise male patients with pregnant partners or female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms .
( 5 . 5 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression , including pancytopenia , leukopenia and anemia , some with fatal outcomes , have occurred with Temozolomide [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 ) ] .
Geriatric patients and women have been shown in clinical trials to have a higher risk of developing myelosuppression .
Prior to dosing , patients must have an ANC of 1 . 5 x 10 9 / L or greater and a platelet count of 100 x 10 9 / L or greater .
For the concomitant phase with radiotherapy , obtain a complete blood count prior to initiation of treatment and weekly during treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
For the 28 - day treatment cycles , obtain a complete blood count prior to treatment on Day 1 and on Day 22 of each cycle .
Perform complete blood counts weekly until recovery if the ANC falls below 1 . 5 x 10 9 / L and the platelet count falls below 100 x 10 9 / L [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Secondary Malignancies Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies , including myeloid leukemia , have been observed following Temozolomide administration .
5 . 3 Pneumocystis Pneumonia Pneumocystis pneumonia ( PCP ) can occur in patients receiving Temozolomide .

For patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma , provide PCP prophylaxis for all patients during the concomitant phase .
Continue in patients who experience lymphopenia until resolution to grade 1 or less [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor all patients receiving Temozolomide for the development of lymphopenia and PCP .
5 . 4 Hepatotoxicity Fatal and severe hepatotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving Temozolomide .
Perform liver tests at baseline , midway through the first cycle , prior to each subsequent cycle , and approximately two to four weeks after the last dose of Temozolomide .
5 . 5 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action , Temozolomide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Adverse developmental outcomes have been reported in both pregnant patients and pregnant partners of male patients .
Oral administration of Temozolomide to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryolethality and polymalformations at doses less than the maximum human dose based on body surface area .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Temozolomide and for at least 6 months after the final dose .
Because of potential risk of genotoxic effects on sperm , advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with Temozolomide and for at least 3 months after the final dose .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma The safety of Temozolomide was evaluated in Study MK - 7365 - 051 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Forty - nine percent ( 49 % ) of patients treated with Temozolomide reported one or more severe or life - threatening reactions , most commonly fatigue ( 13 % ) , convulsions ( 6 % ) , headache ( 5 % ) , and thrombocytopenia ( 5 % ) .
The most common adverse reactions ( greater than or equal to 20 % ) across the cumulative Temozolomide experience were alopecia , fatigue , nausea , and vomiting .
Table 3 summarizes the adverse reactions in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Trial .
Overall , the pattern of reactions during the maintenance phase was consistent with the known safety profile of Temozolomide .

NOS = not otherwise specified .
Note : Grade 5 ( fatal ) adverse reactions are included in the Grade greater than or equal to 3 column .
When laboratory abnormalities and adverse reactions were combined , Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic reactions were observed in 8 % of the patients , and Grade 3 or Grade 4 platelet abnormalities including thrombocytopenic reactions , were observed in 14 % of the patients .
Refractory Anaplastic Astrocytoma The safety of Temozolomide was evaluated in Study MK - 7365 - 006 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Myelosuppression ( thrombocytopenia and neutropenia ) was the dose - limiting adverse reaction .
It usually occurred within the first few cycles of therapy and was not cumulative .
Myelosuppression occurred late in the treatment cycle and returned to normal , on average , within 14 days of nadir counts .
The median nadirs occurred at 26 days for platelets ( range : 21 - 40 days ) and 28 days for neutrophils ( range : 1 - 44 days ) .
Only 14 % ( 22 / 158 ) of patients had a neutrophil nadir and 20 % ( 32 / 158 ) of patients had a platelet nadir , which may have delayed the start of the next cycle .
Less than 10 % of patients required hospitalization , blood transfusion , or discontinuation of therapy due to myelosuppression .
The most common adverse reactions ( greater than or equal to 20 % ) were nausea , vomiting , headache , fatigue , constipation , and convulsions .

In the entire safety database for which hematologic data exist ( N = 932 ) , 7 % ( 4 / 61 ) and 9 . 5 % ( 6 / 63 ) of patients over age 70 experienced Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the first cycle , respectively .
For patients less than or equal to age 70 , 7 % ( 62 / 871 ) and 5 . 5 % ( 48 / 879 ) experienced Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the first cycle , respectively .
Pancytopenia , leukopenia , and anemia also occurred .
Adverse reactions with Temozolomide for injection Adverse reactions that were reported in 35 patients who received Temozolomide for injection that were not reported in patients who received Temozolomide capsules USP were pain , irritation , pruritus , warmth , swelling , and erythema at infusion site ; petechiae and hematoma .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of Temozolomide .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the drug exposure .
Dermatologic : Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens - Johnson syndrome Immune System : Hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis .
Erythema multiforme , which resolved after discontinuation of Temozolomide and , in some cases , recurred upon rechallenge .
Hematopoietic : Prolonged pancytopenia , which may result in aplastic anemia and fatal outcomes .
Hepatobiliary : Fatal and severe hepatotoxicity , elevation of liver enzymes , hyperbilirubinemia , cholestasis , and hepatitis .
Infections : Serious opportunistic infections , including some cases with fatal outcomes , can occur with bacterial , viral ( primary and reactivated ) , fungal , and protozoan organisms .
Pulmonary : Interstitial pneumonitis , pneumonitis , alveolitis , and pulmonary fibrosis .
Endocrine : Diabetes insipidus 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA - approved patient labeling .
Revised : 02 / 2021 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] and findings from animal studies , Temozolomide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Available postmarketing reports describe cases of spontaneous abortions and congenital malformations , including polymalformations with central nervous system , facial , cardiac , skeletal , and genitourinary system anomalies with exposure to Temozolomide during pregnancy .
These cases report similar adverse developmental outcomes to those observed in animal studies .
Administration of Temozolomide to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused numerous external , internal , and skeletal malformations at doses less than the maximum human dose based on body surface area ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Five consecutive days of oral administration of Temozolomide at doses of 75 and 150 mg / m 2 ( 0 . 38 and 0 . 75 times the human dose of 200 mg / m 2 ) in rats and rabbits , respectively , during the period of organogenesis ( Gestation Days 8 - 12 ) caused numerous malformations of the external and internal organs and skeleton in both species .
In rabbits , Temozolomide at the 150 mg / m 2 dose ( 0 . 75 times the human dose of 200 mg / m 2 ) caused embryolethality as indicated by increased resorptions .
8 . 2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of Temozolomide or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on a breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions , including myelosuppression from Temozolomide in the breastfed children , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Temozolomide and for at least 1 week after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Temozolomide [ see Use in Specific Population ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Females Temozolomide can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Population ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Temozolomide and for at least 6 months after the last dose .
Males Because of the potential for embryofetal toxicity and genotoxic effects on sperm cells , advise male patients with pregnant partners or female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with Temozolomide and for at least 3 months after the final dose [ see Use in Specific Population ( 8 . 1 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Advise male patients not to donate semen during treatment with Temozolomide and or at least 3 months after the final dose .
Infertility Temozolomide may impair male fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Limited data from male patients show changes in sperm parameters during treatment with Temozolomide ; however , no information is available on the duration or reversibility of these changes .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Temozolomide have not been established in pediatric patients .
Safety and effectiveness of Temozolomide capsules USP were assessed , but not established , in 2 open - label studies in pediatric patients aged 3 to 18 years .
In one study , 29 patients with recurrent brain stem glioma and 34 patients with recurrent high - grade astrocytoma were enrolled .
In a second study conducted by the Children ’ s Oncology Group ( COG ) , 122 patients were enrolled , including patients with medulloblastoma / PNET ( 29 ) , high grade astrocytoma ( 23 ) , low grade astrocytoma ( 22 ) , brain stem glioma ( 16 ) , ependymoma ( 14 ) , other CNS tumors ( 9 ) , and non - CNS tumors ( 9 ) .
The adverse reaction profile in pediatric patients was similar to adults .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In the Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma trial , Study MK - 7365 - 051 , 15 % of patients were 65 years and older .
This study did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine differences in effectiveness from younger patients .
No overall differences in safety were observed between patients greater than or equal to 65 years and younger patients .
In the Refractory Anaplastic Astrocytoma trial , MK - 7365 - 0006 , 4 % of patients were 70 years and older .
This study did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 70 years and older to determine differences in effectiveness from younger patients .
Patients 70 years and older had a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia ( 25 % ) and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia ( 20 % ) in the first cycle of therapy than patients less than 70 years of age [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) of 36 to 130 mL / min / m 2 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The recommended dose of Temozolomide has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr less than 36 mL / min / m 2 ) or for patients with end - stage disease on dialysis .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh class A and B ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The recommended dose of Temozolomide has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh class C ) .
10 OVERDOSAGE Dose - limiting toxicity was myelosuppression and was reported with any dose but is expected to be more severe at higher doses .
An overdose of 2000 mg per day for 5 days was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia , pyrexia , multi - organ failure , and death .
There are reports of patients who have taken more than 5 days of treatment ( up to 64 days ) , with adverse reactions reported including myelosuppression , which in some cases was severe and prolonged , and infections and resulted in death .
In the event of an overdose , monitor complete blood count and provide supportive measures as necessary .
11 DESCRIPTION Temozolomide is an alkylating drug .
The chemical name of temozolomide is 3 , 4 - dihydro - 3 methyl - 4 - oxoimidazo [ 5 , 1 - d ] - as - tetrazine - 8 - carboxamide .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The material is a white to light tan / light pink powder with a molecular formula of C 6 H6 N6 O 2 and a molecular weight of 194 . 15 .
The molecule is stable at acidic pH ( less than 5 ) and labile at pH greater than 7 ; hence Temozolomide can be administered orally .
The prodrug , temozolomide , is rapidly hydrolyzed to the active 5 - ( 3 - methyltriazen - 1 - yl ) imidazole - 4 - carboxamide ( MTIC ) at neutral and alkaline pH values , with hydrolysis taking place even faster at alkaline pH .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Temozolomide is not directly active but undergoes rapid nonenzymatic conversion at physiologic pH to the reactive compound 5 - ( 3 - methyltriazen - 1 - yl ) - imidazole - 4 - carboxamide ( MTIC ) .
The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA .
Alkylation ( methylation ) occurs mainly at the O 6 and N 7 positions of guanine .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following a single oral dose of 150 mg / m 2 , the mean C max value for Temozolomide was 7 . 5 mcg / mL and for MTIC was 282 ng / mL .
The mean AUC value for Temozolomide was 23 . 4 mcg • hr / mL and for MTIC was 864 ng • hr / mL .
Following a single 90 - minute intravenous infusion of 150 mg / m 2 , the mean C max value for Temozolomide was 7 . 3 mcg / mL and for MTIC was 276 ng / mL .
The mean AUC value for Temozolomide was 24 . 6 mcg • hr / mL and for MTIC was 891 ng • hr / mL .
Temozolomide exhibits linear kinetics over the therapeutic dosing range of 75 mg / m 2 / day to 250 mg / m 2 / day .
Absorption The median T max is 1 hour .
Effect of Food The mean C max and AUC decreased by 32 % and 9 % , respectively , and median T max increased by 2 - fold ( from 1 - 2 . 25 hours ) when Temozolomide capsules were administered after a modified high - fat breakfast ( 587 calories of 1 fried egg , 2 strips of bacon , 2 slices of toast , 2 pats of butter , and 8 oz whole milk ) .
Distribution Temozolomide has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 0 . 4 L / kg ( % CV = 13 % ) .
The mean percent bound of drug - related total radioactivity is 15 % .
Elimination Clearance of temozolomide is about 5 . 5 L / hr / m 2 and the mean elimination half - life is 1 . 8 hours .
Metabolism Temozolomide is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH to the active species , MTIC and to temozolomide acid metabolite .
MTIC is further hydrolyzed to 5 - amino - imidazole - 4 - carboxamide ( AIC ) , which is known to be an intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis , and to methylhydrazine , which is believed to be the active alkylating species .
Cytochrome P450 enzymes play only a minor role in the metabolism of temozolomide and MTIC .
Relative to the AUC of temozolomide , the exposure to MTIC and AIC is 2 . 4 % and 23 % , respectively .
Excretion About 38 % of the administered temozolomide total radioactive dose is recovered over 7 days : 38 % in urine and 0 . 8 % in feces .
The majority of the recovery of radioactivity in urine is unchanged temozolomide ( 6 % ) , AIC ( 12 % ) , temozolomide acid metabolite ( 2 . 3 % ) , and unidentified polar metabolite ( s ) ( 17 % ) .
Specific Populations No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide were observed based on age ( range : 19 - 78 years ) , gender , smoking status ( smoker vs . non - smoker ) , creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) of 36 to 130 mL / min / m 2 , or mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh class A and B ) .
The pharmacokinetics of temozolomide has not been studies in patients with CLcr < 36 mL / min / m 2 , end - stage renal disease on dialysis , or severe hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh class C ) .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on Temozolomide Pharmacokinetics In a multiple - dose study , administration of Temozolomide capsules USP with ranitidine did not change the C max or AUC values for temozolomide or MTIC .
A population analysis indicated that administration of valproic acid decreases the clearance of temozolomide by about 5 % .
A population analysis did not demonstrate any influence of coadministered dexamethasone , prochlorperazine , phenytoin , carbamazepine , ondansetron , histamine - 2 - receptor antagonists , or phenobarbital on the clearance of orally administered temozolomide .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Temozolomide is carcinogenic in rats at doses less than the maximum recommended human dose .
Temozolomide induced mammary carcinomas in both males and females at doses 0 . 13 to 0 . 63 times the maximum human dose ( 25 - 125 mg / m 2 ) when administered orally on 5 consecutive days every 28 days for 6 cycles .
Temozolomide also induced fibrosarcomas of the heart , eye , seminal vesicles , salivary glands , abdominal cavity , uterus , and prostate , carcinomas of the seminal vesicles , schwannomas of the heart , optic nerve , and harderian gland , and adenomas of the skin , lung , pituitary , and thyroid at doses 0 . 5 times the maximum daily dose .
Mammary tumors were also induced following 3 cycles of temozolomide at the maximum recommended daily dose .
Temozolomide is a mutagen and a clastogen .
In a reverse bacterial mutagenesis assay ( Ames assay ) , temozolomide increased revertant frequency in the absence and presence of metabolic activation .
Temozolomide was clastogenic in human lymphocytes in the presence and absence of metabolic activation .
Temozolomide impairs male fertility .
Temozolomide caused syncytial cells / immature sperm formation at doses of 50 and 125 mg / m 2 ( 0 . 25 and 0 . 63 times the human dose of 200 mg / m 2 ) in rats and dogs , respectively , and testicular atrophy in dogs at 125 mg / m 2 .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Toxicology studies in rats and dogs identified a low incidence of hemorrhage , degeneration , and necrosis of the retina at temozolomide doses equal to or greater than 125 mg / m 2 ( 0 . 63 times the human dose of 200 mg / m 2 ) .
These changes were most commonly seen at doses where mortality was observed .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma The efficacy of Temozolomide was evaluated in Study MK - 7365 - 051 , a randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , multicenter , open - label trial .
Eligible patients were required to have newly diagnosed glioblastoma .
Patients were randomized to receive either radiation therapy alone or concomitant Temozolomide 75 mg / m 2 once daily starting the first day of radiation therapy and continuing the last day of radiation therapy for 42 days ( with maximum of 49 days ) , followed by Temozolomide 150 mg / m 2 or 200 mg / m 2 once daily on Days 1 to 5 of each 28 - day cycle , starting 4 weeks after the end of radiation therapy and continuing for 6 cycles .
In both arms , focal radiation therapy was delivered as 60 Gy / 30 fractions and included radiation to the tumor bed or resection site with a 2 to 3 - cm margin .
PCP prophylaxis was required during the concomitant phase , regardless of lymphocyte count and continued until recovery of lymphocyte count to grade 1 or less .
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival .
A total of 573 patients were randomized , 287 to Temozolomide and radiation therapy and 286 to radiation therapy alone .
At the time of disease progression , Temozolomide was administered as salvage therapy in 161 patients of the 282 ( 57 % ) in the radiation therapy alone arm , and 62 patients of the 277 ( 22 % ) in the Temozolomide and radiation therapy arm .
The addition of concomitant and maintenance Temozolomide to radiation therapy in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared to radiotherapy alone ( Figure 1 ) .
The hazard ratio ( HR ) for overall survival was 0 . 63 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 52 , 0 . 75 ) with a log - rank P less than 0 . 0001 in favor of the Temozolomide arm .
The median survival was increased by 2 . 5 months in the Temozolomide arm .
FIGURE 1 : Kaplan - Meier Curves for Overall Survival ( ITT Population ) in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Trial [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Refractory Anaplastic Astrocytoma The efficacy of Temozolomide was evaluated in Study MK - 7365 - 006 , a single - arm , multicenter trial .
Eligible patients had anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse and a baseline Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) of 70 or greater .
Patients had previously received radiation therapy and may also have previously received a nitrosourea with or without other chemotherapy .
Fifty - four patients had disease progression on prior therapy with both a nitrosourea and procarbazine , and their malignancy was considered refractory to chemotherapy ( refractory anaplastic astrocytoma population ) .
Temozolomide capsules USP were given on Days 1 to 5 of each 28 - day cycle at a starting dose of 150 mg / m 2 / day .
If ANC was greater than or equal to 1 . 5 x 10 9 / L and platelet count was greater than or equal to 100 x 10 9 / L at the nadir and on Day 1 of the next cycle , the Temozolomide dose was increased to 200 mg / m 2 / day .
The major efficacy outcome measure was progression - free survival at 6 months and the additional efficacy outcome measures were overall survival and overall response rate .
In the refractory anaplastic astrocytoma population ( n = 54 ) , the median age was 42 years ( range : 19 to 76 ) ; 65 % were male ; and 72 % had a KPS of greater than 80 .
Sixty - three percent of patients had surgery other than a biopsy at the time of initial diagnosis .
Of those patients undergoing resection , 73 % underwent a subtotal resection and 27 % underwent a gross total resection .
Eighteen percent of patients had surgery at the time of first relapse .
The median time from initial diagnosis to first relapse was 13 . 8 months ( range : 4 . 2 months to 6 . 3 years ) .
In the refractory anaplastic astrocytoma population , the overall response rate ( CR + PR ) was 22 % ( 12 of 54 patients ) and the complete response rate was 9 % ( 5 of 54 patients ) .
The median duration of all responses was 50 weeks ( range : 16 to 114 weeks ) and the median duration of complete responses was 64 weeks ( range : 52 to 114 weeks ) .
In this population , progression - free survival at 6 months was 45 % ( 95 % CI : 31 % , 58 % ) and progression - free survival at 12 months was 29 % ( 95 % CI : 16 % , 42 % ) .
Median progression - free survival was 4 . 4 months .
Overall survival at 6 months was 74 % ( 95 % CI : 62 % , 86 % ) and 12 - month overall survival was 65 % ( 95 % CI : 52 % , 78 % ) .
Median overall survival was 15 . 9 months .
