Do not use in children under 6 years of age unless recommended by a dentist or physician .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • DO NOT SWALLOW .
If more than a pea - sized amount of Clinpro 5000 Anti - Cavity Toothpaste is swallowed , contact a medical or dental professional or a poison control center .
• Keep out of reach of children under 6 years of age .
• Repeated ingestion of high levels of fluoride may cause dental fluorosis .
For this reason , use in children with developing dentition requires special supervision to prevent swallowing .
Prescribing dentists and physicians should consider risk of fluorosis when prescribing for use in children less than 6 years of age .
• Do not swallow .

( 5 ) 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Allergic reactions and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported .
Allergic reactions and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported .
( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact 3 M ESPE Dental Products Division at 1 - 800 - 634 - 2249 or www . 3 MESPE . com , or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Fluoride crosses the placenta in women and has been measured in cord blood , amniotic fluid , and serum of newborn children , but without a consistent correlation to maternal serum fluoride levels . 1 , 2 There are no data to indicate an increased susceptibility to fluorosis during pregnancy .
Developmental studies were conducted by the National Toxicology Program , with sodium fluoride administered in the drinking water to pregnant rats and rabbits .
No developmental toxicity was observed , even at doses that caused maternal toxicity .
The No Adverse Effect Levels were about 29 mg / kg - day and 27 mg / kg - day for rabbits and rats , respectively . 3 There is no conclusive evidence of fluoride developmental effects in humans . 1 , 2 The Institute of Medicine established a fluoride Upper Limit of 10 mg / day for pregnant women . 2 Prescribing physicians and dentists should consider total fluoride exposure ( dental care plus food , water and other sources ) when prescribing the product for use in pregnant women or women who may become pregnant .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers An extremely small proportion of fluoride in drinking water is transferred to breast milk .
The Institute of Medicine established a fluoride Upper Limit of 10 mg / day for nursing women . 2 Prescribing physicians and dentists should consider total fluoride exposure ( dental care plus food , water and other sources ) when prescribing the product for use in women who are nursing .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The primary adverse effects of fluoride are fluorosis of dental enamel and of the skeleton ; these effects occur at exposures below those associated with other adverse health effects .
The population most at risk for dental fluorosis is children during the period of tooth formation , i . e . from birth to 8 years of age .
For this population , the Institute of Medicine established Fluoride Upper Limits of intake based on the risk of dental fluorosis .
In populations with permanent dentition , skeletal fluorosis is the greatest risk from excessive fluoride .
For this population the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) established Fluoride Upper Limits based on the risk of skeletal fluorosis . 2 Population IOM Fluoride Upper Limit Infants 0 - 6 months old 0 . 7 mg / day Infants 7 - 12 months old 0 . 9 mg / day Children 1 - 3 years old 1 . 3 mg / day Children 4 - 8 years old 2 . 2 mg / day Children > 8 years old 10 mg / day Prescribing physicians and dentists should consider total fluoride exposure ( dental care plus food , water and other sources ) when prescribing the product for use in children .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No studies of Clinpro 5000 Anti - Cavity Toothpaste have been conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects .
10 OVERDOSAGE Ingestion of large amounts of fluoride may result in abdominal pain , stomach upset , nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea .
These symptoms may occur at overdosages of 5 mg / kg of body weight .
Fluoride doses of 16 mg / kg have been fatal .
Treatment Recommendations for Overdose of Clinpro 5000 Anti - Cavity Toothpaste4 Ingested fluoride dose Amount for 10 kg ( 22 pound ) child * Recommended action to take Less than 5 mg / kg This equals less than ½ ounce ( or less than 3 teaspoons ) .
Do not induce vomiting .
Give 1 - 2 glasses of milk and observe for symptoms of stomach upset .
If symptoms persist more than a few hours , seek medical attention or contact a poison control center .
5 mg / kg or more This equals about ½ ounce ( about 1 tablespoon ) or more .
Do not induce vomiting .
Give 1 - 2 glasses of milk and seek medical attention or contact a poison control center .
15 mg / kg This equals 1 ounce or ¼ of the tube .
Seek immediate medical attention .
Do not induce vomiting .
Give 1 - 2 glasses of milk .
* The amount to reach the fluoride dose will be proportionately larger with older children and adults .
A thin ribbon or pea - sized amount of Clinpro 5000 Anti - Cavity Toothpaste weighs approximately 0 . 3 g and contains approximately 1 . 5 mg of fluoride ion .
A 4 oz .
tube contains 564 mg of fluoride ion .
11 DESCRIPTION Clinpro 5000 1 . 1 % Sodium Fluoride Anti - Cavity Toothpaste is a self - applied fluoride dentifrice for the prevention of dental caries .
Each gram contains 5 mg of fluoride ion in a neutral pH base , consisting of water , sorbitol , hydrated silica , glycerin , polyethylene - polypropylene glycol , flavor , polyethylene glycol , sodium lauryl sulfate , titanium dioxide , carboxymethyl cellulose , sodium saccharin and tri - calcium phosphate .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Clinpro 5000 1 . 1 % Sodium Fluoride Anti - Cavity Toothpaste aids in the prevention of tooth decay .
Fluoride delivered from Clinpro 5000 inhibits the demineralization of sound teeth and enhances the remineralization ( i . e . , repair ) of demineralized teeth .
During tooth brushing , fluoride is taken up by teeth and dental plaque .
Fluoride is taken up with calcium and phosphate by demineralized teeth resulting in an improved tooth structure than contains more fluoride and less carbonate than naturally occurring tooth structure and is more resistant to acid challenge .
Additionally , calcium fluoride is formed on the crystal structure of teeth .
As the pH of the mouth drops , fluoride is released from calcium fluoride and aids in the remineralization of teeth .
Fluoride taken up into plaque alters the activity of cariogenic bacteria .
Fluoride inhibits the process by which cariogenic bacteria metabolize carbohydrates resulting in less acid and adhesive polysaccharide production by the bacteria .
