6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of the drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of ≥ 5 % in an uncontrolled trial in 66 patients with cystinuria age 9 to 68 years are shown in the table below .
Patients in group 1 had previously been treated with d - penicillamine ; those in group 2 had not .
Of those patients who had stopped taking d - penicillamine due to toxicity ( 34 out of 49 patients in group 1 ) , 22 were able to continue treatment with THIOLA .
In those without prior history of d - penicillamine treatment , 6 % developed reactions of sufficient severity to require THIOLA withdrawal .
Table 1 presents adverse reactions ≥ 5 % in either treatment group occurring in this trial .

It is believed to be the result of chelation of trace metals by tiopronin .
Hypogeusia is often self - limited .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been reported from the literature , as well as during post - approval use of THIOLA .
Because the post - approval reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to THIOLA exposure .
Adverse reactions reported during the postmarketing use of THIOLA are listed by body system in Table 2 .

( 8 . 2 ) • Geriatric : Choose dose carefully and monitor renal function in the elderly .
( 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available published case report data with tiopronin have not identified a drug - associated risk for major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Renal stones in pregnancy may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
In animal reproduction studies , there were no adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tiopronin to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses up to 2 times a 2 grams / day human dose ( based on mg / m2 ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Renal stones in pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes , such as preterm birth and low birth weight .
Data Animal Data No findings of fetal malformations could be attributed to the drug in reproduction studies in mice and rats at doses up to 2 times the highest recommended human dose of 2 grams / day ( based on mg / m2 ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tiopronin in either human or animal milk or on the effects of the breastfed child .
A published study suggests that tiopronin may suppress milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions , including nephrotic syndrome , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with THIOLA .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use THIOLA is indicated in pediatric patients weighing 20 kg or more with severe homozygous cystinuria , in combination with high fluid intake , alkali , and diet modification , for the prevention of cystine stone formation who are not responsive to these measures alone .
This indication is based on safety and efficacy data from a trial in patients 9 years to 68 years of age and clinical experience .
Proteinuria , including nephrotic syndrome , has been reported in pediatric patients .
Pediatric patients receiving greater than 50 mg / kg tiopronin per day may be at greater risk [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
THIOLA tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg or in pediatric patients unable to swallow tablets [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no information on overdosage with tiopronin .
11 DESCRIPTION THIOLA ( tiopronin ) immediate - release tablets are a reducing and cystine - binding thiol drug ( CBTD ) for oral use .
Tiopronin is N - ( 2 - Mercaptopropionyl ) glycine and has the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Tiopronin has the empirical formula C5H9NO3S and a molecular weight of 163 . 20 .
In this drug product tiopronin exists as a dl racemic mixture .
Tiopronin is a white crystalline powder , which is freely soluble in water .
Each Thiola tablet contains 100 mg of tiopronin .
The inactive ingredients in THIOLA tablets include calcium carbonate , carnauba wax , ethyl cellulose , dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate : butyl methacrylate : methyl methacrylate copolymer ( Eudragit E 100 ) , hydroxy - propyl cellulose , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate , povidone , sugar , talc , titanium dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The goal of therapy is to reduce urinary cystine concentration below its solubility limit .
Tiopronin is an active reducing agent which undergoes thiol - disulfide exchange with cystine to form a mixed disulfide of tiopronin - cysteine .
From this reaction , a water - soluble mixed disulfide is formed and the amount of sparingly soluble cystine is reduced .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The decrement in urinary cystine produced by tiopronin is generally proportional to the dose .
A reduction in urinary cystine of 250 - 350 mg / day at tiopronin dosage of 1 g / day , and a decline of approximately 500 mg / day at a dosage of 2 g / day , might be expected .
Tiopronin has a rapid onset and offset of action , showing a fall in cystine excretion on the first day of administration and a rise on the first day of drug withdrawal .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption THIOLA Tablets When THIOLA single doses were given to fasted healthy subjects ( n = 39 ) , the median time to peak plasma level ( Tmax ) was 1 ( range : 0 . 5 to 2 . 1 ) hours .
Elimination Excretion When tiopronin is given orally , up to 48 % of dose appears in urine during the first 4 hours and up to 78 % by 72 hours .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term carcinogenicity studies in animals have not been performed .
Mutagenesis Tiopronin was not genotoxic in the chromosomal aberration , sister chromatid exchange , and in vivo micronucleus assays .
Impairment of Fertility High doses of tiopronin in experimental animals have been shown to interfere with maintenance of pregnancy and viability of the fetus .
In 2 published male fertility studies in rats , tiopronin at 20 mg / kg / day intramuscular ( IM ) for 60 days induced reductions in testis , epididymis , vas deferens , and accessory sex glands weights and in the count and motility of cauda epididymal sperm .
