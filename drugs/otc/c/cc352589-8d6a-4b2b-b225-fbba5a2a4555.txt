DESCRIPTION Diclofenac Sodium Gel , 3 % , contains the active ingredient , diclofenac sodium , in a clear , transparent , colorless to slightly yellow gel base .
Diclofenac sodium is a white to slightly yellow crystalline powder .
It is freely soluble in methanol , soluble in ethanol , sparingly soluble in water , slightly soluble in acetone , and partially insoluble in ether .
The chemical name for diclofenac sodium is : Sodium [ o - ( 2 , 6 - dichloranilino ) phenyl ] acetate Diclofenac sodium has a molecular weight of 318 . 13 .
The CAS number is CAS - 15307 - 79 - 6 .
The structural formula is represented below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Diclofenac Sodium Gel , 3 % also contains benzyl alcohol , hyaluronate sodium , polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether , and purified water .
1 g of Diclofenac Sodium Gel contains 30 mg of the active substance , diclofenac sodium .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium in the treatment of actinic keratoses ( AK ) is unknown .
The contribution to efficacy of individual components of the vehicle has not been established .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption When diclofenac sodium gel is applied topically , diclofenac is absorbed into the epidermis .
In a study in patients with compromised skin ( mainly atopic dermatitis and other dermatitic conditions ) of the hands , arms or face , approximately 10 % of the applied dose ( 2 grams of 3 % gel over 100 cm2 ) of diclofenac was absorbed systemically in both normal and compromised epidermis after seven days , with four times daily applications .
After topical application of 2 g diclofenac sodium gel three times daily for six days to the calf of the leg in healthy subjects , diclofenac could be detected in plasma .
Mean bioavailability parameters were AUC0 - t 9 ± 19 ng / hr / mL ( mean ± SD ) with a Cmax of 4 ± 5 ng / mL and a Tmax of 4 . 5 ± 8 hours .
In comparison , a single oral 75 mg dose of diclofenac ( Voltaren ® ) [ 1 ] produced an AUC of 1600 ng / hr / mL .
Therefore , the systemic bioavailability after topical application of diclofenac sodium gel is lower than after oral dosing .
Comparative bioavailability studies have not been conducted between available diclofenac topical products ( gels containing 1 to 3 % diclofenac ) which have different dosing regimens .
A cross - study evaluation of the data indicates that diclofenac is more bioavailable when applied to diseased skin and less bioavailable when applied to intact skin .
Blood drawn at the end of treatment from 60 patients with AK lesions treated with diclofenac sodium gel in three adequate and well - controlled clinical trials was assayed for diclofenac levels .
Each patient was administered 0 . 5 g of diclofenac sodium gel twice a day for up to 105 days .
There were up to three 5 cm × 5 cm treatment sites per patient on the face , forehead , hands , forearm , and scalp .
Serum concentrations of diclofenac were , on average , at or below 20 ng / mL .
These data indicate that systemic absorption of diclofenac in patients treated topically with diclofenac sodium gel is much lower than that occurring after oral daily dosing of diclofenac sodium .
No information is available on the absorption of diclofenac when diclofenac sodium gel is used under occlusion .
Distribution Diclofenac binds tightly to serum albumin .
The volume of distribution of diclofenac following oral administration is approximately 550 mL / kg .
Metabolism Biotransformation of diclofenac following oral administration involves conjugation at the carboxyl group of the side chain or single or multiple hydroxylations resulting in several phenolic metabolites , most of which are converted to glucuronide conjugates .
Two of these phenolic metabolites are biologically active , however to a much smaller extent than diclofenac .
Metabolism of diclofenac following topical administration is thought to be similar to that after oral administration .
The small amounts of diclofenac and its metabolites appearing in the plasma following topical administration makes the quantification of specific metabolites imprecise .
Elimination Diclofenac and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine after oral dosing .
Systemic clearance of diclofenac from plasma is 263 ± 56 mL / min ( mean ± SD ) .
The terminal plasma half - life is 1 to 2 hours .
Four of the metabolites also have short terminal half - lives of 1 to 3 hours .

INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diclofenac Sodium Gel is indicated for the topical treatment of actinic keratoses ( AK ) .
Sun avoidance is indicated during therapy .
CLINICAL STUDIES Clinical trials were conducted involving a total of 427 patients ( 213 treated with diclofenac sodium gel and 214 with a gel vehicle ) .
Each patient had no fewer than five AK lesions in a major body area , which was defined as one of five 5 cm × 5 cm regions : scalp , forehead , face , forearm and hand .
Up to three major body areas were studied in any patient .
All patients were 18 years of age or older ( male and female ) with no clinically significant medical problems outside of the AK lesions and had undergone a 60 - day washout period from disallowed medications ( masoprocol , 5 - fluorouracil , cyclosporine , retinoids , trichloroacetic acid / lactic acid / peel , 50 % glycolic acid peel ) and hyaluronan - containing cosmetics .
Patients were excluded from participation for reasons of known or suspected hypersensitivity to any diclofenac sodium gel ingredient , pregnancy , allergies to aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , or other dermatological conditions which might affect the absorption of the study medication .
Application of dermatologic products such as sunscreens , cosmetics , and other drug products was not permitted .
Patients were instructed to apply a small amount of diclofenac sodium gel ( approximately 0 . 5 g ) onto the affected skin , using their fingers , and gently smoothing the gel over the lesion .
In addition , all patients were instructed to avoid sun exposure .
Complete clearing of the AK lesions 30 days after completion of treatment was the primary efficacy variable .
No long - term patient follow - ups , after the 30 - day assessments , were performed for the detection of recurrence .

WARNINGS As with other NSAIDs , anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without prior exposure to diclofenac .
Diclofenac sodium should be given with caution to patients with the aspirin triad .
The triad typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps , or who exhibit severe , potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs .
PRECAUTIONS General Diclofenac Sodium Gel should be used with caution in patients with active gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding and severe renal or hepatic impairments .
Diclofenac sodium gel should not be applied to open skin wounds , infections , or exfoliative dermatitis .
It should not be allowed to come in contact with the eyes .
The safety of the concomitant use of sunscreens , cosmetics or other topical medications and diclofenac sodium gel is unknown .
Information for Patients In clinical studies , localized dermal side effects such as contact dermatitis , exfoliation , dry skin and rash were found in patients treated with diclofenac sodium gel at a higher incidence than in those with placebo .
Patients should understand the importance of monitoring and follow - up evaluation , the signs and symptoms of dermal adverse reactions , and the possibility of irritant or allergic contact dermatitis .
If severe dermal reactions occur , treatment with diclofenac sodium gel may be interrupted until the condition subsides .
Exposure to sunlight and the use of sunlamps should be avoided .
Safety and efficacy of the use of diclofenac sodium gel together with other dermal products , including cosmetics , sunscreens , and other topical medications on the area being treated , have not been studied .
Drug Interactions Specific interaction studies between diclofenac sodium gel and other topical or oral agents were not performed .
Oral Nonsteroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs Although low , there is systemic exposure to diclofenac following labeled use of diclofenac sodium gel .
Therefore , concomitant administration of diclofenac sodium gel with oral NSAIDs or aspirin may result in increased NSAID adverse effects .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility There did not appear to be any increase in drug - related neoplasms following daily topical applications of diclofenac sodium gel for 2 years at concentrations up to 0 . 035 % diclofenac sodium and 2 . 5 % hyaluronate sodium in albino mice .
( Note : diclofenac sodium gel contains 3 % diclofenac sodium . )
When administered orally for 2 years , diclofenac showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential in rats given diclofenac sodium at up to 2 mg / kg / day ( 3 times the estimated systemic human exposure [ 1 ] ) , or in mice given diclofenac sodium at up to 0 . 3 mg / kg / day in males and 1 mg / kg / day in females ( 25 % and 83 % , respectively , of the estimated systemic human exposure ) .
A photococarcinogenicity study with up to 0 . 035 % diclofenac in the diclofenac sodium vehicle gel was conducted in hairless mice at topical doses up to 2 . 8 mg / kg / day .
Median tumor onset was earlier in the 0 . 035 % group ( diclofenac sodium gel contains 3 % diclofenac sodium ) .
Diclofenac was not genotoxic in in vitro point mutation assays in mammalian mouse lymphoma cells and Ames microbial test systems , or when tested in mammalian in vivo assays including dominant lethal and male germinal epithelial chromosomal studies in mice , and nucleus anomaly and chromosomal aberration studies in Chinese hamsters .
It was also negative in the transformation assay utilizing BALB / 3T3 mouse embryo cells .
Fertility studies have not been conducted with diclofenac sodium gel .
Diclofenac sodium showed no evidence of impairment of fertility after oral treatment with 4 mg / kg / day ( 7 times the estimated systemic human exposure ) in male or female rats .
[ 1 ] Based on body surface area and assuming 10 % bioavailability following topical application of 2 g diclofenac sodium gel per day ( 1 mg / kg diclofenac sodium ) .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B The safety of diclofenac sodium gel has not been established during pregnancy .
However , reproductive studies performed with diclofenac sodium alone at oral doses up to 20 mg / kg / day ( 15 times the estimated systemic human exposure [ 1 ] ) in mice , 10 mg / kg / day ( 15 times the estimated systemic human exposure ) in rats , and 10 mg / kg / day ( 30 times the estimated systemic human exposure ) in rabbits have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity despite the induction of maternal toxicity .
In rats , maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia , prolonged gestation , reduced fetal weights and growth , and reduced fetal survival .
Diclofenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in mice and rats .
There are , however , no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefits to the mother justify the potential risk to the fetus .
Because of the risk to the fetus resulting in premature closure of the ductus arteriosus , diclofenac should be avoided in late pregnancy .
[ 1 ] Based on body surface area and assuming 10 % bioavailability following topical application of 2 g diclofenac sodium gel per day ( 1 mg / kg diclofenac sodium ) .
Labor and Delivery The effects of diclofenac on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown .
Because of the known effects of prostaglandin - inhibiting drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system ( closure of the ductus arteriosus ) , use of diclofenac during late pregnancy should be avoided and , as with other nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , it is possible that diclofenac may inhibit uterine contractions and delay parturition .
Nursing Mothers Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from diclofenac sodium , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use Actinic keratoses is not a condition seen within the pediatric population .
Diclofenac sodium gel should not be used by children .
Geriatric Use Of the 211 subjects treated with diclofenac sodium gel in controlled clinical studies , 143 subjects were 65 and over .
Of those 143 subjects , 55 subjects were 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Of the 423 patients evaluable for safety in adequate and well - controlled trials , 211 were treated with diclofenac sodium gel drug product and 212 were treated with a vehicle gel .
Eighty - seven percent ( 87 % ) of the diclofenac sodium gel - treated patients ( 183 patients ) and 84 % of the vehicle - treated patients ( 178 patients ) experienced one or more adverse events ( AEs ) during the studies .
The majority of these reactions were mild to moderate in severity and resolved upon discontinuation of therapy .
Of the 211 patients treated with diclofenac sodium gel , 172 ( 82 % ) experienced AEs involving skin and the application site compared to 160 ( 75 % ) vehicle - treated patients .
Application site reactions ( ASRs ) were the most frequent AEs in both diclofenac sodium gel - and vehicle - treated groups .
Of note , four reactions , contact dermatitis , rash , dry skin and exfoliation ( scaling ) were significantly more prevalent in the diclofenac sodium gel group than in the vehicle - treated patients .
Eighteen percent of diclofenac sodium gel - treated patients and 4 % of vehicle - treated patients discontinued from the clinical trials due to adverse events ( whether considered related to treatment or not ) .
These discontinuations were mainly due to skin irritation or related cutaneous adverse reactions .
Table 1 below presents the AEs reported at an incidence of > 1 % for patients treated with either diclofenac sodium gel or vehicle ( 60 - and 90 - day treatment groups ) during the phase 3 studies .

[ 1 ] Incidence greater than 1 % marked with asterisk .
OVERDOSAGE Due to the low systemic absorption of topically - applied diclofenac sodium gel , overdosage is unlikely .
There have been no reports of ingestion of diclofenac sodium gel .
In the event of oral ingestion , resulting in significant systemic side effects , it is recommended that the stomach be emptied by vomiting or lavage .
Forced diuresis may theoretically be beneficial because the drug is excreted in the urine .
The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion in the elimination of diclofenac ( 99 % protein - bound ) remains unproven .
In addition to supportive measures , the use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac .
Supportive and symptomatic treatment should be given for complications such as renal failure , convulsions , gastrointestinal irritation and respiratory depression .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Diclofenac sodium gel is applied to lesion areas twice daily .
It is to be smoothed onto the affected skin gently .
The amount needed depends upon the size of the lesion site .
Assure that enough diclofenac sodium gel is applied to adequately cover each lesion .
Normally 0 . 5 g of gel is used on each 5 cm × 5 cm lesion site .
The recommended duration of therapy is from 60 days to 90 days .
Complete healing of the lesion ( s ) or optimal therapeutic effect may not be evident for up to 30 days following cessation of therapy .
Lesions that do not respond to therapy should be carefully re - evaluated and management reconsidered .
