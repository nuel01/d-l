( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Liver Enzyme Elevations : Monitor monthly and discontinue for persistent elevations .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Zinc Deficiency : Monitor during therapy and supplement for deficiency .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Agranulocytosis and Neutropenia Fatal agranulocytosis can occur with deferiprone tablets use .
Deferiprone tablets can also cause neutropenia , which may foreshadow agranulocytosis .
Measure the absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) before starting deferiprone tablets therapy and monitor it regularly while on therapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Reduction in the frequency of ANC monitoring should be considered on an individual patient basis , according to the health care provider ’ s assessment of the patient ’ s understanding of the risk minimization measures required during therapy .
Interrupt deferiprone tablets therapy if neutropenia develops ( ANC < 1 . 5 x 109 / L ) .
Interrupt deferiprone tablets if infection develops and monitor the ANC frequently .
Advise patients taking deferiprone tablets to immediately interrupt therapy and report to their physician if they experience any symptoms indicative of infection .
The incidence of agranulocytosis was 1 . 7 % of patients in pooled clinical trials of 642 patients with thalassemia syndromes .
The mechanism of deferiprone - associated agranulocytosis is unknown .
Agranulocytosis and neutropenia usually resolve upon discontinuation of deferiprone tablets , but there have been reports of agranulocytosis leading to death .
Implement a plan to monitor for and to manage agranulocytosis and neutropenia prior to initiating deferiprone tablets treatment .
For agranulocytosis ( ANC < 0 . 5 x 109 / L ) : Consider hospitalization and other management as clinically appropriate .
Do not resume deferiprone tablets in patients who have developed agranulocytosis unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks .
Do not rechallenge patients who have developed neutropenia with deferiprone tablets unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks .
For neutropenia ( ANC < 1 . 5 x 109 / L and > 0 . 5 x 109 / L ) : Instruct the patient to immediately discontinue deferiprone tablets and all other medications with a potential to cause neutropenia .
Obtain a complete blood cell ( CBC ) count , including a white blood cell ( WBC ) count corrected for the presence of nucleated red blood cells , an absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) , and a platelet count daily until recovery ( ANC ≥ 1 . 5 x 109 / L ) .
5 . 2 Liver Enzyme Elevations In pooled clinical trials , 7 . 5 % of 642 patients with thalassemia syndromes treated with deferiprone tablets developed increased ALT values .
Four ( 0 . 62 % ) deferiprone tablet - treated subjects discontinued the drug due to increased serum ALT levels and 1 ( 0 . 16 % ) due to an increase in both ALT and AST .
Monitor serum ALT values monthly during therapy with deferiprone tablets and consider interruption of therapy if there is a persistent increase in the serum transaminase levels [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Zinc Deficiency Decreased plasma zinc concentrations have been observed on deferiprone tablets therapy .
Monitor plasma zinc annually , and supplement in the event of a deficiency [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 4 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and evidence of genotoxicity , deferiprone tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
The available data on the use of deferiprone tablets in pregnant women are insufficient to inform risk .
In animal studies , administration of deferiprone during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo - fetal death and malformations at doses lower than equivalent human clinical doses .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with deferiprone tablets and for at least six months after the last dose .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with deferiprone tablets and for at least three months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .

Polyvalent Cations : Deferiprone has the potential to bind polyvalent cations ( e . g . , iron , aluminum , and zinc ) ; allow at least a 4 - hour interval between deferiprone tablets and other medications ( e . g . , antacids ) , or supplements containing these polyvalent cations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary : In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of deferiprone to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 33 % and 49 % , respectively , of the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) resulted in structural abnormalities , embryo - fetal mortality and alterations to growth ( see Data ) .
The limited available data from deferiprone use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
Based on evidence and developmental toxicity in animal studies , deferiprone tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data : Human Data : Post - marketing data available from 39 pregnancies of deferiprone - treated patients and 10 pregnancies of partners of deferiprone - treated patients are as follows : Of the 39 pregnancies in deferiprone - treated patients , 23 resulted in healthy newborns , 6 ended in spontaneous abortion , 9 had unknown outcomes , and 1 infant was born with anal atresia , nephroptosis , ventricular septal defect , hemivertebra and urethral fistula .
Of the 10 pregnancies in partners of deferiprone - treated patients , 5 resulted in healthy newborns , 1 resulted in a healthy newborn with slight hypospadias , 1 was electively terminated , 1 resulted in the intrauterine death of twins , and 2 had unknown outcomes .
Animal Data : During organogenesis , pregnant rats and rabbits received deferiprone at oral doses of 0 , 30 , 80 or 200 mg / kg / day , and 0 , 10 , 50 , or 150 mg / kg / day , respectively .
The daily dose was administered as two equal divided doses approximately 7 hours apart .
Doses of 200 mg / kg / day in rats and 150 mg / kg / day in rabbits , approximately 33 % and 49 % of the MRHD , respectively , resulted in increased post - implantation loss and reduced fetal weights in the presence of maternal toxicity ( reduced maternal body weight and body weight gain in both rats and rabbits ; abnormal large placenta at low incidence in rats ) .
The 200 mg / kg / day dose in rats resulted in external , visceral and skeletal fetal malformations , such as cranial malformations , cleft palate , limb malrotation , anal atresia , internal hydrocephaly , anophthalmia , and fused bones .
The dose of 150 mg / kg / day in rabbits resulted in external fetal malformations ( partially opened eyes ) and minor blood vessel and skeletal variations .
In rats , malformations including micrognathia and persistent ductus arteriosus could be observed in the absence of maternal toxicity at doses equal to or greater than 30 and 80 mg / kg / day , approximately 5 % and 13 % of the MHRD , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary : There is no information regarding the presence of deferiprone in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , including the potential for tumorigenicity shown for deferiprone in animal studies , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with deferiprone tablets , and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing : Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating deferiprone tablets .
Contraception : Females : Deferiprone tablets can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with deferiprone tablets and for at least 6 months after the last dose .
Males : Based on genotoxicity findings , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with deferiprone tablets and for at least 3 months after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of deferiprone tablets for the treatment of transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes have been established in pediatric patients 8 years of age and older .
Use of deferiprone tablets for this indication is supported by evidence of efficacy from clinical trials in adult patients with thalassemia .
Safety and effectiveness of deferiprone tablets have not been established in pediatric patients with chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions who are less than 8 years of age .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of deferiprone did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE No cases of acute overdose have been reported .
There is no specific antidote to deferiprone tablets overdose .
Neurological disorders such as cerebellar symptoms , diplopia , lateral nystagmus , psychomotor slowdown , hand movements and axial hypotonia have been observed in children treated with 2 . 5 to 3 times the recommended dose for more than one year .
The neurological disorders progressively regressed after deferiprone discontinuation .
11 DESCRIPTION Deferiprone tablets contain 1 , 000 mg deferiprone ( 3 - hydroxy - 1 , 2 - dimethylpyridin - 4 - one ) , a synthetic , orally active , iron - chelating agent .
The molecular formula for deferiprone is C7H9NO2 and its molecular weight is 139 . 15 g / mol .
Deferiprone has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Deferiprone is a white crystalline powder .
It is slightly soluble in deionized water and has a melting point range of 271 ° C - 273 ° C . Deferiprone Tablets ( three times a day ) , 1 , 000 mg : Deferiprone tablets , 1 , 000 mg are white to off - white , modified capsule shaped , biconvex , film coated tablet , debossed with 54 [ score ] 23 on one side and plain on the other .
The tablets can be broken in half along the score line .
Each tablet contains 1 , 000 mg deferiprone and the following inactive ingredients : Tablet core : methylcellulose , crospovidone , magnesium stearate ; Coating : hypromellose , polyethylene glycol , polysorbate 80 , and titanium dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Deferiprone is a chelating agent with an affinity for ferric ions ( iron III ) .
Deferiprone binds with ferric ions to form neutral 3 : 1 ( deferiprone : iron ) complexes that are stable at physiological pH . 12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics No clinical studies were performed to assess the relationship between the dose of deferiprone and the amount of iron eliminated from the body .
Cardiac Electrophysiology : At the maximum approved recommended dose , deferiprone does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Deferiprone Tablets ( three times a day ) , 1 , 000 mg : The mean Cmax and AUC of deferiprone was 20 mcg / mL and 50 mcg ∙ h / mL , respectively , in healthy subjects .
The dose proportionality of deferiprone over the approved recommended dosage range is unknown .
Absorption : Deferiprone appeared in the blood within 5 to 10 minutes after oral administration .
Peak serum concentration of deferiprone was reached approximately 1 to 2 hours after a single dose .
Effect of Food : No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone were observed following administration with food .
Elimination : The elimination half - life of deferiprone is approximately 2 hours .
Metabolism : Deferiprone is metabolized primarily by UGT1A6 .
The major metabolite of deferiprone is the 3 - O - glucuronide , which lacks iron binding capability .
Excretion : Following oral administration , 75 % to 90 % of the administered dose was recovered in urine ( primarily as metabolite ) in the first 24 hours .
Specific Populations : No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone were observed based on sex , race / ethnicity , body weight , mild to severe ( eGFR 15 to 89 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) renal impairment , or mild ( Child Pugh Class A ) to moderate ( Child Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment .
The effect of age , including geriatric or pediatric populations , end stage renal disease or severe ( Child Pugh Class C ) hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone is unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies : In Vitro Studies : UGT1A6 Inhibitors : Phenylbutazone ( UGT1A6 inhibitor ) decreased glucuronidation of deferiprone by up to 78 % .
Polyvalent Cations : Deferiprone has the potential to bind polyvalent cations ( e . g . , iron , aluminum , and zinc ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with deferiprone .
However , in view of the genotoxicity results , and the findings of mammary gland hyperplasia and mammary gland tumors in rats treated with deferiprone in the 52 - week toxicology study , tumor formation in carcinogenicity studies must be regarded as likely .
Deferiprone was positive in a mouse lymphoma cell assay in vitro .
Deferiprone was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration test in mice and in a chromosomal aberration test in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells .
Deferiprone given orally or intraperitoneally was clastogenic in a bone marrow micronucleus assay in non - iron - loaded mice .
A micronucleus test was also positive when mice predosed with iron dextran were treated with deferiprone .
Deferiprone was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation test .
A fertility and early embryonic development study of deferiprone was conducted in rats .
Sperm counts , motility and morphology were unaffected by treatment with deferiprone .
There were no effects observed on male or female fertility or reproductive function at the highest dose which was 25 % of the MRHD .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Transfusional Iron Overload in Patients with Thalassemia Syndromes In a prospective , planned , pooled analysis of patients with thalassemia syndromes from several studies , the efficacy of deferiprone was assessed in transfusion - dependent iron overload patients in whom previous iron chelation therapy had failed or was considered inadequate due to poor tolerance .
The main criterion for chelation failure was serum ferritin > 2 , 500 mcg / L before treatment with deferiprone .
Deferiprone therapy ( 35 - 99 mg / kg / day ) was considered successful in individual patients who experienced a ≥ 20 % decline in serum ferritin within one year of starting therapy .
Data from a total of 236 patients were analyzed .
Of the 224 patients with thalassemia who received deferiprone monotherapy and were eligible for serum ferritin analysis , 105 ( 47 % ) were male and 119 ( 53 % ) were female .
The mean age of these patients was 18 . 2 years ( range 2 to 62 ; 91 patients were < 17 ) .
For the patients in the analysis , the endpoint of at least a 20 % reduction in serum ferritin was met in 50 % ( of 236 subjects ) , with a 95 % confidence interval of 43 % to 57 % .
A small number of patients with thalassemia and iron overload were assessed by measuring the change in the number of milliseconds ( ms ) in the cardiac MRI T2 * value before and after treatment with deferiprone for one year .
There was an increase in cardiac MRI T2 * from a mean at baseline of 11 . 8 ± 4 . 9 ms to a mean of 15 . 1 ± 7 . 0 ms after approximately one year of treatment .
The clinical significance of this observation is not known .
