3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Oral suspension : barium sulfate ( 40 % w / v ) supplied in a multiple - dose plastic bottle as a ready - to - use suspension for oral administration .
Each bottle contains 250 mL of suspension .
Oral suspension : barium sulfate ( 40 % w / v ) supplied in a multiple - dose bottle for oral administration ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS VARIBAR THIN HONEY is contraindicated in patients with : • known or suspected perforation of the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract • known obstruction of the GI tract • high risk of GI perforation such as those with a recent GI perforation , acute GI hemorrhage or ischemia , toxic megacolon , severe ileus , post GI surgery or biopsy , acute GI injury or burn , or recent radiotherapy to the pelvis • high risk of aspiration such as those with known or suspected tracheo - esophageal fistula or obtundation • known severe hypersensitivity to barium sulfate or any of the excipients of VARIBAR THIN HONEY • Known or suspected perforation of the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract ( 4 ) • Known obstruction of the GI tract ( 4 ) • Conditions associated with high risk of GI perforation or aspiration ( 4 ) • Known hypersensitivity to barium sulfate or any of the excipients of VARIBAR THIN HONEY ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity reactions : Emergency equipment and trained personnel should be immediately available ( 5 . 1 ) • Intra - abdominal leakage : May occur in conditions such as GI fistula , ulcer , inflammatory bowel disease , appendicitis or diverticulitis , severe stenosis or obstructing lesions of the GI tract ( 5 . 2 ) • Delayed GI transit and obstruction : Patients should maintain adequate hydration in days following barium sulfate procedure to avoid obstruction or impaction ( 5 . 3 ) • Aspiration pneumonitis : Aspiration may occur during the modified barium swallow examination , monitor the patient for aspiration ( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Barium sulfate preparations contain a number of excipients , including natural and artificial flavors and may induce serious hypersensitivity reactions .
The manifestations include hypotension , bronchospasm and other respiratory impairments , and dermal reactions including rashes , urticaria and itching .
A history of bronchial asthma , atopy , food allergies , or a previous reaction to a contrast agent may increase the risk for hypersensitivity reactions .
Emergency equipment and trained personnel should be immediately available for treatment of a hypersensitivity reaction .
5 . 2 Intra - abdominal Barium Leakage The use of VARIBAR THIN HONEY is contraindicated in patients at high risk of perforation of the GI tract [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Administration of VARIBAR THIN HONEY may result in leakage of barium from the GI tract in the presence of conditions such as carcinomas , GI fistula , inflammatory bowel disease , gastric or duodenal ulcer , appendicitis , or diverticulitis , and in patients with a severe stenosis at any level of the GI tract , especially if it is distal to the stomach .
The barium leakage has been associated with peritonitis and granuloma formation .
5 . 3 Delayed Gastrointestinal Transit and Obstruction Orally administered barium sulfate may accumulate proximal to a constricting lesion of the colon , causing obstruction or impaction with development of baroliths ( inspissated barium associated with feces ) and may lead to abdominal pain , appendicitis , bowel obstruction , or rarely perforation .
Patients with the following conditions are at higher risk for developing obstruction or baroliths : severe stenosis at any level of the GI tract , impaired GI motility , electrolyte imbalance , dehydration , on a low residue diet , taking medications that delay GI motility , constipation , pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease , and the elderly [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 , 8 . 5 ) ] .
To reduce the risk of delayed GI transit and obstruction , patients should maintain adequate hydration after the barium sulfate procedure .
5 . 4 Aspiration Pneumonitis The use of VARIBAR THIN HONEY is contraindicated in patients with trachea - esophageal fistula [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Oral administration of barium is associated with aspiration pneumonitis , especially in patients with a history of food aspiration or with compromised swallowing mechanism .
Vomiting following oral administration of barium sulfate may lead to aspiration pneumonitis .
In patients at risk for aspiration , begin the procedure with a small ingested volume of VARIBAR THIN HONEY .
Monitor the patient closely for aspiration , discontinue administration of VARIBAR THIN HONEY if aspiration is suspected , and monitor for development of aspiration pneumonitis .
5 . 5 Systemic Embolization Barium sulfate products may occasionally intravasate into the venous drainage of the GI tract and enter the circulation as a " barium embolus " leading to potentially fatal complications which include systemic and pulmonary embolism , disseminated intravascular coagulation , septicemia and prolonged severe hypotension .
Although this complication is exceedingly uncommon after oral administration of a barium sulfate suspension , monitor patients for potential intravasation when administering barium sulfate .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous reporting or clinical studies of barium sulfate administered orally .
Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure : • Nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and abdominal cramping • Serious adverse reactions and fatalities include aspiration pneumonitis , barium sulfate impaction , intestinal perforation with consequent peritonitis and granuloma formation , vasovagal and syncopal episodes Common adverse reactions include nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and abdominal cramp ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Bracco Diagnostics Inc at 1 - 800 - 257 - 5181 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary VARIBAR THIN HONEY is not absorbed systemically following oral administration , and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary VARIBAR THIN HONEY is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration , and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the infant to the drug .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The efficacy of VARIBAR THIN HONEY in pediatric patients is based on successful opacification of the pharynx during modified barium swallow examinations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Safety and dosing recommendations in pediatric patients are based on clinical experience .
VARIBAR THIN HONEY is contraindicated in pediatric patients with trachea - esophageal fistula .
[ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Pediatric patients with a history of asthma or food allergies may be at increased risk for development of hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor patients with cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease for bowel obstruction after use [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of VARIBAR THIN HONEY did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
11 DESCRIPTION VARIBAR THIN HONEY ( barium sulfate ) is a radiographic contrast agent that is supplied as an off - white to lightly colored suspension ( 40 % w / v ) with an apple aroma for oral administration .
The active ingredient barium sulfate is designated chemically as BaSO4 with a molecular weight of 233 . 4 g / mol , a density of 4 . 5 g / cm3 , and the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] VARIBAR THIN HONEY has a viscosity of 1500 cPs and contains the following excipients : carboxymethylcellulose sodium , citric acid , glycerin , natural and artificial apple flavor , polysorbate 80 , potassium sorbate , purified water , saccharin sodium , simethicone emulsion , sodium benzoate , sodium citrate , starch modified ( from corn ) , xanthan gum , and xylitol .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Due to its high atomic number , barium ( the active ingredient in VARIBAR THIN HONEY ) is opaque to x - rays and therefore acts as a positive contrast agent for radiographic studies .
