( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Hypersensitivity to any component of this product .
( 4 . 1 ) • Neonates and infants ( Under the Age of two Years ) .
( 4 . 2 ) 4 . 1 Hypersensitivity SIMBRINZA is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product .
4 . 2 Neonates and Infants ( Under the Age of Two Years ) SIMBRINZA is contraindicated in neonates and infants ( under the age of two years ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Potential for sulfonamide hypersensitivity reactions because of the brinzolamide component .
( 5 . 1 ) • Potential for corneal endothelium cell loss .
( 5 . 2 ) • Severe renal impairment may limit the metabolism of the brinzolamide component .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Sulfonamide Hypersensitivity Reactions SIMBRINZA contains brinzolamide , a sulfonamide , and although administered topically is absorbed systemically .
Therefore , the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulfonamides may occur with topical administration of SIMBRINZA .
Fatalities have occurred due to severe reactions to sulfonamides including Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis , fulminant hepatic necrosis , agranulocytosis , aplastic anemia , and other blood dyscrasias .
Sensitization may recur when a sulfonamide is re - administered irrespective of the route of administration .
If signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur , discontinue the use of this preparation [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 2 Corneal Endothelium Carbonic anhydrase activity has been observed in both the cytoplasm and around the plasma membranes of the corneal endothelium .
There is an increased potential for developing corneal edema in patients with low endothelial cell counts .
Caution should be used when prescribing SIMBRINZA to this group of patients .
5 . 3 Severe Renal Impairment SIMBRINZA has not been specifically studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( CrCl less than 30 mL / min ) .
Since brinzolamide and its metabolites are excreted predominantly by the kidney , SIMBRINZA is not recommended in such patients .
5 . 4 Acute Angle - Closure Glaucoma The management of patients with acute angle - closure glaucoma requires therapeutic interventions in addition to ocular hypotensive agents .
SIMBRINZA has not been studied in patients with acute angle - closure glaucoma .
5 . 5 Contact Lens Wear The preservative in SIMBRINZA , benzalkonium chloride , may be absorbed by soft contact lenses .
Contact lenses should be removed during instillation of SIMBRINZA but may be reinserted 15 minutes after instillation [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 6 Severe Cardiovascular Disease Brimonidine tartrate , a component of SIMBRINZA , has a less than 5 % mean decrease in blood pressure two hours after dosing in clinical studies ; caution should be exercised in treating patients with severe cardiovascular disease .
5 . 7 Severe Hepatic Impairment Because brimonidine tartrate , a component of SIMBRINZA , has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment , caution should be exercised in such patients .
5 . 8 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate , a component of SIMBRINZA , may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency .
SIMBRINZA should be used with caution in patients with depression , cerebral or coronary insufficiency , Raynaud ’ s phenomenon , orthostatic hypotension , or thromboangiitis obliterans .
5 . 9 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple - dose containers of topical ophthalmic products .
These containers have been inadvertently contaminated by patients who , in most cases , had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions occurring in approximately 3 % to 5 % of patients included blurred vision , eye irritation , dysgeusia ( bad taste ) , dry mouth , and eye allergy .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
SIMBRINZA In two clinical trials of three months duration 435 patients were treated with SIMBRINZA , and 915 were treated with the two individual components .
The most frequently reported adverse reactions in patients treated with SIMBRINZA occurring in approximately 3 % to 5 % of patients in descending order of incidence were blurred vision , eye irritation , dysgeusia ( bad taste ) , dry mouth , and eye allergy .
Rates of adverse reactions reported with the individual components were comparable .
Treatment discontinuation , mainly due to adverse reactions , was reported in 11 % of SIMBRINZA patients .
Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the individual components during clinical trials are listed below .
Brinzolamide 1 % In clinical trials of brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension 1 % , the most frequently reported adverse reactions reported in 5 % to 10 % of patients were blurred vision and bitter , sour or unusual taste .
Adverse reactions occurring in 1 % to 5 % of patients were blepharitis , dermatitis , dry eye , foreign body sensation , headache , hyperemia , ocular discharge , ocular discomfort , ocular keratitis , ocular pain , ocular pruritus , and rhinitis .
The following adverse reactions were reported at an incidence below 1 % : allergic reactions , alopecia , chest pain , conjunctivitis , diarrhea , diplopia , dizziness , dry mouth , dyspnea , dyspepsia , eye fatigue , hypertonia , keratoconjunctivitis , keratopathy , kidney pain , lid margin crusting or sticky sensation , nausea , pharyngitis , tearing , and urticaria .
Brimonidine Tartrate 0 . 2 % In clinical trials of brimonidine tartrate 0 . 2 % , adverse reactions occurring in approximately 10 % to 30 % of the subjects , in descending order of incidence , included oral dryness , ocular hyperemia , burning and stinging , headache , blurring , foreign body sensation , fatigue / drowsiness , conjunctival follicles , ocular allergic reactions , and ocular pruritus .
Reactions occurring in approximately 3 % to 9 % of the subjects , in descending order included corneal staining / erosion , photophobia , eyelid erythema , ocular ache / pain , ocular dryness , tearing , upper respiratory symptoms , eyelid edema , conjunctival edema , dizziness , blepharitis , ocular irritation , gastrointestinal symptoms , asthenia , conjunctival blanching , abnormal vision , and muscular pain .
The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 3 % of the patients : lid crusting , conjunctival hemorrhage , abnormal taste , insomnia , conjunctival discharge , depression , hypertension , anxiety , palpitations / arrhythmias , nasal dryness , and syncope .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions in clinical practice .
Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
The reactions , which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness , frequency of reporting , possible causal connection to brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions , or a combination of these factors , include : bradycardia , hypersensitivity , iritis , keratoconjunctivitis sicca , miosis , nausea , skin reactions ( including erythema , eyelid pruritus , rash , and vasodilation ) , and tachycardia .
Apnea , bradycardia , coma , hypotension , hypothermia , hypotonia , lethargy , pallor , respiratory depression , and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Oral Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors ( CAIs ) ( 7 . 1 ) • High - dose Salicylate Therapy ( 7 . 2 ) • Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Depressants ( 7 . 3 ) • Antihypertensives / Cardiac Glycosides ( 7 . 4 ) • Tricyclic Antidepressants ( 7 . 5 ) • Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ( MAOIs ) ( 7 . 6 ) 7 . 1 Oral Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors There is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension 1 % , a component of SIMBRINZA ophthalmic suspension .
The concomitant administration of SIMBRINZA and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended .
7 . 2 High - Dose Salicylate Therapy Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may produce acid - base and electrolyte alterations .
These alterations were not reported in the clinical trials with brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension 1 % .
However , in patients treated with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors , rare instances of acid - base alterations have occurred with high - dose salicylate therapy .
Therefore , the potential for such drug interactions should be considered in patients receiving SIMBRINZA .
7 . 3 Central Nervous System Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with SIMBRINZA , the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with central nervous system ( CNS ) depressants ( alcohol , opiates , barbiturates , sedatives , or anesthetics ) should be considered .
7 . 4 Antihypertensives / Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate , a component of SIMBRINZA , may reduce blood pressure , caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and / or cardiac glycosides with SIMBRINZA is advised .
7 . 5 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine .
It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with SIMBRINZA in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP lowering effect .
Caution is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants , which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines .
7 . 6 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine tartrate and potentially result in an increased systemic side - effect such as hypotension .
Caution is advised in patients taking MAOIs , which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C : Developmental toxicity studies with brinzolamide in rabbits at oral doses of 1 , 3 , and 6 mg / kg / day ( 20 , 60 , and 120 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose ) produced maternal toxicity at 6 mg / kg / day and a significant increase in the number of fetal variations , such as accessory skull bones , which was only slightly higher than the historic value at 1 and 6 mg / kg .
In rats , statistically decreased body weights of fetuses from dams receiving oral doses of 18 mg / kg / day ( 180 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose ) during gestation were proportional to the reduced maternal weight gain , with no statistically significant effects on organ or tissue development .
Increases in unossified sternebrae , reduced ossification of the skull , and unossified hyoid that occurred at 6 and 18 mg / kg were not statistically significant .
No treatment - related malformations were seen .
Following oral administration of 14 C - brinzolamide to pregnant rats , radioactivity was found to cross the placenta and was present in the fetal tissues and blood .
Developmental toxicity studies performed in rats with oral doses of 0 . 66 mg brimonidine base / kg revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus .
Dosing at this level resulted in a plasma drug concentration approximately 100 times higher than that seen in humans at the recommended human ophthalmic dose .
In animal studies , brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
SIMBRINZA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers In a study of brinzolamide in lactating rats , decreases in body weight gain in offspring at an oral dose of 15 mg / kg / day ( 150 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose ) were observed during lactation .
No other effects were observed .
However , following oral administration of 14 C - brinzolamide to lactating rats , radioactivity was found in milk at concentrations below those in the blood and plasma .
In animal studies , brimonidine was excreted in breast milk .
It is not known whether brinzolamide and brimonidine tartrate are excreted in human milk following topical ocular administration .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from SIMBRINZA , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The individual component , brinzolamide , has been studied in pediatric glaucoma patients 4 weeks to 5 years of age .
The individual component , brimonidine tartrate , has been studied in pediatric patients two to seven years old .
Somnolence ( 50 % to 83 % ) and decreased alertness was seen in patients two to six years old .
SIMBRINZA is contraindicated in children under the age of two years [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and adult patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE Although no human data are available , electrolyte imbalance , development of an acidotic state , and possible nervous system effects may occur following an oral overdose of brinzolamide .
Serum electrolyte levels ( particularly potassium ) and blood pH levels should be monitored .
Very limited information exists on accidental ingestion of brimonidine in adults ; the only adverse event reported to date has been hypotension .
Symptoms of brimonidine overdose have been reported in neonates , infants , and children receiving brimonidine as part of medical treatment of congenital glaucoma or by accidental oral ingestion .
Treatment of an oral overdose includes supportive and symptomatic therapy ; a patent airway should be maintained .
11 DESCRIPTION SIMBRINZA is a fixed combination of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and an alpha - 2 adrenergic receptor agonist .
Brinzolamide is described chemically as : ( R ) - ( + ) - 4 - Ethylamino - 2 - ( 3 - methoxypropyl ) - 3 , 4 - dihydro - 2 H - thieno [ 3 , 2 - e ] - 1 , 2 - thiazine - 6 - sulfonamide - 1 , 1 - dioxide .
Its empirical formula is C12H21N3O5S3 , and its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Brinzolamide has a molecular weight of 383 . 5 g / mol .
It is a white powder , which is insoluble in water , very soluble in methanol and soluble in ethanol .
Brimonidine tartrate is described chemically as : 5 - bromo - 6 - ( 2 - imidazolidinylideneamino ) quinoxaline L - tartrate .
Its empirical formula of C11H10BrN5 – C4H6O6 and its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Brimonidine tartrate has a molecular weight of 442 . 2 g / mol .
It is a white to yellow powder that is soluble in water ( 34 mg / mL ) at pH 6 . 5 .
SIMBRINZA is supplied as a sterile , aqueous suspension which has been formulated to be readily suspended following shaking .
It has a pH of approximately 6 . 5 and an osmolality of approximately 270 mOsm / kg .
Each mL of SIMBRINZA contains : Active ingredients : brinzolamide 10 mg , brimonidine tartrate 2 mg ( equivalent to 1 . 32 mg as brimonidine free base ) ; Preservative : benzalkonium chloride 0 . 03 mg ; Inactive ingredients : boric acid , carbomer 974 P , mannitol , propylene glycol , purified water , sodium chloride , and tyloxapol .
Hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH . [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action SIMBRINZA is comprised of two components : brinzolamide ( carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ) and brimonidine tartrate ( alpha - 2 adrenergic receptor agonist ) .
Each of these two components decreases elevated IOP .
Elevated IOP is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss .
The higher the level of IOP , the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage .
Brinzolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye to decrease aqueous humor secretion , presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport .
Brinzolamide has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two to three hours post - dosing .
Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow .
Brimonidine tartrate has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post - dosing .
The result is a reduction in IOP .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following topical ocular administration , brinzolamide is absorbed into the systemic circulation .
Due to its affinity for CA - II , brinzolamide distributes extensively into the red blood cells ( RBCs ) and exhibits a long half - life in whole blood ( approximately 111 days ) .
In humans , the metabolite N - desethyl brinzolamide is formed , which also binds to CA and accumulates in RBCs .
This metabolite binds mainly to CA - I in the presence of brinzolamide .
In plasma , both parent brinzolamide and N - desethyl brinzolamide concentrations are less than 10 ng / mL .
Binding to plasma proteins is approximately 60 % .
Brinzolamide is eliminated predominantly in the urine as unchanged drug .
N - Desethyl brinzolamide is also found in the urine along with lower concentrations of the N - desmethoxypropyl and O - desmethyl metabolites .
After ocular administration of a 0 . 2 % solution of brimonidine tartrate , plasma concentrations peaked within one to four hours and declined with a systemic half - life of approximately three hours .
In humans , systemic metabolism of brimonidine is extensive .
It is metabolized primarily by the liver .
Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of the drug and its metabolites .
Approximately 87 % of an orally - administered radioactive dose was eliminated within 120 hours , with 74 % found in the urine .
In humans , a study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the fixed combination of brinzolamide and brimonidine tartrate 1 % and 0 . 2 % ophthalmic suspension .
Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive twice or three times a day either the fixed combination , or either of its individual components , brinzolamide or brimonidine .
Subjects who were assigned to the brinzolamide alone or combination arms were administered oral brinzolamide capsules for two weeks prior to beginning dosing with the topical ocular suspension .
The results demonstrate that the systemic plasma exposure ( area under the curve [ AUC ) ] and Cmax ) to brinzolamide and brimonidine in humans is similar after dosing with the fixed combination to that observed following dosing with the individual components .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Brinzolamide caused urinary bladder tumors in female mice at oral doses of 10 mg / kg / day and in male rats at oral doses of 8 mg / kg / day in two year studies .
Brinzolamide was not carcinogenic in male mice or female rats dosed orally for up to two years .
The carcinogenicity appears secondary to kidney and urinary bladder toxicity .
These levels of exposure cannot be achieved with topical ophthalmic dosing in humans .
The following tests for mutagenic potential of brinzolamide were negative : ( 1 ) in vivo mouse micronucleus assay ; ( 2 ) in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay ; and ( 3 ) Ames E . coli test .
The in vitro mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay was negative in the absence of activation , but positive in the presence of microsomal activation .
In this assay , there was no consistent dose - response relationship to the increased mutation frequency and cytotoxicity likely contributed to the high mutation frequency .
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors , as a class , are not mutagenic and the weight of evidence supports that brinzolamide is consistent with the class .
In reproduction studies of brinzolamide in rats , there were no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive capacity of males or females at doses up to 18 mg / kg / day ( 180 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose ) .
Brimonidine tartrate was not carcinogenic in either a 21 - month mouse or 24 - month rat study .
In these studies , dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2 . 5 mg / kg / day in mice and 1 mg / kg / day in rats resulted in plasma drug concentrations 80 and 120 times higher than the human plasma drug level at the recommended clinical dose , respectively .
Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or cytogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames test , chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells , a host - mediated assay and cytogenic studies in mice , and a dominant lethal assay .
In reproductive studies performed in rats with oral doses of 0 . 66 mg brimonidine base / kg ( approximately 100 times the plasma drug concentration level seen in humans following multiple ophthalmic doses ) , fertility was not impaired .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two clinical trials of three months duration were conducted in patients with open - angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension to compare the IOP - lowering effect of SIMBRINZA dosed three times daily to individually administered 1 % brinzolamide three times daily and 0 . 2 % brimonidine tartrate three times daily .
Mean IOP values at baseline are presented in Table 1 .
