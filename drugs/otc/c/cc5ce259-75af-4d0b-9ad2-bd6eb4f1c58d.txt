EXTERNAL RADIATION The specific gamma ray constant for Technetium Tc 99 m is 0 . 78 R / mCi - hr at 1 cm .
The first half - value thickness of lead ( Pb ) for Technetium Tc 99 m is 0 . 017 cm .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2 .
For example , the use of 0 . 25 cm of Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of about 1000 .

Blood levels are about 10 % of the injected dose at one hour post - injection and continue to fall to about 6 % , 4 % and 3 % at 2 , 3 and 4 hours , respectively .
When measured at 24 hours following its administration , skeletal retention is approximately 50 % of the injected dose .
Technescan HDP exhibits its greatest affinity for areas of altered osteogenesis and actively metabolizing bone .

It is also not known whether Technetium Tc 99 m Oxidronate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Technetium Tc 99 m Oxidronate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Ideally , examinations using radiopharmaceuticals , especially those elective in nature , of a woman of childbearing capability should be performed during the first few ( approximately 10 ) days following the onset of menses .
Nursing Mothers Technetium Tc 99 m is excreted in human milk during lactation , therefore formula feedings should be substituted for breast feedings .
Overdose In the event of the administration of an overdose with Technescan HDP , encourage patients to drink fluids and void frequently to reduce the radiation dose to the patient .
