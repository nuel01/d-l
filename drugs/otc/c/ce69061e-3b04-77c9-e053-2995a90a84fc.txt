[ MULTIMEDIA ] 11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Fluorine [ 18 - F ] decays by emitting a positron to Oxygen [ O - 16 ] ( stable ) and has a physical half - life of 109 . 7 minutes .
The principal photons useful for imaging are the dual 511 keV gamma photons , that are produced and emitted simultaneously in opposite directions when the positron interacts with an electron ( Table 2 ) .

The range of attenuation coefficients for this radionuclide as a function of lead shield thickness is shown in Table 3 .
For example , the interposition of an 8 mm thickness of Pb , with a coefficient of attenuation of 0 . 25 , will decrease the external radiation by 75 % .

Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported through the cell membrane by facilitative glucose transporter proteins and is phosphorylated within the cell to [ 18 F ] FDG - 6 - phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase .
Once phosphorylated it cannot exit until it is dephosphorylated by glucose - 6 - phosphatase .
Therefore , within a given tissue or pathophysiological process , the retention and clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect a balance involving glucose transporter , hexokinase and glucose - 6 - phosphatase activities .
When allowance is made for the kinetic differences between glucose and Fludeoxyglucose F 18 transport and phosphorylation ( expressed as the '' lumped constant '' ratio ) , Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is used to assess glucose metabolism .
In comparison to background activity of the specific organ or tissue type , regions of decreased or absent uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect the decrease or absence of glucose metabolism .
Regions of increased uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect greater than normal rates of glucose metabolism .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection is rapidly distributed to all organs of the body after intravenous administration .
After background clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection , optimal PET imaging is generally achieved between 30 to 40 minutes after administration .
In cancer , the cells are generally characterized by enhanced glucose metabolism partially due to ( 1 ) an increase in activity of glucose transporters , ( 2 ) an increased rate of phosphorylation activity , ( 3 ) a reduction of phosphatase activity or , ( 4 ) a dynamic alteration in the balance among all these processes .
However , glucose metabolism of cancer as reflected by Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation shows considerable variability .
Depending on tumor type , stage , and location , Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation may be increased , normal , or decreased .
Also , inflammatory cells can have the same variability of uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 .
In the heart , under normal aerobic conditions , the myocardium meets the bulk of its energy requirements by oxidizing free fatty acids .
Most of the exogenous glucose taken up by the myocyte is converted into glycogen .
However , under ischemic conditions , the oxidation of free fatty acids decreases , exogenous glucose becomes the preferred myocardial substrate , glycolysis is stimulated , and glucose taken up by the myocyte is metabolized immediately instead of being converted into glycogen .
Under these conditions , phosphorylated Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulates in the myocyte and can be detected with PET imaging .
In the brain , cells normally rely on aerobic metabolism .
In epilepsy , the glucose metabolism varies .
Generally , during a seizure , glucose metabolism increases .
Interictally , the seizure focus tends to be hypometabolic .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution : In four healthy male volunteers , receiving an intravenous administration of 30 seconds in duration , the arterial blood level profile for Fludeoxyglucose F 18 decayed tri - exponentially .
The effective half - life ranges of the three phases were 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 minutes , 10 - 13 minutes with a mean and standard deviation ( STD ) of 11 . 6 ( ± ) 1 . 1 min , and 80 - 95 minutes with a mean and STD of 88 ( ± ) 4 min .
Plasma protein binding of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 has not been studied .
Metabolism : Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported into cells and phosphorylated to [ 18 F ] - FDG - 6 - phosphate at a rate proportional to the rate of glucose utilization within that tissue .
[ F 18 ] - FDG - 6 - phosphate presumably is metabolized to 2 - deoxy - 2 - [ F 18 ] fluoro - 6 - phospho - D - mannose ( [ F 18 ] FDM - 6 - phosphate ) .
Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection may contain several impurities ( e . g . , 2 - deoxy - 2 - chloro - D - glucose ( ClDG ) ) .
Biodistribution and metabolism of ClDG are presumed to be similar to Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and would be expected to result in intracellular formation of 2 - deoxy - 2 - chloro - 6 - phospho - D - glucose ( ClDG - 6 - phosphate ) and 2 - deoxy - 2 - chloro - 6 - phospho - D - mannose ( ClDM - 6 - phosphate ) .
The phosphorylated deoxyglucose compounds are dephosphorylated and the resulting compounds ( FDG , FDM , ClDG , and ClDM ) presumably leave cells by passive diffusion .
Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and related compounds are cleared from non - cardiac tissues within 3 to 24 hours after administration .
Clearance from the cardiac tissue may require more than 96 hours .
Fludeoxyglucose F 18 that is not involved in glucose metabolism in any tissue is then excreted in the urine .
Elimination : Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is cleared from most tissues within 24 hours and can be eliminated from the body unchanged in the urine .
Three elimination phases have been identified in the reviewed literature .
Within 33 minutes , a mean of 3 . 9 % of the administrated radioactive dose was measured in the urine .
The amount of radiation exposure of the urinary bladder at two hours post administration suggests that 20 . 6 % ( mean ) of the radioactive dose was present in the bladder .
Special Populations : The pharmacokinetics of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection have not been studied in renally - impaired , hepatically impaired or pediatric patients .
Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is eliminated through the renal system .
Avoid excessive radiation exposure to this organ system and adjacent tissues .
The effects of fasting , varying blood sugar levels , conditions of glucose intolerance , and diabetes mellitus on Fludeoxyglucose F 18 distribution in humans have not been ascertained [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effects on fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Oncology The efficacy of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection in positron emission tomography cancer imaging was demonstrated in 16 independent studies .
These studies prospectively evaluated the use of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 in patients with suspected or known malignancies , including non - small cell lung cancer , colo - rectal , pancreatic , breast , thyroid , melanoma , Hodgkin ' s and non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma , and various types of metastatic cancers to lung , liver , bone , and axillary nodes .
All these studies had at least 50 patients and used pathology as a standard of truth .
The Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection doses in the studies ranged from 200 MBq to 740 MBq ( 5 . 4 – 20 mCi ) with a median and mean dose of 370 MBq ( 10 mCi ) .
In the studies , the diagnostic performance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection varied with the type of cancer , size of cancer , and other clinical conditions .
False negative and false positive scans were observed .
Negative Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection PET scans do not exclude the diagnosis of cancer .
Positive Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection PET scans can not replace pathology to establish a diagnosis of cancer .
Non - malignant conditions such as fungal infections , inflammatory processes and benign tumors have patterns of increased glucose metabolism that may give rise to false - positive scans .
The efficacy of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection PET imaging in cancer screening was not studied .
14 . 2 Cardiology The efficacy of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection for cardiac use was demonstrated in ten independent , prospective studies of patients with coronary artery disease and chronic left ventricular systolic dysfunction who were scheduled to undergo coronary revascularization .
Before revascularization , patients underwent PET imaging with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection ( 74 – 370 MBq , 2 – 10 mCi ) and perfusion imaging with other diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals .
Doses of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection ranged from 74 - 370 MBq ( 2 - 10 mCi ) .
Segmental , left ventricular , wall - motion assessments of asynergic areas made before revascularization were compared in a blinded manner to assessments made after successful revascularization to identify myocardial segments with functional recovery .
Left ventricular myocardial segments were predicted to have reversible loss of systolic function if they showed Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation and reduced perfusion ( i . e . , flow - metabolism mismatch ) .
Conversely , myocardial segments were predicted to have irreversible loss of systolic function if they showed reductions in both Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation and perfusion ( i . e . , matched defects ) .
Findings of flow - metabolism mismatch in a myocardial segment may suggest that successful revascularization will restore myocardial function in that segment .
However , false - positive tests occur regularly , and the decision to have a patient undergo revascularization should not be based on PET findings alone .
Similarly , findings of a matched defect in a myocardial segment may suggest that myocardial function will not recover in that segment , even if it is successfully re - vascularized .
However , false - negative tests occur regularly , and the decision to recommend against coronary revascularization , or to recommend a cardiac transplant , should not be based on PET findings alone .
The reversibility of segmental dysfunction as predicted with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET imaging depends on successful coronary revascularization .
Therefore , in patients with a low likelihood of successful revascularization , the diagnostic usefulness of PET imaging with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection is more limited .
14 . 3 Neurology In a prospective , open label trial , Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection was evaluated in 86 patients with epilepsy .
Each patient received a dose of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection in the range of 185 - 370 MBq ( 5 - 10 mCi ) .
The mean age was 16 . 4 years ( range : 4 months - 58 years ; of these , 42 patients were less than 12 years and 16 patients were less than 2 years old ) .
Patients had a known diagnosis of complex partial epilepsy and were under evaluation for surgical treatment of their seizure disorder .
Seizure foci had been previously identified on ictal EEGs and sphenoidal EEGs .
Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection PET imaging confirmed previous diagnostic findings in 16 % ( 14 / 87 ) of the patients ; in 34 % ( 30 / 87 ) of the patients , Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection PET images provided new findings .
In 32 % ( 27 / 87 ) , imaging with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection was inconclusive .
The impact of these imaging findings on clinical outcomes is not known .
Several other studies comparing imaging with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection results to subsphenoidal EEG , MRI and / or surgical findings supported the concept that the degree of hypometabolism corresponds to areas of confirmed epileptogenic foci .
The safety and effectiveness of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection to distinguish idiopathic epileptogenic foci from tumors or other brain lesions that may cause seizures have not been established .
