6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The most common ocular adverse reaction observed in controlled clinical studies with RHOPRESSA dosed once daily was conjunctival hyperemia which was reported in 53 % of patients .
Six percent of patients discontinued therapy due to conjunctival hyperemia .
Other common ( approximately 20 % ) ocular adverse reactions reported were : corneal verticillata , instillation site pain , and conjunctival hemorrhage .
Instillation site erythema , corneal staining , blurred vision , increased lacrimation , erythema of eyelid , and reduced visual acuity were reported in 5 - 10 % of patients .
Corneal Verticillata Corneal verticillata occurred in approximately 20 % of the patients in controlled clinical studies .
The corneal verticillata seen in RHOPRESSA - treated patients were first noted at 4 weeks of daily dosing .
This reaction did not result in any apparent visual functional changes in patients .
Most corneal verticillata resolved upon discontinuation of treatment .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on RHOPRESSA use in pregnant women to inform any drug associated risk ; however , systemic exposure to netarsudil from ocular administration is low [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intravenous administration of netarsudil to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis did not produce adverse embryofetal effects at clinically relevant systemic exposures [ see Data ] .
Data Animal Data Netarsudil administered daily by intravenous injection to rats during organogenesis caused abortions and embryofetal lethality at doses ≥ 0 . 3 mg / kg / day ( 126 - fold the plasma exposure at the recommended human ophthalmic dose [ RHOD ] , based on Cmax ) .
The no - observed - adverse - effect - level ( NOAEL ) for embryofetal development toxicity was 0 . 1 mg / kg / day ( 40 - fold the plasma exposure at the RHOD , based on Cmax ) .
Netarsudil administered daily by intravenous injection to rabbits during organogenesis caused embryofetal lethality and decreased fetal weight at 5 mg / kg / day ( 1480 - fold the plasma exposure at the RHOD , based on Cmax ) .
Malformations were observed at ≥ 3 mg / kg / day ( 1330 - fold the plasma exposure at the RHOD , based on Cmax ) , including thoracogastroschisis , umbilical hernia and absent intermediate lung lobe .
The NOAEL for embryofetal development toxicity was 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( 214 - fold the plasma exposure at the RHOD , based on Cmax ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of RHOPRESSA in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
However , systemic exposure to netarsudil following topical ocular administration is low [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , and it is not known whether measurable levels of netarsudil would be present in maternal milk following topical ocular administration .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for RHOPRESSA and any potential adverse effects on the breast - fed child from RHOPRESSA .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients .
11 DESCRIPTION Netarsudil is a Rho kinase inhibitor .
Its chemical name is ( S ) - 4 - ( 3 - amino - 1 - ( isoquinolin - 6 - yl - amino ) - 1 - oxopropan - 2 - yl ) benzyl 2 , 4 - dimethylbenzoate dimesylate .
The molecular formula of the free base is C28H27N3O3 and the molecular formula of the dimesylate is C30H35N3O9S2 .
The molecular weight of the free base is 453 . 54 and the molecular weight of the dimesylate is 645 . 74 .
The chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Netarsudil dimesylate is a light yellow - to - white powder that is freely soluble in water , soluble in methanol , sparingly soluble in dimethyl formamide , and practically insoluble in dichloromethane and heptane .
RHOPRESSA ( netarsudil ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 02 % is supplied as a sterile , isotonic , buffered aqueous solution of netarsudil dimesylate with a pH of approximately 5 and an osmolality of approximately 295 mOsmol / kg .
It is intended for topical application in the eye .
Each mL of RHOPRESSA contains 0 . 2 mg of netarsudil ( equivalent to 0 . 28 mg of netarsudil dimesylate ) .
Benzalkonium chloride , 0 . 015 % , is added as a preservative .
The inactive ingredients are : boric acid , mannitol , sodium hydroxide to adjust pH , and water for injection .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Netarsudil is a rho kinase inhibitor , which is believed to reduce IOP by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork , and through the reduction of episcleral venous pressure ( EVP ) .
The exact mechanism is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The systemic exposures of netarsudil and its active metabolite , AR - 13503 , were evaluated in 18 healthy subjects after topical ocular administration of RHOPRESSA 0 . 02 % once daily ( one drop bilaterally in the morning ) for 8 days .
There were no quantifiable plasma concentrations of netarsudil ( lower limit of quantitation ( LLOQ ) 0 . 100 ng / mL ) post dose on Day 1 and Day 8 .
Only one plasma concentration at 0 . 11 ng / mL for the active metabolite was observed for one subject on Day 8 at 8 hours post - dose .
Metabolism After topical ocular dosing , netarsudil is metabolized by esterases in the eye .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of netarsudil .
Netarsudil was not mutagenic in the Ames test , in the mouse lymphoma test , or in the in vivo rat micronucleus test .
Studies to evaluate the effects of netarsudil on male or female fertility in animals have not been performed .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES RHOPRESSA 0 . 02 % was evaluated in three randomized and controlled clinical trials , namely AR - 13324 - CS301 ( NCT 02207491 , referred to as Study 301 ) , AR - 13324 - CS302 ( NCT 02207621 , referred to as Study 302 ) , and AR - 13324 - CS304 ( NCT 02558374 , referred to as Study 304 ) , in patients with open - angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension .
Studies 301 and 302 enrolled subjects with baseline IOP lower than 27 mmHg and Study 304 enrolled subjects with baseline IOP lower than 30 mmHg .
The treatment duration was 3 months in Study 301 , 12 months in Study 302 , and 6 months in Study 304 .
The three studies demonstrated up to 5 mmHg reductions in IOP for subjects treated with RHOPRESSA 0 . 02 % once daily in the evening .
For patients with baseline IOP < 25 mmHg , the IOP reductions with RHOPRESSA 0 . 02 % dosed once daily were similar to those with timolol 0 . 5 % dosed twice daily ( see Table 1 ) .
For patients with baseline IOP equal to or above 25 mmHg , however , RHOPRESSA 0 . 02 % resulted in smaller mean IOP reductions at the morning time points than timolol 0 . 5 % for study visits on Days 43 and 90 ; the difference in mean IOP reduction between the two treatment groups was as high as 3 mmHg , favoring timolol .
Table 1 : Mean IOP Change from Baseline of Study Eye ( mmHg ) by Visit and Time [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] This table was produced based on the observed data from all randomized subjects who did not have major protocol violations .
The treatment differences and two - sided CIs for comparing Rhopressa QD vs Timolol BID 0 . 5 % were based on Analysis of Covariance ( ANCOVA ) adjusted for baseline IOP .
