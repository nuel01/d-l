5 . 7 Carcinogenicity Like many alkylating agents , thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [ see Nonclinical Toxicity ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice , but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man .
There is an increased risk of a secondary malignancy with use of thiotepa .
5 . 8 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals , thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of thiotepa in pregnant women .
Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal ( IP ) route was teratogenic in mice at doses ≥ 1 mg / kg ( 3 . 2 mg / m2 ) , approximately 8 - fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose ( 0 . 8 mg / kg , 27 mg / m2 ) , based on body - surface area .
Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses ≥ 3 mg / kg ( 21 mg / m2 ) , approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose , based on body - surface area .
Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg / kg ( 41 mg / m2 ) , approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body - surface area .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Effect of Cytochrome CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 to its active metabolite TEPA .
Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , itraconazole , clarithromycin , ritonavir ) and strong CYP3A4 inducers ( e . g . , rifampin , phenytoin ) with thiotepa due to the potential effects on efficacy and toxicity [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Consider alternative medications with no or minimal potential to inhibit or induce CYP3A4 .
If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 modulators cannot be avoided , closely monitor for adverse drug reactions .
7 . 2 Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome CYP2B6 Substrates In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6 .
Thiotepa may increase the exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP2B6 in patients ; however , the clinical relevance of this in vitro interaction is unknown [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
The administration of thiotepa with cyclophosphamide in patients reduces the conversion of cyclophosphamide to the active metabolite , 4 - hydroxycyclophosphamide ; the effect appears sequence dependent with a greater reduction in the conversion to 4 - hydroxycyclophosphamide when thiotepa is administered 1 . 5 hours prior to the intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide compared to administration of thiotepa after intravenous cyclophosphamide [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
The reduction in 4 - hydroxycyclophosphamide levels may potentially reduce efficacy of cyclophosphamide treatment .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Breastfeeding is not recommended .
( 8 . 2 ) • Moderate or severerenal impairment : Monitorpatients more frequently for toxicity .
( 8 . 6 , 12 . 2 ) • Moderate or severe hepatic impairment : Monitor patients more frequently for toxicity .

However , due to Adienne SA ' s marketing exclusivity rights , the drug product is not labeled with that information .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings from animals and the drug ’ s mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Limited available data with thiotepa use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of thiotepa to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis produced teratogenic effects ( neural tube defects and malformations of the skeletal system of the fetus ) at doses approximately 0 . 125 and 1 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis .
Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body - surface area [ see Data ] .
Consider the benefits and risks of thiotepa for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing thiotepa to a pregnant woman .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Thiotepa given by the IP route in mice at doses ≥ 1 mg / kg ( 3 . 2 mg / m2 ) , approximately 8 - fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body - surface area , and in rats at doses ≥ 3 mg / kg ( 21 mg / m2 ) , approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body - surface area , resulted in various malformations including neural tube defects , omphalocele , renal agenesis , atresia ani , limb and digit defects , cleft palate , micrognathia , other skeletal anomalies in the skull , vertebrae and ribs , and reduced skeletal ossification .
Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg / kg ( 41 mg / m2 ) , approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body - surface area .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of thiotepa in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions , including the potential for tumorigenicity shown for thiotepa in animal studies , advise patients not to breastfeed during thiotepa treatment .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy testing Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female .
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating thiotepa therapy .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during thiotepa treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of thiotepa .
Advise females to immediately report pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Males Thiotepa may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue , resulting in possible genetic abnormalities .
Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during thiotepa treatment and for at least 1 year after the final dose of thiotepa [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Based on nonclinical findings , male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with thiotepa .
Inform male patients about the possibility of sperm conservation before the start of therapy [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa in neonates have not been established .
Safety and effectiveness of thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast , adenocarcinoma of the ovary , malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder in pediatric patients have not been established .
Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA ’ s TEPADINA ( thiotepa ) for Injection .
However , due to Adienne SA ’ s marketing exclusivity rights , the drug product is not labeled with that information .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast , adenocarcinoma of the ovary , malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreasing hepatic , renal or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment In patients with moderate ( creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) of 30 mL / min to 59 mL / min ) renal impairment , decreased renal excretion may result in increased plasma levels of thiotepa and TEPA [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
This may result in increased toxicity .
Monitor patients with moderate to severe ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment for signs and symptoms of toxicity following treatment with thiotepa for an extended period of time .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Thiotepa is extensively metabolized in the liver .
Patients with moderate ( bilirubin levels greater than 1 . 5 times to 3 times the upper limit of normal and any AST ) hepatic impairment may have increased plasma levels of thiotepa [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
This may result in toxicity .
Monitor patients with moderate to severe ( bilirubin levels greater than 3 times upper limit of normal and any AST ) hepatic impairment for signs and symptoms of toxicity following treatment with thiotepa for an extended period of time .
10 OVERDOSE There is no experience with overdoses of thiotepa .
The most important adverse reactions expected in case of overdose are myeloablation and pancytopenia [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
There is no known antidote for thiotepa .
Monitor the hematological status closely and provide vigorous supportive measures as medically indicated .
11 DESCRIPTION Thiotepa is an alkylating agent .
Thiotepa for injection , USP is supplied as a non - pyrogenic , sterile lyophilized white powder for intravenous , intracavitary , or intravesical use after reconstitution and dilution .
Thiotepa for injection , USP is available in a single - dose vial containing : • 15 mg thiotepa .
After reconstitution with 1 . 5 ml of water for injection , each ml contains 10 mg thiotepa .
• 100 mg thiotepa .
After reconstitution with 10 ml of water for injection , each ml contains 10 mg thiotepa .
Thiotepa is a synthetic product with antitumor activity .
The chemical name for thiotepa is Tris ( 1 - aziridinyl ) phosphine sulfide .
Thiotepa has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Thiotepa , USP has the molecular formula C6H12N3PS , and a molecular weight of 189 . 23 , and it appears as fine , white crystalline flakes , with a melting range of 52 ° C to 57 ° C .
It is soluble in water and organic solvents .
When reconstituted with sterile water for injection , the resulting solution has a pH of approximately 5 . 5 to 7 . 5 .
Thiotepa is unstable in acid medium .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type , related chemically and pharmacologically to the nitrogen mustard .
The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethyleneimine radicals which , like irradiation , disrupt the bonds of DNA .
One of the principle bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N - 7 position , which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines .
12 . 2 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Thiotepa reached maximal concentrations close to the end infusion following an intravenous infusion .
Distribution The binding of thiotepa to plasma proteins is approximately 10 % to 20 % .
In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg / m2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours , the mean volume of distribution of thiotepa ranged from 1 . 0 L / kg ( 30 % ) to 1 . 9 L / kg ( 17 % ) .
Elimination In adults administered intravenous thiotepa between 20 mg to 250 mg / m2 as an intravenous bolus or infusion up to 4 hours , the mean thiotepa clearance ranged from 14 . 6 L / hr / m2 ( 23 % ) to 27 . 9 L / hr / m2 ( 69 % ) .
In adult population , the mean terminal elimination half - life ranged from 1 . 4 hours ( 7 % ) to 3 . 7 hours ( 14 % ) for thiotepa and from 4 . 9 hours to 17 . 6 hours ( 20 % ) for TEPA .
Metabolism Thiotepa undergoes hepatic metabolism .
In vitro data suggests that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 may be responsible for the metabolism of thiotepa to TEPA , a major active metabolite .
Excretion In adult patients , urinary excretion of thiotepa accounted for less than 2 % of the dose and TEPA accounted for 11 % or less of the dose .
Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment The exposure ( as measured by area under the curve ( AUC ) ) of thiotepa increased by 1 . 6 - fold and 1 . 8 - fold following administration of multiple thiotepa doses of 7 mg / kg administered every 2 days with cyclophosphamide in two adult patients who had liver metastases with moderate hepatic impairment compared to the exposure observed in one patient with normal hepatic function .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment on thiotepa exposure is unknown .
Renal Impairment The exposure ( as measured by AUC ) of thiotepa increased by 1 . 4 - fold and TEPA increased by 2 . 6 - fold following administration of multiple doses of 120 mg / m2 / day in one patient with moderate renal impairment ( CLcr = 38 mL / min ) administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin , compared to exposure of thiotepa in patients with normal renal function .
The effects of severe renal impairment or end - stage renal disease on thiotepa exposure are unknown .
Drug Interactions The clinical relevance of in vitro inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzymes described below is unknown , but it cannot be excluded that the systemic exposure of thiotepa or medicinal products that are substrates for these enzymes may be affected with concomitant administration with thiotepa .
Effect of Cytochrome P450 Modulators on Thiotepa In vitro data demonstrates that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inhibitors decrease the metabolism of thiotepa [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome P450 2B6 In vitro data demonstrates that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6 .
Effect of Thiotepa on Cyclophosphamide The administration of thiotepa 1 . 5 hours prior to intravenous cyclophosphamide in patients administered cyclophosphamide plus thiotepa plus carboplatin decreased the AUC of 4 - hydroxycyclophosphamide by 26 % and maximal concentrations of 4 hydroxycyclophosphamide by 62 % , compared to administration of cyclophosphamide prior to thiotepa .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In mice , repeated intraperitoneal ( IP ) administration of thiotepa ( 1 . 15 or 2 . 3 mg / kg three times per week for 52 or 43 weeks , respectively ) produced a significant increase in the combined incidence of squamous - cell carcinomas of the skin , preputial gland , and ear canal , and combined incidence of lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia .
In other studies in mice , repeated IP administration of thiotepa ( 4 or 8 mg / kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 20 week observation period or 1 . 8 mg / kg three times per week for 4 weeks followed by a 35 week observation period ) resulted in an increased incidence of lung tumors .
In rats , repeated IP administration of thiotepa ( 0 . 7 or 1 . 4 mg / kg three times per week for 52 or 34 weeks , respectively ) produced significant increases in the incidence of squamous - cell carcinomas of the skin or ear canal , combined hematopoietic neoplasms , and uterine adenocarcinomas .
Thiotepa given intravenously ( IV ) to rats ( 1 mg / kg once per week for 52 weeks ) produced an increased incidence of malignant tumors ( abdominal cavity sarcoma , lymphosarcoma myelosis , seminoma , fibrosarcoma , salivary gland hemangioendothelioma , mammary sarcoma , pheochromocytoma ) and benign tumors . The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in mice ( 1 . 15 mg / kg , 3 . 68 mg / m2 ) is approximately 7 - fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body - surface area .
The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats ( 0 . 7 mg / kg , 4 . 9 mg / m2 ) is approximately 6 - fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body - surface area .
Thiotepa was mutagenic in in vitro assays in Salmonella typhimurium , E coli , Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes .
Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed in vitro with thiotepa in bean root tips , human lymphocytes , Chinese hamster lung , and monkey lymphocytes .
Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses > 2 . 5 mg / kg ( 8 mg / m2 ) .
The mouse micronucleus test was positive with intraperitoneal administration of > 1 mg / kg ( 3 . 2 mg / m2 ) .
Other positive in vivo chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included Drosophila melanogaster , Chinese hamster marrow , murine marrow , monkey lymphocyte , and murine germ cell .
Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at oral or intraperitoneal doses ≥ 0 . 7 mg / kg ( 2 . 24 mg / m2 ) , approximately 12 - fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body - surface area .
Thiotepa ( 0 . 5 mg ) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity .
Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses ≥ 0 . 5 mg / kg ( 1 . 6 mg / m2 ) , approximately 17 - fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body - surface area .
Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in hamsters at an IP dose of 1 mg / kg ( 4 . 1 mg / m2 ) , approximately 7 - fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body - surface area .
