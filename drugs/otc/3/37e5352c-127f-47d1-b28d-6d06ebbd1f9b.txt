8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Severe Hepatic Impairment : Not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited human data on use of KORSUVA in pregnant women are not sufficient to evaluate a drug - associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage .
In animal reproduction studies , intravenous injection of difelikefalin to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses 711 and 10 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) , respectively , resulted in no adverse effects in either rats or rabbits ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In an embryofetal development study , difelikefalin was administered by intravenous injection to pregnant rats at doses of 0 . 25 , 2 . 5 , and 25 mg / kg / day during the period of organogenesis .
Difelikefalin was not associated with embryofetal lethality or fetal malformations .
Difelikefalin increased the incidences of skeletal variations ( wavy ribs and incompletely ossified ribs ) at the dose of 25 mg / kg / day ( 711 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison ) .
In an embryofetal development study , difelikefalin was administered by intravenous injection to pregnant rabbits at doses of 0 . 025 , 0 . 05 , and 0 . 1 mg / kg / day during the period of organogenesis .
Maternal toxicity evidenced by decreased maternal body weight gain was noted in all dose groups .
Difelikefalin was not associated with embryofetal lethality or fetal malformations at doses up to 0 . 1 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison ) .
In a prenatal and postnatal development study , difelikefalin was administered by intravenous injection to pregnant rats at doses of 0 . 6 , 2 . 5 , and 10 mg / kg / day beginning on gestation day 7 and continuing through lactation day 20 .
Persisting effects on decreased maternal body weight and / or maternal body weight gain as well as food consumption were noted at doses greater than or equal to 2 . 5 mg / kg / day ( 68 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison ) .
No maternal effects were observed at 0 . 6 mg / kg / day ( 14 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison ) .
No difelikefalin - related effects on postnatal developmental , neurobehavioral , or reproductive performance of offspring were noted at doses up to 10 mg / kg / day ( 282 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data regarding the presence of KORSUVA in human milk or effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
Studies in rats showed difelikefalin was transferred into the milk in lactating rats .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for KORSUVA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from KORSUVA or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data Animal Data Difelikefalin was administered to lactating rats by intravenous injection at doses of 0 . 6 , 2 . 5 , or 10 mg / kg / day from gestation day 7 through lactation day 14 .
Difelikefalin was detected in the milk of the lactating rats with the concentration ratio for milk : plasma of 0 . 04 to 0 . 05 across the doses .
There was no measurable difelikefalin in the plasma of nursing pups .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of KORSUVA in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 848 subjects in the placebo - controlled studies who received KORSUVA , 278 subjects ( 32 . 8 % ) were 65 years of age and older and 98 subjects ( 11 . 6 % ) were 75 years of age and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of KORSUVA have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult subjects , with the exception of the incidence of somnolence which was higher in KORSUVA - treated subjects 65 years of age and older ( 7 . 0 % ) than in KORSUVA - treated subjects less than 65 years of age ( 2 . 8 % ) , and was comparable in both placebo age groups ( 3 . 0 % and 2 . 1 % , respectively ) .
No differences in plasma concentrations of KORSUVA were observed between subjects 65 years of age and older and younger adult subjects [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment The influence of mild - to - moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of KORSUVA was evaluated in a population pharmacokinetic analysis which concluded that no KORSUVA dosage adjustments are needed in these populations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of KORSUVA in subjects undergoing HD has not been evaluated ; therefore , use of KORSUVA in this population is not recommended .
10 OVERDOSAGE Single doses of KORSUVA up to 12 times and multiple doses of KORSUVA up to 5 times the recommended dosage of 0 . 5 mcg / kg were administered in clinical studies in subjects undergoing HD .
A dose - dependent increase in adverse reactions , including dizziness , somnolence , mental status changes , paresthesia , fatigue , hypertension , and vomiting , were observed .
In the event of overdosage , provide the appropriate medical attention based on patient ’ s clinical status .
Difelikefalin is primarily eliminated by the kidneys with a low plasma protein binding of approximately 23 % to 28 % in dialysis patients .
Hemodialysis for 4 hours using a high - flux dialyzer effectively cleared approximately 70 % to 80 % of difelikefalin from plasma , and difelikefalin was not detectable in plasma at the end of the second of two dialysis cycles .
[ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of KORSUVA was evaluated in two randomized , multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials ( Trial 1 [ NCT03422653 ] and Trial 2 [ NCT03636269 ] ) that enrolled a total of 851 subjects 18 years of age and older undergoing HD who had moderate - to - severe pruritus .
In both trials , subjects received intravenous bolus injections of KORSUVA 0 . 5 mcg per kilogram of dry body weight into the venous line of the hemodialysis circuit at the end of each hemodialysis session or placebo three times per week for 12 weeks .
In both trials , a 7 - day run - in period prior to randomization was used to confirm that each subject had moderate - to - severe pruritus and to establish a baseline itch intensity , as measured by the patient - reported daily 24 - hour Worst Itching Intensity Numerical Rating Scale ( WI - NRS ) scores ( 0 “ no itch ” to 10 “ worst itch imaginable ” ) .
The mean ( SD ) baseline WI - NRS score was 7 . 1 ( 1 . 5 ) in Trial 1 and 7 . 2 ( 1 . 4 ) in Trial 2 .
At baseline in Trial 1 , 61 % of subjects were male , 49 % were White , 42 % were Black or African American , the mean age was 57 years ( range 22 to 88 years ) , and 40 % of subjects were using prior anti - pruritic medications ( including sedating antihistamines ) and continued the use throughout the trial .
At baseline in Trial 2 , 58 % of subjects were male , 70 % were White , 19 % were Black or African American , the mean age was 60 years ( range 23 to 90 years ) , and 36 % of subjects were using prior anti - pruritic medications ( including sedating antihistamines ) and continued the use throughout the trial .
In each trial , efficacy was assessed based on the proportion of subjects achieving a 4 - point or greater improvement ( reduction ) from baseline in the weekly mean of the daily 24 - hour WI - NRS score at Week 12 .
The results of the KORSUVA trials ( Trials 1 and 2 ) are presented in Table 3 and Figure 1 .
