2 . 6 CardioGen - 82 Infusion System Model 510 Eluate Testing Protocol Use only additive - free 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP for all elutions [ see Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Observe aseptic technique throughout .
Follow all instructions in the CardioGen - 82 Infusion System Model 510 Operator ’ s Manual for performing all eluate testing as described .
Before administering rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection to the first patient each day , perform the following testing : Strontium Alert Limits and Mandatory Eluate Testing : • Use an ionization chamber - type dose calibrator for eluate testing .
• Daily , before administering rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection to any patient , perform an eluate testing to determine Rb 82 , Sr 82 , and Sr 85 levels • Perform additional daily eluate tests after detecting any of the following Alert Limits : • 14 L total elution volume has passed through the generator column , or • Sr 82 level reaches 0 . 002 µCi per mCi Rb 82 , or • Sr 85 level reaches 0 . 02 µCi per mCi Rb 82 .
Perform the additional daily eluate tests at time points determined by the day ’ s elution volume ; tests are performed every 750 mL .
• For example , if an Alert Limit were reached and the clinical site eluted less than 750 mL from the generator during the day , then no additional eluate tests would have been performed that day .
• If the same clinical site the next day eluted 1 , 500 mL from the generator , then the site would have performed three tests that day : 1 ) the required daily test that precedes any patient dosing , 2 ) a test at the 750 mL elution point , and 3 ) a test at the 1 , 500 mL elution points .
• If a generator ’ s Alert Limit is reached , the clinical site performs the additional daily tests ( at intervals of 750 mL ) each subsequent day the generator is used .
The additional tests are necessary to promptly detect excessive Sr 82 and / or Sr 85 in eluates .
Rubidium Eluate Level Testing : • Set a dose calibrator for Rb 82 as recommended by the manufacturer or use the Co - 60 setting and divide the reading obtained by 0 . 548 .
Obtain the reading from the instrument in millicuries .
• Elute the generator with 50 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection USP and discard the eluate ( first elution ) .
• Allow at least 10 minutes for the regeneration of Rb 82 , then elute the generator with 50 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection USP at a rate of 50 mL / min and collect the eluate in a stoppered glass vial ( plastic containers are not suitable ) .
Note the exact time of end of elution ( E . O . E . ) .
• Using the dose calibrator , determine the activity of Rb 82 and note the time of the reading .
Correct the reading for decay to the E . O . E . using the appropriate decay factor for Rb 82 ( see Table 1 ) .
Note : If the reading is taken 2 ½ minutes after end of elution , multiply the dose calibrator reading by 4 to correct for decay .
Strontium Eluate Level Testing : • Using the sample obtained for the Rb 82 activity determination , allow the sample to stand for at least one hour to allow for the complete decay of Rb 82 .
• Measure the activity of the sample in a dose calibrator at the setting recommended by the manufacturer for Rb 82 and / or Sr 82 .
As an alternative , use the Co - 60 setting and the reading obtained divided by 0 . 548 .
Set the instrument to read in microcuries and record in the display .
• Calculate the ratio ( R ) of Sr 85 / Sr 82 on the day ( postcalibration ) of the measurement using the ratio of Sr 85 / Sr 82 on the day of calibration provided on the generator label and the Sr 85 / Sr 82 Ratio Factor from Table 2 .
Determine R using the following equation : R = [ Sr 85 ] / [ Sr 82 ] on calibration date X Ratio Factor on the day ( post - calibration ) of measurement • Use a correction factor ( F ) of 0 . 478 to compensate for the contribution of Sr 85 to the reading .
• Calculate the amount of Sr 82 in the sample using the following equation : Sr 82 ( μCi ) = dose calibration reading ( μCi ) / [ 1 + ( R ) ( F ) ] Example : dose calibrator reading ( µCi ) = 0 . 8 ; Sr85 / Sr82 ratio ( R ) = 1 . 48 ; correction factor ( F ) = 0 . 478 .
Sr 82 ( μCi ) = 0 . 8 / [ 1 + ( 1 . 48 ) ( 0 . 478 ) ] = 0 . 47 • Determine if Sr 82 in the eluate exceeds an Alert or Expiration Limit by dividing the µCi of Sr 82 by the mCi of Rb 82 at End of Elution ( see below for further instructions based on the Sr 82 level ) Example : 0 . 47 µCi or Sr 82 ; 50 mCi of Rb 82 E . O . E . 0 . 47 μCi Sr 82 / 50 mCi Rb 82 = 0 . 0094 μCi / mCi Rb 82 ( is above Alert Limit of 0 . 002 ; additional daily eluate testing must be performed ) • Determine if Sr 85 in the eluate exceeds an Alert or Expiration Limit by multiplying the result obtained in step 10 by ( R ) as calculated in step 7 ( above ) .
Example : 0 . 0094 x 1 . 48 = 0 . 014 µCi Sr 85 / mCi Rb 82 ( test result is below Alert and Expiration Limits ) Use Table 1 to calculate the decay factor for Rb 82 ; step 4 ( above ) .

Immediately stop the patient infusion and permanently discontinue the use of the affected CardioGen - 82 generator whenever the incorrect eluent is used [ see Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] CardioGen - 82 is contraindicated if a solution other than additive free 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP has been used to elute the generator at any time .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Pharmacologic induction of cardiovascular stress : May cause serious adverse reactions such as myocardial infarction , arrhythmia , hypotension , broncho - constriction , and cerebrovascular events .
Perform testing only in setting where cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff are readily available .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 High Level Radiation Exposure with Use of Incorrect Eluent Use only additive free 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP to elute the generator .
Apply the provided saline tag to the additive free 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP container before use .
Additives present in other solutions ( particularly calcium ions ) expose patients to high levels of radiation by causing the release of large amounts of Sr 82 and Sr 85 into the eluate regardless of the generator ’ s age or prior use [ Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 5 , and 2 . 6 , 2 . 7 ) ] .
Immediately stop the patient infusion and discontinue use of the affected CardioGen - 82 generator if the incorrect eluent is used and evaluate the patient ’ s radiation absorbed dose and monitor for the effects of radiation to critical organs such as bone marrow .
When solutions containing calcium ions are used to elute the generator , high levels of radioactivity are present in any subsequent eluate , even with the use of additive free 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP .
[ see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 10 ) and Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 2 Excess Radiation Exposure with Failure to Follow Eluate Testing Protocol Excess radiation exposure occurs when the Sr 82 and Sr 85 levels in rubidium Rb 82 chloride injections exceed the specified generator eluate limits .
Strictly adhere to the eluate testing protocol to minimize radiation exposure to the patient .
Stop using the rubidium generator when the expiration limits are reached [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 , 2 . 7 ) and ( 2 . 8 ) ] .
5 . 3 Risk Associated with Pharmacologic Stress Pharmacologic induction of cardiovascular stress may be associated with serious adverse reactions such as myocardial infarction , arrhythmia , hypotension , bronchoconstriction , and cerebrovascular events .
Perform pharmacologic stress testing in accordance with the pharmacologic stress agent ’ s prescribing information and only in the setting where cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff are readily available .
5 . 4 Volume Overload Patients with congestive heart failure or the elderly may experience a transitory increase in circulatory volume load .
5 . 5 Cumulative Radiation Exposure : Long - Term Risk of Cancer Rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection , similar to other radiopharmaceuticals , contributes to a patient ’ s overall long - term cumulative radiation exposure .
Long - term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer .
Use the lowest dose of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection necessary for imaging and ensure safe handling to protect the patient and health care worker [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Encourage patients to void as soon as a study is completed and as often as possible thereafter for a least one hour .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Bracco Diagnostics Inc at 1 - 800 - 257 - 5181 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch ( 6 ) 6 . 1 Post marketing Experience The following serious adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of CardioGen - 82 .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Radiation Exposure High level radiation exposure to the bone marrow has occurred in some patients due to Sr 82 and Sr 85 breakthrough in the eluate when an incorrect solution was used to elute the rubidium Rb 82 generator [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Excess radiation exposure has occurred in some patients who received rubidium Rb 82 chloride injections at clinical sites where generator eluate testing appeared insufficient [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , and Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 or 2 . 7 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Do not resume breastfeeding until at least one hour after completion of Cardiogen - 82 infusion .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no data available on the use of rubidium Rb 82 chloride in pregnant women .
Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection .
However , all radiopharmaceuticals have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose .
If considering rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection administration to a pregnant woman , inform the patient about the potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes based on the radiation dose from rubidium Rb 82 and the gestational timing of exposure .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of Rb 82 chloride in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Due to the short half - life of rubidium Rb 82 ( 75 seconds ) , exposure of a breastfed infant through breast milk can be minimized by temporary discontinuation of breastfeeding [ See Clinical Considerations ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Rb 82 chloride injection , any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Rb 82 or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Minimizing Exposure Exposure to Rb 82 chloride through breast milk can be minimized if breastfeeding is discontinued when Rb 82 chloride injection is administered .
Do not resume breastfeeding until at least one hour after completion of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection infusion .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In elderly patients with a clinically important decrease in cardiac function , lengthen the delay between infusion and image acquisition [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Observe for the possibility of fluid overload [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Reductions in renal function are not anticipated to alter clearance of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection because Rb 82 decays to stable Kr - 82 with a half - life of 75 seconds and Kr - 82 is exhaled through the lungs .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Reductions in hepatic function are not anticipated to alter clearance of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection .
11 DESCRIPTION 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics CardioGen - 82 contains accelerator - produced Sr 82 adsorbed on stannic oxide in a lead - shielded column and provides a means for obtaining sterile nonpyrogenic solutions of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection .
The chemical form of Rb 82 is 82 RbCl .
The amount ( millicuries ) of Rb 82 obtained in each elution will depend on the potency of the generator .
When eluted at a rate of 50 mL / minute , each generator eluate at the end of elution should not contain more than 0 . 02 microcurie of Sr 82 and not more than 0 . 2 microcurie of Sr 85 per millicurie of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection , and not more than 1 microgram of tin per mL of eluate .
11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Rb 82 decays by positron emission and associated gamma emission with a physical half - life of 75 seconds . 4 Table 5 shows the annihilation photons released following positron emission which are useful for detection and imaging studies .
The decay modes of Rb 82 are : 95 . 5 % by positron emission , resulting in the production of annihilation radiation , i . e . , two 511 keV gamma rays ; and 4 . 5 % by electron capture , resulting in the emission of “ prompt ” gamma rays of predominantly 776 . 5 keV .
Both decay modes lead directly to the formation of stable Kr - 82 . 4 TABLE 5 Principal Radiation Emission Data Mean Percent Mean Energy Radiation Per Disintegration ( keV ) Annihilation photons ( 2 ) 191 . 01 511 ( each ) Gamma rays 13 - 15 776 . 5 The specific gamma ray constant for Rb 82 is 6 . 1 R / hour - millicurie at 1 centimeter .
The first half - value layer is 0 . 7 centimeter of lead ( Pb ) .
Table 6 shows a range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of lead . 5 For example , the use of a 7 . 0 centimeter thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1 , 000 .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Rb 82 is analogous to potassium ion ( K + ) in its biochemical behavior and is rapidly extracted by the myocardium proportional to the blood flow .
Rb + participates in the sodium - potassium ( Na + / K + ) ion exchange pumps that are present in cell membranes .
The intracellular uptake of Rb 82 requires maintenance of ionic gradient across cell membranes .
Rb 82 radioactivity is increased in viable myocardium reflecting intracellular retention , while the tracer is cleared rapidly from necrotic or infarcted tissue .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In human studies , myocardial activity was noted within the first minute after peripheral intravenous injection of Rb 82 .
When areas of infarction or ischemia are present in the myocardium , they are visualized within 2 - 7 minutes after injection as photon - deficient , or “ cold ” , areas on the myocardial scan .
In patients with reduced cardiac function , transit of the injected dose from the peripheral infusion site to the myocardium may be delayed [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Blood flow brings Rb 82 to all areas of the body during the first pass of circulation .
Accordingly , visible uptake is also observed in other highly vascularized organs , such as the kidneys , liver , spleen and lungs .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics With a physical half - life of 75 seconds , Rb 82 is very rapidly converted by radioactive decay into a trace amount of stable Kr - 82 gas , which is passively expired by the lungs .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenicity potential , or to determine whether rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection may affect fertility in males or females .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES In a descriptive , prospective , blinded image interpretation study6 of adult patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease , myocardial perfusion deficits in stress and rest PET images obtained with ammonia N 13 ( n = 111 ) or rubidium Rb 82 chloride ( n = 82 ) were compared to changes in stenosis flow reserve ( SFR ) as determined by coronary angiography .
PET perfusion defects at rest and stress for seven cardiac regions ( anterior , apical , anteroseptal , posterolateral , anterolateral , posterolateral , and inferior walls ) were graded on a scale of 0 ( normal ) to 5 ( severe ) .
Values for stenosis flow reserve , defined as flow at maximum coronary vasodilatation relative to rest flow , ranged from 0 ( total occlusion ) to 5 ( normal ) .
With increasing impairment of flow reserve , the subjective PET defect severity increased .
A PET defect score of 2 or higher was positively correlated with flow reserve impairment ( SFR < 3 ) .
A system review of published literature was conducted using pre - defined inclusion / exclusion criteria which resulted in identification of 10 studies evaluating the use of Rb 82 PET myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) for the identification of coronary artery disease as defined by catheter - based angiography .
In these studies , the patient was the unit of analysis and 50 % stenosis was the threshold for clinically significant coronary artery disease ( CAD ) .
Of these 10 studies , 9 studies were included in a meta - analysis for sensitivity ( excluding one study with 100 % sensitivity ) and 7 studies were included in a meta - analysis of specificity ( excluding 3 studies with 100 % specificity ) .
A random effects model yielded overall estimates of sensitivity and specificity of 92 % ( 95 % CI : 89 % to 95 % ) and 81 % ( 95 % CI : 76 % to 86 % ) , respectively .
The use of meta - analysis in establishing performance characteristics is limited , particularly by the possibility of publication bias ( positive results being more likely to be published than negative results ) which is difficult to detect especially when based on a limited number of small studies .
