CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of Bensal HP ® is not known .
While the following animal data are available , their clinical significance is unknown .
It has been demonstrated that Bensal HP ® significantly reduces methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) protected by biofilms in wounds using porcine models .
In addition , Bensal HP ® stimulates re - epithelialization of second - degree burns in porcine models .
CLINICAL STUDIES A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study evaluated the rate of wound re - epithelialization .
Four partial - thickness wounds ( 2 × 2 cm & 0 . 2 mm deep ) were created under local anesthesia on the thighs of 13 normal , healthy , male volunteers with an electrokeratome .
Bensal HP ® substantially increased the rate of re - epithelialization by 63 % over the vehicle alone ( p < 0 . 01 ) and 77 % over untreated control ( p < 0 . 005 ) .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE An external treatment for the inflammation and irritation associated with many common forms of dermatitis , including certain eczematoid conditions .
