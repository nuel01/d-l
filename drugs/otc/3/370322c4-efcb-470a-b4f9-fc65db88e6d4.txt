3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS ALBUMINEX 25 % is a sterile , aqueous solution of human albumin ( 25 % w / v i . e . 25 g / dL ) for intravenous administration available as : • 50 mL ( 12 . 5 g ) single dose vial • 100 mL ( 25 g ) single dose vial ALBUMINEX 25 % is a solution for infusion : • ALBUMINEX 25 % contains 25 g per dL of human albumin 50 mL ( 12 . 5 g ) and 100 mL ( 25 g ) glass vials 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ALBUMINEX 25 % is contraindicated in patients with : • Hypersensitivity to human albumin or any of the excipients • Severe anemia or cardiac failure with normal or increased intravascular volume • Hypersensitivity to human albumin or the excipients • Severe anemia or cardiac failure with normal or increased intravascular volume 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Suspicion of allergic or anaphylactic reactions requires immediate discontinuation of the injection and implementation of appropriate medical treatment .
( 5 . 1 ) • Hypervolemia may occur if the dosage and rate of infusion are not adjusted to the patient ' s volume status .
Use with caution in conditions where hypervolemia and its consequences or hemodilution could represent a special risk to the patient .
( 5 . 2 ) • When concentrated albumin is administered , care must be taken to assure adequate hydration of the patient .
( 5 . 3 ) • Assessment of electrolytes , coagulation and hematology parameters , and hemodynamic status when albumin is administered .
( 5 . 4 ) • Do not dilute with sterile water for injection .
( 5 . 5 ) • This product is made from human plasma and may contain infectious agents , e . g . viruses and , theoretically , the Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease agent .
( 5 . 6 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Suspicion of allergic or anaphylactic reactions requires immediate discontinuation of the infusion and implementation of appropriate medical treatment .
5 . 2 Hypervolemia Hypervolemia may occur if the dosage and rate of infusion are not adjusted to the patient ' s volume status .
At the first clinical signs of cardiovascular overload ( headache , dyspnea , jugular venous distention , increased blood pressure ) , the infusion must be slowed or stopped immediately .
Use albumin with caution in conditions where hypervolemia and its consequences or hemodilution could represent a special risk to the patient .
Examples of such conditions are : • Decompensated heart failure • Hypertension • Esophageal varices • Pulmonary edema • Hemorrhagic diathesis • Severe anemia • Renal and post - renal anuria 5 . 3 Laboratory Parameters 20 % - 25 % human albumin solutions are relatively low in electrolytes compared to 4 % - 5 % human albumin solutions so if comparatively large volumes are to be replaced , care must be taken to ensure adequate substitution of other blood constituents ( coagulation factors , electrolytes , platelets and erythrocytes ) .
5 . 4 Clinical Hemodynamics Parameters Colloid - osmotic effect of human albumin 25 % is approximately five times that of blood plasma .
Therefore , when concentrated albumin is administered , care must be taken to assure adequate hydration of the patient .
Patients should be monitored carefully to guard against circulatory overload and hyperhydration .
Patients with marked dehydration require administration of additional fluids .
The following parameters should be assessed during administration of ALBUMINEX 25 % : • Arterial blood pressure and pulse rate • Central venous pressure • Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure • Urine output • Electrolytes • Hematocrit / hemoglobin 5 . 5 Pre - infusion Preparation ALBUMINEX 25 % must not be diluted with sterile water for injection as this may cause hemolysis in recipients .
The product can be diluted in an isotonic solution ( e . g . , 5 % dextrose in water or 0 . 9 % sodium chloride ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 6 Infectious Diseases Albumin is a derivative of human blood .
Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes , it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases .
A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) is also considered extremely remote .
No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for ALBUMINEX 25 % .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions are rigors , hypotension / decreased BP , tachycardia / increased heart rate , pyrexia , feeling cold ( chills ) , nausea , vomiting , dyspnea / bronchospasm , rash / pruritus .

11 DESCRIPTION ALBUMINEX 25 % is a sterile , ready - for - use , clear , slightly viscous , almost colorless , yellow , amber or slightly green aqueous solution of human albumin for single dose intravenous infusion .
It is prepared from the pooled plasma of US donors in FDA - licensed facilities in the US .
The product also contains 130 - 160 mmol / L of sodium , less than 200 micrograms / L of aluminum and is stabilized with caprylate ( 0 . 08 mmol / g albumin ) and acetyltryptophanate ( 0 . 08 mmol / g albumin ) but does not contain any preservative .
12 . 5 g ( 50 mL ) of ALBUMINEX 25 % is oncotically equivalent to 250 mL plasma .
25 g ( 100 mL ) of ALBUMINEX 25 % is oncotically equivalent to 500 mL plasma .
The vials are closed with a synthetic rubber stopper .
The stopper is not made with natural rubber latex .
The viral risk from human plasma is minimized by the fractionation process and pasteurization of the albumin solution for 10 hours at 60 ° C ( 140 ° F ) in its final container .
These processes are effective for both enveloped and non - enveloped viruses .
There have been no reports of virus transmission with products manufactured using this combination of processes .
Typical reductions of experimental viral loads are shown in Table 1 .

Human Albumin 25 % has a corresponding hyperoncotic effect .
The primary physiological function of albumin results from its contribution to plasma colloid oncotic pressure and transport function .
Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and is a carrier of hormones , enzymes , medicinal products and toxins .
Other physiological functions include antioxidant properties , free radical scavenging , and capillary membrane integrity .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Albumin is distributed throughout the extracellular space and more than 60 % of the body albumin pool is located in the extravascular fluid compartment .
Albumin has a circulating life span of 15 - 20 days , with a turnover of approximately 15 g per day .
The balance between synthesis and breakdown is normally achieved by feedback regulation .
Elimination is predominantly intracellular and due to lysosome proteases .
In healthy subjects , less than 10 % of infused albumin leaves the intravascular compartment during the first 2 hours following infusion .
There is considerable individual variation in the effect of albumin on plasma volume .
In some patients , the plasma volume can remain elevated for several hours .
In critically ill patients , however , albumin can leak out of the vascular space in substantial amounts at an unpredictable rate .
