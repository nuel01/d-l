DESCRIPTION PerioChip ® ( chlorhexidine gluconate ) is a small , orange - brown , rectangular chip ( rounded at one end ) for insertion into periodontal pockets .
Each PerioChip weighs approximately 6 . 9 mg and contains 2 . 5 mg of chlorhexidine gluconate in a biodegradable matrix of hydrolyzed gelatin ( cross - linked with glutaraldehyde ) .
PerioChip also contains glycerin and purified water .
Chlorhexidine gluconate is an antimicrobial agent .
Chemically , it is designated as 1 , 1 ' - hexamethylenebis [ 5 - ( p - chlorophenyl ) biguanide ] di - D - gluconate , and its molecular formula is C22H30Cl2N10 . 2C6H12O7 .
The molecular weight is 897 . 8 .
The structural formula of chlorhexidine gluconate is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Microbiology Chlorhexidine gluconate is active against a broad spectrum of microbes .
The chlorhexidine molecule , due to its positive charge , reacts with the microbial cell surface , destroys the integrity of the cell membrane , penetrates into the cell , precipitates the cytoplasm , and the cell dies .
Studies with PerioChip showed reductions in the numbers of the putative periodontopathic organisms Porphyromonas ( Bacteroides ) gingivalis , Prevotella ( Bacteroides ) intermedia , Bacteroides forsythus , and Campylobacter rectus ( Wolinella recta ) after placement of the chip .
No overgrowth of opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem were noted .
The relationship of the microbial findings to clinical outcome has not been established .
Pharmacokinetics PerioChip releases chlorhexidine in vitro in a biphasic manner , initially releasing approximately 40 % of the chlorhexidine within the first 24 hours and then releasing the remaining chlorhexidine in an almost linear fashion for 7 - 10 days .
This enzymatic release rate assay is an experimental collagenase assay that differs from the Regulatory Specification ' s Agar Release Rate Assay .
This release profile may be explained as an initial burst effect , dependent on diffusion of chlorhexidine from the chip , followed by a further release of chlorhexidine as a result of enzymatic degradation .
In an in vivo study of 18 evaluable adult patients , there were no detectable plasma or urine levels of chlorhexidine following the insertion of 4 PerioChips under clinical conditions .
The concentration of chlorhexidine released from the PerioChip was determined in the gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) of these same subjects .
In these subjects , a highly variable biphasic release profile for chlorhexidine was demonstrated , with GCF levels 4 hours after chip insertion ( mean : 1444 ± 783 μg / mL ) , followed by a second peak at 72 hours ( mean : 1902 ± 1073 μg / mL ) .
In a second study involving the insertion of 1 PerioChip under clinical conditions , the mean GCF level of chlorhexidine peaked at 1088 ± 678 μg / mL at 4 hours .
The mean GCF levels then declined in a highly erratic fashion to levels of 482 ± 447 μg / mL at 72 hours without producing a true second peak .
The results of these studies confirm a high degree of intersubject variability in chlorhexidine release from the PerioChip matrix in vivo that was not seen in vitro .
Due to the nature and clinical use of the PerioChip dosage form , dose proportionality was not and would not be expected to be demonstrated between the two studies .
Clinical Studies In two double - blind , randomized , controlled clinical trials , 447 adult patients with periodontitis were entered who had at least 4 pockets with probing depth of 5 - 8 mm that bled on probing .
Patients studied were in good general health .
Diabetics were excluded from the studies .
PerioChip was not studied in acutely abscessed periodontal pockets .
Patients were free of supragingival calculus prior to baseline .
In these two studies , the effects of scaling and root planing ( SRP ) alone , and SRP followed by PerioChip treatment , were compared .
All patients received full mouth SRP at baseline .
If the pocket depth remained ≥ 5 mm at 3 and / or 6 months after initial treatment , another chip was placed into the pocket .
Teeth treated with PerioChip were found to have significantly reduced probing pocket depth ( PD ) compared with those treated with SRP alone at 9 months after initial treatment , as shown in Table 1 .

The differences in improvement were statistically significant when analyzed on a per patient basis ( p < 0 . 005 ) .
PerioChip treatment maintained probing attachment level ( PAL ) compared with baseline or with SRP alone at 9 months .
The effects of PerioChip on bleeding upon probing have not been established .
In the two studies , there were no significant changes in plaque development or gingivitis .
Smokers and non - smokers were enrolled in these studies ; although non - smokers using PerioChip demonstrated significant improvement in PD , smokers demonstrated a trend towards improvement that did not reach statistical significance .
This finding is consistent with the consensus that smoking is a risk factor in periodontal diseases .

INDICATIONS AND USAGE PerioChip is indicated as an adjunct to scaling and root planing procedures for reduction of pocket depth in patients with adult periodontitis .
PerioChip may be used as a part of a periodontal maintenance program , which includes good oral hygiene and scaling and root planing .
CONTRAINDICATIONS PerioChip should not be used in any patient who has a known sensitivity to chlorhexidine .
WARNINGS Anaphylaxis , as well as serious allergic reactions , have been reported during postmarketing use with dental products containing chlorhexidine .
PRECAUTIONS General The use of PerioChip in an acutely abscessed periodontal pocket has not been studied and therefore is not recommended .
Although rare , infectious events including abscesses and cellulitis , which have been reported after scaling and root planing alone , have also been reported with the adjunctive placement of the PerioChip post scaling and root planing .
Management of patients with periodontal disease should include consideration of potentially contributing medical disorders , such as cancer , diabetes , and immunocompromised status .
Information for Patients Patients should be advised to report any signs of local adverse reactions to their dentists .
Patients who develop allergic symptoms such as skin rash , itch , generalized swelling , breathing difficulties , light headedness , rapid heart rate , upset stomach or diarrhea , should seek medical attention immediately .
Patients should avoid dental floss at the site of PerioChip insertion for 10 days after placement , because flossing might dislodge the chip .
All other oral hygiene may be continued as usual .
No restrictions regarding dietary habits are needed .
Dislodging of the PerioChip is uncommon ; however , patients should be instructed to notify the dentist promptly if the PerioChip dislodges .
Patients should also be advised that , although some mild to moderate sensitivity is normal during the first week after placement of PerioChip , they should notify the dentist promptly if pain , swelling , or other problems occur .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Chlorhexidine gluconate has not been evaluated for carcinogenic potential in connection with the PerioChip .
No evidence that chlorhexidine gluconate has potential to cause genetic toxicity was obtained in a battery of mutagenicity studies , including ( in vitro ) an Ames assay , a chromosome aberration assay in CHO cells , and ( in vivo ) a micronucleus assay conducted in mice .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted in relation to PerioChip , because animal models that would permit use of a clinically relevant route of administration are not available .
Chlorhexidine gluconate did not induce harm to the fetus when administered to rats by gavage at dosages up to 68 . 5 mg / kg / day .
While chlorhexidine is known to be very poorly absorbed from the GI tract , it may be absorbed following placement within a periodontal pocket .
Therefore , it is unclear whether these data are relevant to clinical use of PerioChip .
In clinical studies , placement of four chips within periodontal pockets resulted in plasma concentrations of chlorhexidine that were at or below the limit of detection .
However , it is not known whether PerioChip can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity .
PerioChip should be used in a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use : The safety and effectiveness of PerioChip in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use : Although subjects aged 65 years and over were included in clinical studies of PerioChip , there were not sufficient numbers of these subjects to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
Overall differences in safety or effectiveness have not been identified between the elderly and younger patients .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently observed adverse events in the two pivotal clinical trials were toothache , upper respiratory tract infection , and headache .
Toothache was the only adverse reaction that was significantly higher ( p = 0 . 042 ) in the PerioChip group when compared to placebo .
Most oral pain or sensitivity occurred within the first week of the initial chip placement following SRP procedures , was mild to moderate in nature , and spontaneously resolved within days .
These reactions were observed less frequently with subsequent chip placement at 3 and 6 months .
Table 3 lists adverse events , occurring in ≥ 1 % of 225 patients that received PerioChip , pooled from the two pivotal clinical trials without regard to causality .
Gingival bleeding was the only dental adverse event occurring at a rate of ≤ 1 % in both groups .

Up to 8 chips may be inserted in a single visit .
Treatment is recommended to be administered once every three months in pockets with PD remaining 5 mm or greater .
The periodontal pocket should be isolated and the surrounding area dried prior to chip insertion .
The PerioChip should be grasped using forceps ( such that the rounded end points away from the forceps ) and inserted into the periodontal pocket to its maximum depth .
If necessary , the PerioChip can be further maneuvered into position using the tips of the forceps or a flat instrument .
The PerioChip does not need to be removed since it biodegrades completely .
In the unlikely event of PerioChip dislodgement ( in the two pivotal clinical trials , only 8 chips were reported lost ) , several actions are recommended , depending on the day of PerioChip loss .
If dislodgement occurs 7 days or more after placement , the dentist should consider the subject to have received a full course of treatment .
If dislodgement occurs within 48 hours after placement , a new PerioChip should be inserted .
If dislodgement occurs more than 48 hours after placement , the dentist should not replace the PerioChip , but reevaluate the patient at 3 months and insert a new PerioChip if the pocket depth has not been reduced to less than 5 mm .
