CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY It is well established that fluoridation of water supply ( 1 ppm fluoride ) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries .
Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body .
The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries - resistant crystal , fluorapatite .
The reaction may be expressed by the equation : 1 Ca10 ( PO4 ) 6 ( OH ) 2 + 2 F - CA10 ( PO4 ) 6F2 + 2 OH - ( Hydroxyapatite ) ( Fluorapatite ) Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished : 1 .
Small amounts ( reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids ) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed .
2 .
After enamel has been laid down , fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel .
Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted .
3 .
After eruption , the surface enamel acquires fluoride from water , food , supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Supplementation of the diet with vitamins A , C and D . Multi - Vitamin Fluoride Drops 0 . 25 mg also provide fluoride for caries prophylaxis .
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16 , in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride , receive daily fluoride supplementation .
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that infants and young children 6 months to 3 years of age , in areas where drinking water contains less than 0 . 3 ppm of fluoride , and children 3 - 6 years of age , in areas where the drinking water contains 0 . 3 through 0 . 6 ppm of fluoride , receive 0 . 25 mg of supplemental fluoride daily which is provided in a dose of 1 mL of Multi - Vitamin Fluoride 0 . 25 mg drops .
( see Dosage and Administration ) .
Multi - Vitamin Fluoride 0 . 25 mg drops supply significant amounts of vitamins A , C and D to supplement the diet , and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop .
Thus , in a single easy - to - use preparation , children obtain essential vitamins and fluoride .
WARNINGS As in the case of all medications , keep out of reach of children .
PRECAUTIONS The suggested dose should not be exceeded since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride .
When prescribing vitamin fluoride products : 1 .
Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water .
2 .
Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other medications and swallowed toothpaste .
3 .
Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis .
Multi - Vitamin and Fluoride Drops 0 . 25 mg should be dispensed in the original plastic container , since contact with glass leads to instability and precipitation .
( The amount of sodium fluoride in the 50 mL size is well below the maximum to be dispensed at one time according to recommendations of the American Dental Association . )
Important Considerations When Using Dosage Schedule : • If fluoride level is unknown , drinking water should be tested for fluoride content before supplements are prescribed .
For testing of fluoride content , contact the local or state health department .
• All sources of fluoride should be evaluated with a thorough fluoride history .
• Patient exposure to multiple water sources can make proper prescribing complex .
• Ingestion of higher than recommended levels of fluoride by children has been associated with an increase in mild dental fluorosis in developing , unerupted teeth .
• Fluoride supplements require long - term compliance on a daily basis .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Allergic rash and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION See following chart .
