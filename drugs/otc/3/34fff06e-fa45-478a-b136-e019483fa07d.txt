[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY This anticholinergic preparation blocks the responses of the sphincter muscle of the iris and the accommodative muscle of the ciliary body to cholinergic stimulation , producing pupillary dilation ( mydriasis ) and paralysis of accommodation ( cycloplegia ) .
It acts rapidly , but has a shorter duration than atropine .
Maximal cycloplegia occurs within 25 to 75 minutes after instillation .
Complete recovery of accommodation usually takes 6 to 24 hours .
Complete recovery from mydriasis in some individuals may require several days .
Heavily pigmented irides may require more doses than lightly pigmented irides .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cyclopentolate hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is used to produce mydriasis and cycloplegia .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitive to any component of this preparation .
WARNINGS FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE .
NOT FOR INJECTION .
This preparation may cause Central Nervous System ( CNS ) disturbances .
This is especially true in younger age groups , but may occur at any age , especially with the stronger cyclopentolate hydrochloride solutions .
Infants are especially prone to CNS and cardiopulmonary side effects from cyclopentolate .
To minimize absorption , use only 1 drop of a 1 % cyclopentolate solution per eye , followed by pressure applied over the nasolacrimal sac for two to three minutes .
Observe infants closely for at least 30 minutes following instillation .
Mydriatics may produce a transient elevation of intraocular pressure .
PRECAUTIONS General : The lacrimal sac should be compressed by digital pressure for two to three minutes after instillation to reduce excessive systemic absorption .
Caution should be observed when considering use of this medication in the presence of Down ’ s syndrome .
Information for Patients : Do not touch dropper tip to any surface , as this may contaminate the solution .
A transient burning sensation may occur upon instillation .
Patients should be advised not to drive or engage in other hazardous activities while pupils are dilated .
Patients may experience sensitivity to light and should protect eyes in bright illumination during dilation .
Parents should be warned not to get this preparation in their child ’ s mouth and to wash their own hands and the child ’ s hands following administration .
Feeding intolerance may follow ophthalmic use of this product in infants .
It is recommended that feeding be withheld for four ( 4 ) hours after examination .
Drug Interactions : Cyclopentolate may interfere with the ocular anti - hypertensive action of carbachol , pilocarpine , or ophthalmic cholinesterase inhibitors .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Studies in animals or humans have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of cyclopentolate hydrochloride ophthalmic solution , USP .

Pediatric Use : Use of cyclopentolate has been associated with psychotic reactions and behavioral disturbances in pediatric patients .
Increased susceptibility to cyclopentolate has been reported in infants , young children , and in children with spastic paralysis or brain damage .
These disturbances include ataxia , incoherent speech , restlessness , hallucinations , hyperactivity , seizures , disorientation as to time and place , and failure to recognize people .
Feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis ( in preterm infants ) may follow ophthalmic use of this product in infants .

Non - ocular : Use of cyclopentolate has been associated with psychotic reactions and behavioral disturbances , usually in children , especially with 2 % concentration .
These disturbances include ataxia , incoherent speech , restlessness , hallucinations , hyperactivity , seizures , disorientation as to time and place , and failure to recognize people .
This drug produces reactions similar to those of other anticholinergic drugs , but the CNS manifestations as noted above are more common .
Other toxic manifestations of anticholinergic drugs are skin rash , abdominal distention in infants , necrotizing enterocolitis ( in preterm infants ) , unusual drowsiness , tachycardia , hyperpyrexia , vasodilation , urinary retention , diminished gastrointestinal motility and decreased secretion in salivary and sweat glands , pharynx , bronchi and nasal passages .

OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosage may produce behavioral disturbances , tachycardia , hyperpyrexia , hypertension , elevated intraocular pressure , vasodilation , urinary retention , diminished gastrointestinal motility and decreased secretion in salivary and sweat glands , pharynx , bronchi and nasal passages .
Patients exhibiting signs of overdosage should receive supportive care and monitoring .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adults : Instill one or two drops of 1 % solution in the eye which may be repeated in five to ten minutes if necessary .
Complete recovery usually occurs in 24 hours .
Complete recovery from mydriasis in some individuals may require several days .
Children : Instill one or two drops of 1 % solution in the eye , which may be repeated five to ten minutes later by a second application of 1 % solution if necessary .
Individuals with heavily pigmented irides may require higher strengths .
