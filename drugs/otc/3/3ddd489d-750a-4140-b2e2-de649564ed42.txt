5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Dyskinesia : Monitor patients for dyskinesia or exacerbation of existing dyskinesia ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Hallucinations / Psychotic Behavior : Consider dosage reduction or stopping NOURIANZ if occurs ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Impulse Control / Compulsive Behaviors : Consider dosage reduction or stopping NOURIANZ if occurs ( 5 . 3 ) .
5 . 1 Dyskinesia NOURIANZ in combination with levodopa may cause dyskinesia or exacerbate pre - existing dyskinesia .
In controlled clinical trials ( Studies 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , the incidence of dyskinesia was 15 % for NOURIANZ 20 mg , 17 % for NOURIANZ 40 mg , and 8 % for placebo , in combination with levodopa .
One percent of patients treated with either NOURIANZ 20 mg or 40 mg discontinued treatment because of dyskinesia , compared to 0 % for placebo .
5 . 2 Hallucinations / Psychotic Behavior Because of the potential risk of exacerbating psychosis , patients with a major psychotic disorder should not be treated with NOURIANZ .
Consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if a patient develops hallucinations or psychotic behaviors while taking NOURIANZ .
In controlled clinical trials ( Studies 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , the incidence of hallucinations was 2 % for NOURIANZ 20 mg , 6 % for NOURIANZ 40 mg , and 3 % for placebo .
In patients treated with NOURIANZ 40 mg , 1 % discontinued because of hallucinations , compared to 0 % for placebo and 0 % for patients treated with NOURIANZ 20 mg .
The incidence of " abnormal thinking and behavior " ( paranoid ideation , delusions , confusion , mania , disorientation , aggressive behavior , agitation , or delirium ) reported as an adverse reaction was 1 % for NOURIANZ 20 mg , 2 % for NOURIANZ 40 mg , and 1 % for placebo .
5 . 3 Impulse Control / Compulsive Behaviors Patients treated with NOURIANZ and one or more medication ( s ) for the treatment of Parkinson ' s disease ( including levodopa ) may experience intense urges to gamble , increased sexual urges , intense urges to spend money , binge or compulsive eating , and / or other intense urges , and the inability to control these urges .
In controlled clinical trials ( Studies 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , one patient treated with NOURIANZ 40 mg was reported to have impulse control disorder , compared to no patient on placebo or NOURIANZ 20 mg .
In some postmarketing cases , these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced , or the medication was discontinued .
Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal , it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges , sexual urges , uncontrolled spending , binge or compulsive eating , or other urges while being treated with NOURIANZ .
Consider dose reduction or discontinuation if a patient develops such urges while taking NOURIANZ [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling : • Dyskinesia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Hallucinations / Psychotic Behavior [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Impulse Control / Compulsive Behaviors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( at least 5 % and more frequent than placebo ) were dyskinesia , dizziness , constipation , nausea , hallucination , and insomnia ( 6 . 1 ) .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of NOURIANZ was evaluated in 734 patients with Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) taking a stable dose of levodopa and a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor , with or without other PD medications , in four randomized , multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials 12 weeks in duration ( Studies 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Of the patient population exposed to NOURIANZ , 50 % were male , 32 % White , 67 % Asian , and the mean age was 65 years ( range : 33 to 84 years ) .
Of these patients , 356 received NOURIANZ 20 mg and 378 received NOURIANZ 40 mg .
Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment The incidence of patients discontinuing for any adverse reaction was 5 % for NOURIANZ 20 mg , 6 % for NOURIANZ 40 mg , and 5 % for placebo .
The most frequently reported adverse reaction causing study discontinuation was dyskinesia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Common Adverse Reactions in Pooled Placebo - Controlled Trials Table 1 shows adverse reactions with a frequency of at least 2 % in patients treated with NOURIANZ 20 mg or 40 mg once daily .
The most common adverse reactions in which the frequency for NOURIANZ was at least 5 % , and greater than the incidence on placebo , were dyskinesia , dizziness , constipation , nausea , hallucination , and insomnia .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions with an Incidence of at Least 2 % in Patients Treated with NOURIANZ , and Greater than on Placebo , in Pooled Studies 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 Adverse Reactions NOURIANZ 20 mg / day ( N = 356 ) % NOURIANZ 40 mg / day ( N = 378 ) % Placebo N = 426 ( % ) Nervous system disorders Dyskinesia 15 17 8 Dizziness 3 6 4 Gastrointestinal disorders Constipation 5 6 3 Nausea 4 6 5 Diarrhea 1 2 1 Psychiatric disorders Hallucination [ 1 ] 2 6 3 Insomnia 1 6 4 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Decreased appetite 1 3 1 Investigations Blood alkaline phosphatase increased 1 2 1 Blood glucose increased 1 2 0 Blood urea increased 1 2 0 Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders Upper Respiratory Tract Inflammation 1 2 0 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash 1 2 1 [ 1 ] Includes hallucinations , hallucinations visual , hallucinations olfactory , hallucinations somatic , hallucinations auditory .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post approval use of istradefylline outside of the United States .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure : increased libido .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors : Recommended maximum dosage with concomitant use is 20 mg once daily ( 2 . 2 , 7 . 1 ) .
• Strong CYP 3A4 inducers : Avoid use ( 2 . 3 , 7 . 1 ) .
7 . 1 Effect of Other Drugs on NOURIANZ Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of NOURIANZ with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ( ketoconazole ) increased istradefylline AUCinf by 2 . 5 - fold [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Therefore , the recommended maximum dosage of NOURIANZ in patients concomitantly using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , itraconazole , ketoconazole , clarithromycin ) is 20 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of NOURIANZ with a strong CYP3A4 inducer ( rifampin ) decreased istradefylline Cmax and AUCinf by 45 % and 81 % , respectively [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Therefore , it is recommended to avoid use of NOURIANZ with strong CYP3A4 inducers ( e . g . , carbamazepine , rifampin , phenytoin , St . John ' s wort ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Effect of NOURIANZ on Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Coadministration of NOURIANZ 20 mg with a CYP3A4 substrate ( midazolam ) did not affect the CYP3A4 substrate exposure , while concomitant administration of NOURIANZ 40 mg increased the CYP3A4 substrate ( atorvastatin ) Cmax and AUCinf by 1 . 5 - fold [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Monitor for an increase in adverse reactions of concomitant drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates when coadministering with NOURIANZ 40 mg .
P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) Substrates Coadministration of NOURIANZ with a P - gp substrate ( digoxin ) increased the P - gp substrate Cmax and AUCinf by 33 % and 21 % , respectively [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Monitor for an increase in adverse reactions of concomitant drugs that are P - gp substrates when coadministering with NOURIANZ .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm ( 8 . 1 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of NOURIANZ in pregnant women .
In animal studies ( see Data ) , oral administration of istradefylline during pregnancy resulted in teratogenicity ( increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities , embryofetal and offspring mortality and growth deficits ) at clinically relevant exposures and in the absence of maternal toxicity .
The teratogenic effects of istradefylline in pregnant rabbits were substantially greater when administered in combination with levodopa / carbidopa than when administered alone .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Oral administration of istradefylline ( 0 , 40 , 200 , or 1000 mg / kg / day ) to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal skeletal and visceral variations at the highest dose tested .
Plasma exposure ( AUC ) at the no - effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rats ( 200 mg / kg / day ) is approximately 4 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 40 mg .
Oral administration of istradefylline ( 0 , 50 , 200 , or 800 mg / kg / day ) to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in increased embryofetal mortality at the mid and high doses , increased fetal malformations ( external , visceral , skeletal ) at all doses , and reduced fetal body weight at the highest dose tested .
A no - effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits was not identified .
Plasma exposure ( AUC ) at the lowest dose tested ( 50 mg / kg / day ) is less than that in humans at the MRHD .
In pregnant rabbits , oral administration of istradefylline ( 0 , 50 , 200 , or 400 mg / kg / day ) alone or in combination with oral levodopa / carbidopa ( 80 / 20 mg / kg / day ) throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in an increase in embryofetal mortality and an increase ( marked at the high dose ) in malformations ( including limb reduction , craniofacial , and cardiovascular ) in fetuses from rats administered istradefylline at all doses in combination with levodopa / carbidopa .
Istradefylline alone resulted in an increase in embryofetal mortality and visceral malformations ; no increase in fetal malformations was observed with levodopa / carbidopa alone .
Fetal body weight was reduced by istradefylline alone ( 400 mg / kg / day ) and in combination ( 200 and 400 mg / kg / day ) with levodopa / carbidopa .
A no - effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits when istradefylline was administered in combination with levodopa / carbidopa was not identified .
Plasma exposure ( AUC ) at the lowest dose of istradefylline tested ( 50 mg / kg / day ) in combination with levodopa / carbidopa is less than that in humans at the MRHD .
Oral administration of istradefylline ( 0 , 6 , 25 , 100 , or 400 mg / kg / day ) to female rats throughout gestation and lactation resulted in decreased pup survival and reduced pup body weight ( which persisted into adulthood ) at all but the lowest dose tested .
Exposure to drug in the milk may have contributed to these effects , as demonstrated in pups of untreated ( control ) dams reared by dams receiving istradefylline ( 400 mg / kg / day ) .
No adverse effects were observed on physical or neurobehavioral development , or reproductive function .
Plasma exposure at the no - effect dose for adverse effects on pre - and postnatal development in rats ( 6 mg / kg / day ) is less than that in humans at the MRHD .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of istradefylline in human milk , the effects of istradefylline on the breastfed infant , or the effects of istradefylline on milk production .
Istradefylline was present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations up to 10 times that in maternal plasma .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for NOURIANZ , and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from NOURIANZ or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Use of NOURIANZ during pregnancy is not recommended .
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use contraception during treatment with NOURIANZ [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No adjustment of NOURIANZ dosage is recommended on the basis of age .
Of the total number of PD patients who received NOURIANZ in clinical trials , 53 % were ≥ 65 years and 13 % were ≥ 75 years of age .
No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No adjustment of NOURIANZ dosage is needed in patients with mild renal impairment ( estimated creatinine clearance ( CrCL ) by Cockcroft - Gault equation : 60 - 89 mL / min ) , moderate renal impairment ( CrCL 30 - 59 mL / min ) , or severe renal impairment ( CrCL 15 - 29 mL / min ) .
NOURIANZ has not been evaluated in patients with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) ( CrCL < 15 mL / min ) or ESRD requiring hemodialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No adjustment of NOURIANZ dosage is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A ) .
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh B ) , the steady - state exposures ( AUC0 - 24 h ) were predicted to be 3 . 3 - fold higher than in healthy subjects , based on the estimated mean terminal half - life .
Therefore , the maximum recommended dosage of NOURIANZ in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh B ) is 20 mg once daily [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Closely monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for adverse events when on NOURIANZ treatment [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
NOURIANZ has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) .
Avoid use of NOURIANZ in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Tobacco Smokers Tobacco smoking decreased NOURIANZ steady - state systemic exposures by 38 % to 54 % [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may decrease efficacy .
Therefore , the recommended NOURIANZ dosage in patients who smoke 20 or more cigarettes per day ( or the equivalent amount of another tobacco product ) is 40 mg once daily .
10 OVERDOSAGE 10 . 1 Human Experience There is limited clinical experience regarding human overdosage with NOURIANZ .
In clinical trials , one patient took 6 tablets ( 120 mg , 3 times the maximum recommended dosage ) of istradefylline with alcoholic beverages and developed hallucinations , agitation , and worsening dyskinesia .
10 . 2 Management of Overdose There are no known specific antidotes for NOURIANZ nor any specific treatment for istradefylline overdose .
If an overdose occurs , NOURIANZ treatment should be discontinued and supportive treatment should be administered as clinically indicated .
Consider the long terminal half - life of istradefylline ( about 83 hours ) and the possibility of multiple drug involvement .
Consult a Certified Poison Control Center for up - to - date guidance and advice .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which istradefylline exerts its therapeutic effect in Parkinson disease is unknown .
In in vitro studies and in in vivo animal studies , istradefylline was demonstrated to be an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of NOURIANZ ( 40 mg or 160 mg [ 4 times the maximum recommended dosage ] once daily for 14 days ) on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized , placebo and moxifloxacin - controlled , multiple - dose , blinded , parallel group study .
There was no clinically significant prolongation of QTc interval or relationship between changes in QTc and concentrations of istradefylline .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Istradefylline exhibits dose - proportional pharmacokinetics after multiple oral doses from 20 mg to 80 mg ( 2 times the maximum recommended dosage ) .
Steady - state was reached within 2 weeks of once - daily dosing .
The pharmacokinetics of istradefylline were similar in PD patients and healthy subjects .
Absorption The median time to reach the maximum concentration ( Tmax ) for istradefylline was about 4 hours under fasted dosing conditions .
Effect of Food Istradefylline exposure , represented by the area under the curve over time to infinity ( AUCinf ) , increased 1 . 25 - fold when NOURIANZ was coadministered with a standard high - fat meal , compared with administration in a fasted state .
Istradefylline maximum plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) increased by 1 . 64 - fold and Tmax was shortened by 1 hour when NOURIANZ was administered with a high - fat meal .
These differences in pharmacokinetic parameters are not expected to be clinically significant [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Distribution The plasma protein binding of istradefylline was approximately 98 % .
The apparent volume of distribution ( Vd / F ) of istradefylline is approximately 557 liters .
Elimination The total clearance of istradefylline is approximately 4 . 6 L / hour .
The mean terminal half - life ( t1 / 2 ) for istradefylline at steady - state is approximately 83 hours .
Metabolism In humans , istradefylline is exclusively eliminated via metabolism .
In vitro studies indicate that istradefylline is primarily metabolized via CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 , with minor contribution from CYP1A2 , 2B6 , 2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C18 , and 2D6 .
Six metabolites have been identified in human plasma .
These metabolites each account for less than 10 % of the exposure of the parent drug .
Excretion Approximately 48 % of a 40 - mg oral dose of 14 C - istradefylline was eliminated in feces , and 39 % in urine .
Unchanged istradefylline was not detected in urine .
Specific Populations In patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh B ) , the steady - state exposure ( AUC0 - 24 ) of istradefylline is predicted to be 3 . 3 - fold higher relative to healthy subjects , based on the estimated mean terminal half - life [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses , no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of istradefylline were observed based on age , sex , weight , or race .
No clinically relevant changes in istradefylline exposure were observed in patients with severe renal impairment ( CrCL 15 - 29 mL / min ) or mild hepatic impairment .
NOURIANZ has not been studied in patients with ESRD ( CrCL < 15 mL / min ) , ESRD patients requiring hemodialysis , or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) ] .
Steady - state systemic exposure to istradefylline ( 40 mg ) is 38 % to 54 % lower in tobacco smokers ( who smoke 20 or more cigarettes per day ) when compared with non - smokers matched for age , gender , and body weight [ see Specific Populations ( 8 . 8 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Drug - Metabolizing Enzyme Inhibition Istradefylline is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 , but not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , 2B6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , or 2D6 in vitro .
Drug - Metabolizing Enzyme Induction Istradefylline was a weak inducer of CYP3A4 but not an inducer of CYP1A2 and 2B6 when tested in vitro .
However , clinical drug - drug interaction studies with a CYP3A4 substrate ( i . e . , midazolam ) showed no induction of CYP3A4 .
Transporters Istradefylline was not a substrate for drug transporters P - gp , BCRP , OATP1B1 , or OATP1B3 when tested in vitro .
Istradefylline was a weak inhibitor for P - gp , BCRP , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OAT1 , OCT2 , MATE1 , and MATE2 - K , but not an inhibitor of OAT3 when tested in vitro .
In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Istradefylline Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of ketoconazole ( 200 mg twice daily for 4 days ) with a single dose of istradefylline ( 40 mg ) increased the AUCinf of istradefylline by 2 . 5 - fold , but had no effect on Cmax [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of rifampin ( 600 mg daily for 20 days ) with a single dose of istradefylline ( 40 mg ) reduced the Cmax and AUCinf of istradefylline by 45 % and 81 % respectively , when compared with istradefylline administered alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Effect of Istradefylline on Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Coadministration of istradefylline at higher than the recommended doses ( 80 mg for 14 days ) with a single dose of midazolam ( 10 mg ) increased midazolam AUCinf 2 . 4 - fold , and Cmax by 1 . 6 - fold , when compared with midazolam administered alone .
Coadministration of lower doses of istradefylline ( 5 mg and 20 mg ) with midazolam ( 7 . 5 mg ) did not have these effects [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Coadministration of istradefylline ( 40 mg daily for 17 days ) with a single dose of atorvastatin ( 40 mg ) increased the Cmax and AUCinf of atorvastatin by 1 . 5 - fold , compared with atorvastatin alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
P - glycoprotein Substrates Coadministration of istradefylline ( 40 mg daily for 21 days ) with a single dose of digoxin ( 0 . 4 mg ) increased the Cmax and AUCinf of digoxin by 33 % and 21 % , respectively , when compared with digoxin alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Carbidopa / Levodopa Coadministration of istradefylline ( 80 mg [ two times the recommended maximum dosage ] daily for 14 days ) with a single dose of carbidopa / levodopa ( 50 / 200 mg ) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of carbidopa / levodopa .
Also , coadministration of istradefylline ( 20 mg or 40 mg daily for 14 days ) with carbidopa / levodopa ( 25 / 100 mg three times a day for 14 days ) did not affect the systemic exposure of carbidopa / levodopa .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In lifetime oral carcinogenicity studies , there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in mouse ( 0 , 25 , 125 , or 250 mg / kg ) or rat ( 0 , 30 , 100 , or 320 mg / kg ) .
Plasma exposures ( AUC ) at the highest doses tested were approximately 20 ( mouse ) and 10 ( rat ) times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 40 mg / day .
Mutagenesis Istradefylline was negative in in vitro ( bacterial reverse mutation assay , chromosomal aberration in mammalian cells ) and in vivo ( mouse bone marrow micronucleus ) assays .
Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of istradefylline ( 0 , 160 , 360 , or 800 mg / kg / day ) to male and female rats prior to and during mating and continuing in females to gestation day 7 resulted in a decrease in fertility at the highest dose tested and an increase in preimplantation loss at the mid and high doses .
Sperm motility was reduced at the highest dose tested .
Plasma exposure ( AUC ) at the no - effect dose ( 160 mg / kg for adverse effects on reproductive function is approximately 3 times that in humans at the MRHD .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Oral administration of istradefylline ( 0 , 30 , 100 , or 320 mg / kg / day ) to rats for two years resulted in an increase in the incidence and severity of vascular mineralization in the brain ( including in the caudate / putamen , globus pallidus , thalamus , and nucleus accumbens ) at all doses tested .
The vascular mineralization was composed of calcium and phosphorus and , at higher doses , were reported to partially or completely occlude the blood vessels .
There was no evidence of neuronal degeneration , inflammation , or glial response associated with the foci of mineralization .
Brain mineralization was not detected in mice administered istradefylline ( 0 , 25 , 125 , or 250 mg / kg / day ) orally for two years or in dogs administered istradefylline ( 0 , 10 , 30 , or 100 mg / kg / day ) orally for 52 weeks .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of NOURIANZ for the adjunctive treatment to levodopa / carbidopa in patients with Parkinson ' s disease experiencing " off " episodes was shown in four randomized , multicenter , double - blind , 12 - week , placebo - controlled studies ( Study 1 , NCT00456586 ; Study 2 , NCT00199407 ; Study 3 , NCT00455507 ; and Study 4 , NCT00955526 ) .
The studies enrolled patients with a mean duration of Parkinson ' s disease of 9 years ( range : 1 month to 37 years ) that were Hoehn and Yahr Stage II to IV , experiencing at least 2 hours ( mean approximately 6 hours ) of " off " time per day , and were treated with levodopa for at least one year , with stable dosage for at least 4 weeks before screening ( mean total daily dosage range : 416 to 785 mg ) .
Patients continued levodopa treatment with or without concomitant PD medications , including dopamine agonists ( 85 % ) , COMT inhibitors ( 38 % ) , MAO - B inhibitors ( 40 % ) , anticholinergics ( 13 % ) , and / or amantadine ( 33 % ) , provided the medications were stable for at least 4 weeks before screening and throughout the study period .
The studies excluded patients who had received a neurosurgical treatment for PD ( e . g . , pallidotomy , thalamotomy , deep brain stimulation ) .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the daily awake percentage of " off " time , or the change from baseline in total daily " off " time , based on 24 - hour diaries completed by patients .
