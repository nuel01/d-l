Adverse reactions reported include the following : anaphylactoid reaction , application site irritation , facial edema , paroxysmal sneezing , tolerance , urinary retention , and xerophthalmia .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Central Nervous System Depressants Concurrent use of azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because reductions in alertness and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 2 Erythromycin and Ketoconazole Interaction studies investigating the cardiac effects , as measured by the corrected QT interval ( QTc ) , of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted .
Oral erythromycin ( 500 mg three times daily for 7 days ) had no effect on azelastine pharmacokinetics or QTc based on analyses of serial electrocardiograms .
Ketoconazole ( 200 mg twice daily for 7 days ) interfered with the measurement of azelastine plasma concentrations on the analytic HPLC ; however , no effects on QTc were observed [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) and ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Cimetidine Cimetidine ( 400 mg twice daily ) increased the mean Cmax and AUC of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride ( 4 mg twice daily ) by approximately 65 % [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from postmarketing experience over decades of use with azelastine hydrochloride in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage , birth defects , or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 4 times the clinical daily dose .
Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice , rats , and rabbits , during the period of organogenesis , produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities , decreased embryo - fetal survival , and decreased fetal body weights at doses 180 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose ( MRHDID ) of 1 . 644 mg .
However , the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis , azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo - fetal death , structural abnormalities ( cleft palate ; short or absent tail ; fused , absent or branched ribs ) , delayed ossification , and decreased fetal weight at approximately 200 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose ( MRHDID ) in adults ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68 . 6 mg / kg / day ) , which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight .
Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 9 times the MRHDID in adults ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg / kg / day ) .
In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17 , azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities ( oligo - and brachydactylia ) , delayed ossification , and skeletal variations , in the absence of maternal toxicity , at approximately 180 times the MRHDID in adults ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg / kg / day ) .
Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo - fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 410 times the MRHDID ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68 . 6 mg / kg / day ) .
Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 10 times the MRHDID ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg / kg / day ) .
In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18 , azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion , delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 360 times the MRHDID in adults ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg / kg / day ) .
Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 4 times the MRHDID ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0 . 3 mg / kg / day ) .
In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21 , azelastine hydrochloride produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 180 times the MRHDID ( on mg / m2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg / kg / day . )
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine hydrochloride in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production following use of azelastine hydrochloride .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % is administered to a nursing woman .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % have been established for seasonal allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age and perennial allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % in pediatric patients below 6 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine HCl nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine HCl nasal spray .
Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse events , other than increased somnolence , since one 30 - mL bottle of azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % contains up to 45 mg of azelastine hydrochloride .
Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride ( up to 16 mg ) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse events .
General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs .
There is no known antidote to azelastine HCl nasal spray .
Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in children .
Accordingly , azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % should be kept out of the reach of children .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine hydrochloride , a phthalazinone derivative , exhibits histamine H1 - receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues , animal models , and humans .
Azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies .
The major metabolite , desmethylazelastine , also possesses H1 - receptor antagonist activity .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Effects : In a placebo - controlled trial ( 95 patients with allergic rhinitis ) , there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray ( 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days ) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval ( QTc ) of the electrocardiogram .
Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily , the mean change in QTc was 7 . 2 msec and 3 . 6 msec , respectively .
Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted .
Oral erythromycin had no effect on azelastine pharmacokinetics or QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms .
Ketoconazole interfered with the measurement of azelastine plasma levels ; however , no effects on QTc were observed [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : After intranasal administration of 2 sprays per nostril ( 822 mcg total dose ) of azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % , the mean azelastine peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is 409 pg / mL , the mean extent of systemic exposure ( AUC ) is 9312 pg • hr / mL and the median time to reach Cmax ( tmax ) is 4 hours .
The systemic bioavailability of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 40 % after intranasal administration .
Distribution : Based on intravenous and oral administration , the steady - state volume of distribution of azelastine is 14 . 5 L / kg .
In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and its metabolite , desmethylazelastine , are approximately 88 % and 97 % , respectively .
Metabolism : Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite , desmethylazelastine , by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system .
The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified .
After a single - dose , intranasal administration of azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % ( 822 mcg total dose ) , the mean desmethylazelastine Cmax is 38 pg / mL , the AUC is 3824 pg • hr / mL and the median tmax is 24 hours .

Elimination : Following intranasal administration of azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % , the elimination half - life of azelastine is 25 hours while that of desmethylazelastine is 57 hours .
Approximately 75 % of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10 % as unchanged azelastine .
Special Populations : Hepatic Impairment : Following oral administration , pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment .
Renal Impairment : Based on oral , single - dose studies , renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min ) resulted in a 70 - 75 % higher Cmax and AUC compared to healthy subjects .
Time to maximum concentration was unchanged .
Age : Following oral administration , pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age .
Gender : Following oral administration , pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender .
Race : The effect of race has not been evaluated .
Drug - Drug Interactions : Erythromycin : Co - administration of orally administered azelastine ( 4 mg twice daily ) with erythromycin ( 500 mg three times daily for 7 days ) resulted in Cmax of 5 . 36 ± 2 . 6 ng / mL and AUC of 49 . 7 ± 24 ng • h / mL for azelastine , whereas , administration of azelastine alone resulted in Cmax of 5 . 57 ± 2 . 7 ng / mL and AUC of 48 . 4 ± 24 ng • h / mL for azelastine [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Cimetidine and Ranitidine : In a multiple - dose , steady - state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects , cimetidine ( 400 mg twice daily ) increased orally administered mean azelastine ( 4 mg twice daily ) concentrations by approximately 65 % .
Co - administration of orally administered azelastine ( 4 mg twice daily ) with ranitidine hydrochloride ( 150 mg twice daily ) resulted in Cmax of 8 . 89 ± 3 . 28 ng / mL and AUC of 88 . 22 ± 40 . 43 ng • h / mL for azelastine , whereas , administration of azelastine alone resulted in Cmax of 7 . 83 ± 4 . 06 ng / mL and AUC of 80 . 09 ± 43 . 55 ng • h / mL for azelastine [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
