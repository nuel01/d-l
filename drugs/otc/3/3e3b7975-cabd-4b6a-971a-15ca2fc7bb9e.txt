Administer prophylactic antifungal and antibacterial therapy if clinically indicated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Antiviral prophylactic therapy is recommended for patients who are seropositive for cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) at the time of transplant and for CMV - seronegative patients scheduled to receive a kidney from a CMV - seropositive donor [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
2 . 5 Instructions for Dilution and Administration Reconstitution After calculating the number of vials needed , using aseptic technique , reconstitute each vial of THYMOGLOBULIN with 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection , USP ( SWFI ) .
• Allow THYMOGLOBULIN vials to reach room temperature before reconstituting the lyophilized product .
• Aseptically remove caps to expose rubber stoppers .
• Clean stoppers with germicidal or alcohol swab .
• Aseptically reconstitute each vial of THYMOGLOBULIN lyophilized powder with the 5 mL of SWFI .
• Rotate vial gently until powder is completely dissolved .
Each reconstituted vial contains 25 mg or 5 mg / mL of THYMOGLOBULIN .
• Inspect solution for particulate matter after reconstitution .
Should some particulate matter remain , continue to gently rotate the vial until no particulate matter is visible .
If particulate matter persists , discard this vial .
Dilution • Transfer the contents of the calculated number of THYMOGLOBULIN vials into the bag of infusion solution ( saline or dextrose ) .
Recommended volume : per one vial of THYMOGLOBULIN use 50 mL of infusion solution ( total volume usually between 50 to 500 mL ) .
Discard unused portion .
• Mix the solution by inverting the bag gently only once or twice .
Infusion Administer THYMOGLOBULIN under strict medical supervision in a hospital setting , and carefully monitor patients during the infusion .
THYMOGLOBULIN is less likely to produce side effects when administered at the recommended flow rate [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Follow the manufacturer ' s instructions for the infusion administration set .
Infuse through a 0 . 22 micrometer filter into a high - flow vein .
• Set the flow rate to deliver the dose over a minimum of 6 hours for the first dose and over at least 4 hours for subsequent doses .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS THYMOGLOBULIN for injection : 25 mg anti - thymocyte globulin ( rabbit ) as a sterile lyophilized powder , in single - dose 10 mL vials for reconstitution .

( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS THYMOGLOBULIN is contraindicated in patients with history of allergy or anaphylactic reaction to rabbit proteins or to any product excipients , or who have active acute or chronic infections that contraindicate any additional immunosuppression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 5 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Allergy or anaphylactic reaction to rabbit proteins or to any product excipients , or active acute or chronic infections which contraindicate any additional immunosuppression ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • THYMOGLOBULIN should only be used by physicians experienced in immunosuppressant therapy in transplantation .
( 5 . 1 ) • Immune - mediated reactions : THYMOGLOBULIN infusion could result in an anaphylactic reaction .
( 5 . 2 ) • Infusion - associated reactions : Close compliance with the recommended infusion time may reduce the incidence and severity of infusion - associated reactions .
( 5 . 3 ) • Hematologic effects : low counts of platelets and white blood cells have been identified and are reversible following dose adjustments .
Monitor total white blood cell and platelet counts .
( 5 . 4 ) • Infection : Infections and reactivation of infections have been reported .
Monitor patients and administer anti - infective prophylaxis .
( 5 . 5 ) • Malignancy : Incidence of malignancies may increase .
( 5 . 6 ) • Immunization with attenuated live vaccines is not recommended for patients who have recently received THYMOGLOBULIN .
( 5 . 7 ) • THYMOGLOBULIN may interfere with rabbit antibody – based immunoassays and with cross - match or panel - reactive antibody cytotoxicity assays .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Management of Immunosuppression To prevent over - immunosuppression , physicians may wish to decrease the dose of the maintenance immunosuppression regimen during the period of THYMOGLOBULIN use .
Dosing for THYMOGLOBULIN is different from dosing for other anti - thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) products , because protein composition and concentrations vary depending on the source of ATG .
The prescribing physician must ensure that the dose prescribed is appropriate for the ATG product being administered .
5 . 2 Immune - Mediated Reactions Serious immune - mediated reactions , including anaphylaxis or severe cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) , have been reported with the use of THYMOGLOBULIN [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Fatal anaphylaxis has been reported .
If an anaphylactic reaction occurs , terminate the infusion immediately .
Provide emergency treatment , such as 0 . 3 mL to 0 . 5 mL aqueous epinephrine ( 1 : 1000 dilution ) subcutaneously and other resuscitative measures including oxygen , intravenous fluids , antihistamines , corticosteroids , pressor amines , and airway management , as clinically indicated .
5 . 3 Infusion - Associated Reactions Cases consistent with cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) have been reported with rapid infusion rates .
CRS is attributed to the release of cytokines by activated monocytes and lymphocytes .
Severe acute CRS can cause serious cardiorespiratory events and / or death [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Close compliance with the recommended dosage and infusion time may reduce the incidence and severity of infusion - associated reactions ( IARs ) .
Slowing the infusion rate may minimize many of these IARs .
Reactions at the infusion site may include pain , swelling , and redness of the skin .
5 . 4 Hematologic Effects Low counts of platelets and white blood cells ( including low counts of lymphocytes and neutrophils ) have been identified and are reversible following dose adjustments .
Total white blood cell and platelet counts should be monitored [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 5 Infection THYMOGLOBULIN is routinely used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents .
Infections ( bacterial , fungal , viral and protozoal ) , reactivation of infection ( particularly cytomegalovirus [ CMV ] ) and sepsis have been reported after THYMOGLOBULIN administration in combination with multiple immunosuppressive agents .
These infections can be fatal .
Monitor patients carefully and administer appropriate anti - infective treatment when indicated [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 6 Malignancy Use of immunosuppressive agents , including THYMOGLOBULIN , may increase the incidence of malignancies , including lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disorders .
These events have been associated with fatal outcome [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 7 Immunizations The safety of immunization with attenuated live vaccines following THYMOGLOBULIN therapy has not been studied ; therefore , immunization with attenuated live vaccines is not recommended for patients who have recently received THYMOGLOBULIN .
5 . 8 Laboratory Tests THYMOGLOBULIN may interfere with rabbit antibody – based immunoassays and with cross - match or panel - reactive antibody cytotoxicity assays .
THYMOGLOBULIN has not been shown to interfere with any routine clinical laboratory tests that do not use immunoglobulins .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities ( incidence > 5 % higher than comparator ) are urinary tract infection , abdominal pain , hypertension , nausea , shortness of breath , fever , headache , anxiety , chills , increased potassium levels in the blood , and low counts of platelets and white blood cells .
The most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities ( incidence > 5 % higher than comparator ) are urinary tract infection , abdominal pain , hypertension , nausea , shortness of breath , fever , headache , anxiety , chills , increased potassium levels in the blood , low counts of platelets and white blood cells .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of THYMOGLOBULIN .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Infusion - Associated Reactions and Immune System Disorders IARs may occur following the administration of THYMOGLOBULIN and may occur as soon as the first or second infusion during a single course of THYMOGLOBULIN treatment .
Clinical manifestations of IARs have included the following signs and symptoms : fever , chills / rigors , dyspnea , nausea / vomiting , diarrhea , hypotension or hypertension , malaise , rash , urticaria , decreased oxygen saturation , and / or headache .
IARs with THYMOGLOBULIN are generally manageable with a reduction in infusion rates and / or with medications [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Some of these reactions such as arthralgia / myalgia , lymphadenopathy , proteinuria , and decreased oxygen saturation tend to occur 5 to 15 days after THYMOGLOBULIN infusion and are consistent with serum sickness .
Symptoms are manageable with corticosteroid treatment .
Serious and fatal anaphylactic reactions have been reported .
The fatalities occurred in patients who did not receive epinephrine during the event [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
IARs consistent with cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) have been reported .
Severe and potentially life - threatening CRS cases have also been reported .
Postmarketing reports of severe CRS have included cardiorespiratory dysfunction ( including hypotension , acute respiratory distress syndrome , pulmonary edema , myocardial infarction , tachycardia , and / or death ) .
Hepatic Disorders Transient reversible elevations in aminotransferases without any clinical signs or symptoms have also been reported during THYMOGLOBULIN administration .
Immunosuppression - Related Disorders Infections , reactivation of infection , febrile neutropenia , and sepsis have been reported after THYMOGLOBULIN administration in combination with multiple immunosuppressive agents , which may be fatal [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Malignancies including , but not limited to , lymphoproliferative disorders ( LPD ) and solid tumors have been reported .
These events have been associated with fatal outcome .
These adverse reactions were reported with use of a combination of multiple immunosuppressive agents [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Coagulopathy has been reported without clinical signs or symptoms of bleeding , and generally resolves within a few days .
Cases of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy have occurred secondary to anaphylaxis or infusion - associated reactions .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction studies have been performed .
THYMOGLOBULIN can stimulate the production of antibodies that cross - react with rabbit immune globulins [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with THYMOGLOBULIN .
It is also not known whether THYMOGLOBULIN can cause fetal harm .
THYMOGLOBULIN should be given to a pregnant woman only if the benefit outweighs the risk .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary THYMOGLOBULIN has not been studied in nursing women .
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because other immunoglobulins are excreted in human milk , breastfeeding should be discontinued during THYMOGLOBULIN therapy .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females There is a lack of information on the risks associated with the administration of THYMOGLOBULIN during pregnancy .
Therefore , effective contraception is recommended during and for a minimum of 3 months after treatment .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of THYMOGLOBULIN in pediatric patients have not been established in controlled trials .
However , based on limited European studies and U . S . compassionate use , the dose , efficacy , and adverse reaction profile are not thought to be different than for adults .
10 OVERDOSAGE THYMOGLOBULIN overdosage may result in leukopenia ( including lymphopenia and neutropenia ) and / or thrombocytopenia , which can be managed with dose reduction [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 3 ) ] .

All human red blood cells are from U . S . - registered or FDA - licensed blood banks .
A virus removal step ( nanofiltration , using a 20 nm filter ) and a viral inactivation step ( pasteurization , i . e . , heat treatment of active ingredient at 60 ° C / 10 hr ) are performed for each lot .
Each THYMOGLOBULIN lot is released following potency testing ( lymphocytotoxicity and E - rosette inhibition assays ) , and cross - reactive antibody testing ( hemagglutination , platelet agglutination , antiglomerular basement membrane antibody , and fibroblast toxicity assays on every lot ) .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action by which polyclonal antilymphocyte preparations suppress immune responses is not fully understood .
Possible mechanisms by which THYMOGLOBULIN may induce immunosuppression in vivo include : T - cell clearance from the circulation and modulation of T - cell activation , homing , and cytotoxic activities .
THYMOGLOBULIN includes antibodies against T - cell markers such as CD2 , CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD11a , CD18 , CD25 , CD44 , CD45 , HLA - DR , HLA Class I heavy chains , and ß2 micro - globulin .
In vitro , THYMOGLOBULIN ( concentrations > 0 . 1 mg / mL ) mediates T - cell suppressive effects via inhibition of proliferative responses to several mitogens .
In patients , T - cell depletion is usually observed within a day after initiating THYMOGLOBULIN therapy .
THYMOGLOBULIN has not been shown to be effective for treating antibody - mediated ( humoral ) rejections .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics After an intravenous dose of 1 . 25 to 1 . 5 mg / kg / day ( over 4 hours for 7 – 11 days ) 4 – 8 hours post infusion , THYMOGLOBULIN levels were on average 21 . 5 mcg / mL ( 10 – 40 mcg / mL ) with a half - life of 2 – 3 days after the first dose , and 87 mcg / mL ( 23 – 170 mcg / mL ) after the last dose .
During the THYMOGLOBULIN Phase 3 randomized trial for the treatment of acute rejection , of the 108 of 163 patients evaluated , anti - rabbit antibodies developed in 68 % of the THYMOGLOBULIN - treated patients , and anti - horse antibodies developed in 78 % of the Active Comparator - treated patients .
No controlled studies have been conducted to study the effect of anti - rabbit antibodies on repeat use of THYMOGLOBULIN .
However , to ensure that T - cell depletion is achieved upon retreatment with THYMOGLOBULIN , monitoring the lymphocyte count is recommended .
T - cell counts based on data collected from a limited number of patients ( n = 12 ) in this study , are presented in the chart below .
These data were collected using flow cytometry ( FACSCAN , Becton - Dickinson ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Prophylaxis of Acute Rejection in Patients Receiving a Kidney Transplant Study 1 THYMOGLOBULIN was evaluated in an open - label , randomized , active - controlled study in kidney transplant patients ( n = 278 ) at increased risk of acute rejection or delayed graft function .
The treatment failure rate within 12 months post - transplantation was statistically significantly lower in the THYMOGLOBULIN group than in the Active Comparator group ( 25 % vs 38 % ; p = 0 . 02 ) , based on the composite endpoint ( biopsy - proven acute rejection [ BPAR ] , graft loss [ GL ] , or death , with " lost to follow - up " considered as a treatment failure ) .
The individual elements of the composite endpoint were BPAR ( 13 % vs 21 % ) , GL ( 8 % vs 10 % ) , and death ( 4 % vs 4 % ) for the THYMOGLOBULIN and Active Comparator groups , respectively ( Table 7 ) .

[ 3 ] P - value obtained by comparison of treatment groups using Fisher ' s exact test .
[ 4 ] Lost to follow - up is defined as not having BPAR , GL , or death within 12 months after transplantation , and last visit date was prior to the lower bound of 12 - month window ( 12 months ± 30 days after transplantation ) .
The composite endpoint is defined as the occurrence of any of the following : BPAR ( Grade I – III ) , graft loss , death , or lost to follow - up .
Except for patients counted as " lost to follow - up , " a patient can be counted in more than one category for the individual components ( BPAR , graft loss , death ) .
In Study 1 , patients received either THYMOGLOBULIN ( n = 141 ) 1 . 5 mg / kg daily for a total of 5 doses ( Day 0 to Day 4 ) or Active Comparator ( n = 137 ) 2 doses of 20 mg each ( Day 0 , Day 4 ) .
For both treatment groups , the first induction treatment was initiated prior to the reperfusion of the kidney .
All patients received triple maintenance immunosuppression ( cyclosporine , mycophenolate mofetil , and corticosteroids ) throughout the 12 months of the study .
Recipient disease characteristics were balanced between the 2 treatment groups with similar distribution of prior transplant , degree of sensitization and number of mismatched human leukocyte antigens ( HLA ) .
Overall , the mean percentage of pretransplant panel - reactive antibody ( PRA ) was 6 % and the historical peak was 14 % .
The number of patients having a higher level of sensitization with PRA > 20 % was similar in the THYMOGLOBULIN ( 9 % ) and Active Comparator ( 10 % ) groups .
The mean number of mismatched HLAs was evenly distributed across the 2 treatment groups .
Study 2 THYMOGLOBULIN was evaluated in an open - label , parallel - arm , randomized , active - controlled , investigator - sponsored study in kidney transplant patients ( n = 230 ) at higher immunological risk of rejection .
The noninferiority of THYMOGLOBULIN to Active Comparator was achieved with treatment failure rates of 25 % versus 34 % , with an estimated treatment group difference ( THYMOGLOBULIN – Active Comparator ) of - 9 % ( 95 % CI : - 19 . 9 % to 3 . 6 % ) , based on the composite endpoint ( BPAR , GL , or death , with lost to follow - up considered as a treatment failure ) in the 12 months after transplantation .
The individual elements of the composite endpoint were BPAR ( 11 % vs 21 % ) , GL ( 15 % vs 11 % ) , and death ( 4 % vs 3 % ) for the THYMOGLOBULIN and Active Comparator groups , respectively ( Table 8 ) .

[ 3 ] Lost to follow - up is defined as not having BPAR ( Grade I – III ) , GL , or death within 12 months post - transplantation , and last visit date was prior to the lower bound of 12 month window ( 12 months ± 30 days post - transplantation ) .
In Study 2 , patients received either THYMOGLOBULIN ( n = 114 ) 1 . 25 mg / kg daily for a total of 8 doses ( Day 0 to Day 7 ) or Active Comparator ( n = 116 ) 1 mg / kg ( maximum dose 100 mg ) on Days 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 , and 56 .
For both treatment groups , the first induction treatment was initiated prior to the beginning of the surgical procedure .
All patients received triple maintenance immunosuppression ( tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil , and corticosteroids ) throughout the 12 months of the study .
Recipient disease characteristics were balanced between the 2 treatment groups , including similar distribution of prior transplant , degree of sensitization and number of HLA mismatches .
The number of patients having prior transplants was 163 of 230 ( 71 % ) .
Overall , the mean percentage of pretransplant PRA was 35 % and the historical peak was 72 % .
The number of patients having a higher level of sensitization with PRA > 20 % was similar in the THYMOGLOBULIN ( 55 % ) and Active Comparator ( 58 % ) groups .
The mean number of HLA mismatches was evenly distributed across the 2 treatment groups .
14 . 2 Treatment of Acute Rejection in Patients Receiving a Kidney Transplant A controlled , double - blind , multicenter , randomized clinical trial comparing THYMOGLOBULIN and Active Comparator was conducted at 28 US transplant centers in renal transplant patients ( n = 163 ) with biopsy - proven Banff Grade II ( moderate ) , Grade III ( severe ) , or steroid - resistant Grade I ( mild ) acute graft rejection .
This clinical trial met the non - inferiority criteria for THYMOGLOBULIN relative to Active Comparator in reversing acute rejection episodes with a 20 % non - inferiority margin .
The overall weighted estimate of the treatment difference ( THYMOGLOBULIN – Active Comparator success rate ) was 11 % with a lower 95 % confidence bound of 0 . 07 % .
Therefore , THYMOGLOBULIN was not inferior to Active Comparator in reversing acute rejection episodes .
In the study , patients were randomized to receive 7 to 14 days of THYMOGLOBULIN ( 1 . 5 mg / kg / day ) or Active Comparator ( 15 mg / kg / day ) .
For the entire study , the two treatment groups were comparable with respect to donor and recipient characteristics .
In Table 9 , successful treatment is presented as those patients whose serum creatinine levels ( 14 days from the diagnosis of rejection ) returned to baseline and whose graft was functioning on Day 30 after the end of therapy .
