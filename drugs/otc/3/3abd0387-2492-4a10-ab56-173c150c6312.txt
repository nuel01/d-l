• • Increased acalabrutinib concentrations may result in increased toxicity .
Prevention or Management • • Avoid co - administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors with CALQUENCE .
• • Alternatively , if the inhibitor will be used short - term , interrupt CALQUENCE [ see Recommended Dosage for Drug Interactions ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact • • Co - administration of CALQUENCE with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor may increase acalabrutinib plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
• • Increased acalabrutinib concentrations may result in increased toxicity .
Prevention or Management • • When CALQUENCE is co - administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors , reduce acalabrutinib dose to 100 mg once daily .
Strong CYP3A Inducers Clinical Impact • • Co - administration of CALQUENCE with a strong CYP3A inducer ( rifampin ) decreased acalabrutinib plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
• • Decreased acalabrutinib concentrations may reduce CALQUENCE activity .
Prevention or Management • • Avoid co - administration of strong CYP3A inducers with CALQUENCE .
• • If a strong CYP3A inducer cannot be avoided , increase the acalabrutinib dose to 200 mg approximately every 12 hours .
Gastric Acid Reducing Agents Clinical Impact • • Co - administration of CALQUENCE with a proton pump inhibitor , H2 - receptor antagonist , or antacid may decrease acalabrutinib plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

In animal reproduction studies , administration of acalabrutinib to animals during organogenesis resulted in dystocia in rats and reduced fetal growth in rabbits at maternal exposures ( AUC ) 2 times exposures in patients at the recommended dose of 100 mg approximately every 12 hours ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a combined fertility and embryo - fetal development study in female rats , acalabrutinib was administered orally at doses up to 200 mg / kg / day starting 14 days prior to mating through gestational day [ GD ] 17 .
No effects on embryo - fetal development and survival were observed .
The AUC at 200 mg / kg / day in pregnant rats was approximately 9 - times the AUC in patients at the recommended dose of 100 mg approximately every 12 hours .
The presence of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were confirmed in fetal rat plasma .
In an embryo - fetal development study in rabbits , pregnant animals were administered acalabrutinib orally at doses up to 200 mg / kg / day during the period of organogenesis ( from GD 6 - 18 ) .
Administration of acalabrutinib at doses ≥ 100 mg / kg / day produced maternal toxicity and 100 mg / kg / day resulted in decreased fetal body weights and delayed skeletal ossification .
The AUC at 100 mg / kg / day in pregnant rabbits was approximately 2 - times the AUC in patients at 100 mg approximately every 12 hours .
In a pre - and postnatal development study in rats , acalabrutinib was administered orally to pregnant animals during organogenesis , parturition and lactation , at doses of 50 , 100 , and 150 mg / kg / day .
Dystocia ( prolonged or difficult labor ) and mortality of offspring were observed at doses ≥ 100 mg / kg / day .
The AUC at 100 mg / kg / day in pregnant rats was approximately 2 - times the AUC in patients at 100 mg approximately every 12 hours .
Underdeveloped renal papilla was also observed in F1 generation offspring at 150 mg / kg / day with an AUC approximately 5 - times the AUC in patients at 100 mg approximately every 12 hours .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of acalabrutinib or its active metabolite in human milk , its effects on the breastfed child , or on milk production .
Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were present in the milk of lactating rats .
Due to the potential for adverse reactions in a breastfed child from CALQUENCE , advise lactating women not to breastfeed while taking CALQUENCE and for at least 2 weeks after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating CALQUENCE therapy .
Contraception Females CALQUENCE may cause embryo - fetal harm and dystocia when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CALQUENCE and for at least 1 week following the last dose of CALQUENCE .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to a fetus .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of CALQUENCE in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 929 patients with CLL or MCL in clinical trials of CALQUENCE , 68 % were 65 years of age or older , and 24 % were 75 years of age or older .
Among patients 65 years of age or older , 59 % had Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions and 39 % had serious adverse reactions .
Among patients younger than age 65 , 45 % had Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions and 25 % had serious adverse reactions .
No clinically relevant differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years and younger .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Avoid administration of CALQUENCE in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
The safety of CALQUENCE has not been evaluated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Recommended Dosage for Hepatic Impairment ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION CALQUENCE ( acalabrutinib ) is an inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) .
The molecular formula for acalabrutinib is C26H23N7O2 , and the molecular weight is 465 . 51 .
The chemical name is 4 - { 8 - amino - 3 - [ ( 2 S ) - 1 - ( but - 2 - ynoyl ) pyrrolidin - 2 - yl ] imidazo [ 1 , 5 - a ] pyrazin - 1 - yl ) } - N - ( pyridine - 2 - yl ) benzamide .
The chemical structure of acalabrutinib is shown below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Acalabrutinib is a white to yellow powder with pH - dependent solubility .
It is freely soluble in water at pH values below 3 and practically insoluble at pH values above 6 .
CALQUENCE capsules for oral administration contains 100 mg acalabrutinib and the following inactive ingredients : silicified microcrystalline cellulose , partially pregelatinized starch , magnesium stearate , and sodium starch glycolate .
The capsule shell contains gelatin , titanium dioxide , yellow iron oxide , FD & C Blue 2 and is imprinted with edible black ink .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Acalabrutinib is a small - molecule inhibitor of BTK .
Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite , ACP - 5862 , form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site , leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity .
BTK is a signaling molecule of the B cell antigen receptor ( BCR ) and cytokine receptor pathways .
In B cells , BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B - cell proliferation , trafficking , chemotaxis , and adhesion .
In nonclinical studies , acalabrutinib inhibited BTK - mediated activation of downstream signaling proteins CD86 and CD69 and inhibited malignant B - cell proliferation and tumor growth in mouse xenograft models .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with B - cell malignancies dosed with 100 mg approximately every 12 hours , median steady state BTK occupancy of ≥ 95 % in peripheral blood was maintained over 12 hours , resulting in inactivation of BTK throughout the recommended dosing interval .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of acalabrutinib on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized , double - blind , double - dummy , placebo ‑ and positive - controlled , 4 - way crossover thorough QTc study in 48 healthy adult subjects .
Administration of a single dose of acalabrutinib that is the 4 - fold maximum recommended single dose did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent ( i . e . , ≥ 10 ms ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Acalabrutinib exhibits dose - proportionality , and both acalabrutinib and its active metabolite , ACP - 5862 , exposures increase with dose across a dose range of 75 to 250 mg ( 0 . 75 to 2 . 5 times the approved recommended single dose ) in patients with B - cell malignancies .
At the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily , the geometric mean ( % coefficient of variation [ CV ] ) daily area under the plasma drug concentration over time curve ( AUC24h ) and maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) for acalabrutinib were 1843 ( 38 % ) ng • h / mL and 563 ( 29 % ) ng / mL , respectively , and for ACP - 5862 were 3947 ( 43 % ) ng • h / mL and 451 ( 52 % ) ng / mL , respectively .
Absorption The geometric mean absolute bioavailability of acalabrutinib was 25 % .
Median [ min , max ] time to peak acalabrutinib plasma concentrations ( Tmax ) was 0 . 9 [ 0 . 5 , 1 . 9 ] hours , and 1 . 6 [ 0 . 9 , 2 . 7 ] hour for ACP - 5862 .
Effect of Food In healthy subjects , administration of a single 75 mg dose of acalabrutinib ( 0 . 75 times the approved recommended single dose ) with a high - fat , high - calorie meal ( approximately 918 calories , 59 grams carbohydrate , 59 grams fat , and 39 grams protein ) did not affect the mean AUC as compared to dosing under fasted conditions .
Resulting Cmax decreased by 73 % and Tmax was delayed 1 - 2 hours .
Distribution Reversible binding to human plasma protein was 97 . 5 % for acalabrutinib and 98 . 6 % for ACP - 5862 .
The in vitro mean blood - to - plasma ratio was 0 . 8 for acalabrutinib and 0 . 7 for ACP - 5862 .
The geometric mean ( % CV ) steady - state volume of distribution ( Vss ) was approximately 101 ( 52 % ) L for acalabrutinib and 67 ( 32 % ) L for ACP - 5862 .
Elimination The geometric mean ( % CV ) terminal elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) was 1 ( 59 % ) hour for acalabrutinib and 3 . 5 ( 24 % ) hours for ACP - 5862 .
The geometric mean ( % CV ) apparent oral clearance ( CL / F ) was 71 ( 35 % ) L / hr for acalabrutinib and 13 ( 42 % ) L / hr for ACP - 5862 .
Metabolism Acalabrutinib is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A enzymes , and to a minor extent , by glutathione conjugation and amide hydrolysis , based on in vitro studies .
ACP - 5862 was identified as the major active metabolite in plasma with a geometric mean exposure ( AUC ) that was approximately 2 - to 3 - fold higher than the exposure of acalabrutinib .
ACP - 5862 is approximately 50 % less potent than acalabrutinib with regard to BTK inhibition .
Excretion Following administration of a single 100 mg radiolabeled acalabrutinib dose in healthy subjects , 84 % of the dose was recovered in the feces and 12 % of the dose was recovered in the urine , with less than 2 % of the dose excreted as unchanged acalabrutinib in urine and feces .
Specific Populations Age , Race , and Body Weight Age ( 32 to 90 years ) , sex , race ( Caucasian , African American ) , and body weight ( 40 to 149 kg ) did not have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite , ACP - 5862 .
Renal Impairment No clinically relevant PK difference was observed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment ( eGFR ≥ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 , as estimated by MDRD ( modification of diet in renal disease equation ) ) .
Acalabrutinib PK has not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment ( eGFR < 29 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 , MDRD ) or renal impairment requiring dialysis .
Hepatic Impairment The AUC of acalabrutinib increased 1 . 9 - fold in subjects with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class A ) , 1 . 5 - fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) and 5 . 3 - fold in subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class C ) compared to subjects with normal liver function .
No clinically relevant PK difference in ACP - 5862 was observed in subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) compared to subjects with normal liver function .
No clinically relevant PK differences in acalabrutinib and ACP - 5862 were observed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin less and equal to upper limit of normal [ ULN ] and AST greater than ULN , or total bilirubin greater than ULN and any AST ) relative to patients with normal hepatic function ( total bilirubin and AST within ULN ) .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Acalabrutinib Co - administration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor ( 200 mg itraconazole once daily for 5 days ) increased the acalabrutinib Cmax by 3 . 9 - fold and AUC by 5 . 1 - fold in healthy subjects .
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) simulations with acalabrutinib and moderate CYP3A inhibitors ( erythromycin , fluconazole , diltiazem ) showed that co - administration increased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC approximately 2 - to 3 - fold .
Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Acalabrutinib Co - administration with a strong CYP3A inducer ( 600 mg rifampin once daily for 9 days ) decreased acalabrutinib Cmax by 68 % and AUC by 77 % in healthy subjects .
Gastric Acid Reducing Agents Acalabrutinib solubility decreases with increasing pH . Co - administration with an antacid ( 1 g calcium carbonate ) decreased acalabrutinib AUC by 53 % in healthy subjects .
Co - administration with a proton pump inhibitor ( 40 mg omeprazole for 5 days ) decreased acalabrutinib AUC by 43 % .
In Vitro Studies Metabolic Pathways Acalabrutinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 / 5 , CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 , but does not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , UGT1A1 , and UGT2B7 .
ACP - 5862 is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 , but does not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2D6 , CYP3A4 / 5 , UGT1A1 , and UGT2B7 .
Acalabrutinib is a weak inducer of CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 ; ACP - 5862 weakly induces CYP3A4 .
Based on in vitro data and PBPK modeling , no interaction with CYP substrates is expected at clinically relevant concentrations .
Drug Transporter Systems Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite , ACP - 5862 , are substrates of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) .
Acalabrutinib is not a substrate of renal uptake transporters OAT1 , OAT3 , and OCT2 , or hepatic transporters OATP1B1 , and OATP1B3 .
ACP - 5862 is not a substrate of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 .
Acalabrutinib and ACP - 5862 do not inhibit P - gp , OAT1 , OAT3 , OCT2 , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , and MATE2 - K at clinically relevant concentrations .
Acalabrutinib may increase exposure to co - administered BCRP substrates ( e . g . , methotrexate ) by inhibition of intestinal BCRP .
ACP - 5862 does not inhibit BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations .
Acalabrutinib does not inhibit MATE1 , while ACP - 5862 may increase exposure to co - administered MATE1 substrates ( e . g . , metformin ) by inhibition of MATE1 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with acalabrutinib .
Acalabrutinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( AMES ) assay or clastogenic in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay or in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay .
In a fertility study in rats , there were no effects of acalabrutinib on fertility in male rats at exposures 11 ‑ times , or in female rats at exposures 9 ‑ times the AUC observed in patients at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Mantle Cell Lymphoma The efficacy of CALQUENCE was based upon Trial LY - 004 titled “ An Open - label , Phase 2 Study of ACP - 196 in Subjects with Mantle Cell Lymphoma ” ( NCT02213926 ) .

The median time to onset of lymphocytosis was 1 . 1 weeks and the median duration of lymphocytosis was 6 . 7 weeks .
14 . 2 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia The efficacy of CALQUENCE in patients with CLL was demonstrated in two randomized , controlled trials .
The indication for CALQUENCE includes patients with SLL because it is the same disease .
ELEVATE - TN The efficacy of CALQUENCE was evaluated in the ELEVATE - TN trial , a randomized , multicenter , open - label , actively controlled , 3 arm trial of CALQUENCE in combination with obinutuzumab , CALQUENCE monotherapy , and obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil in 535 patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( NCT02475681 ) .
Patients 65 years of age or older or between 18 and 65 years of age with a total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale ( CIRS ) > 6 or creatinine clearance of 30 to 69 mL / min were enrolled .
The trial also required hepatic transaminases ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal ( ULN ) and total bilirubin ≤ 1 . 5 times ULN , and excluded patients with Richter ’ s transformation .
Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio into 3 arms to receive : • • CALQUENCE plus obinutuzumab ( CALQUENCE + G ) : CALQUENCE 100 mg was administered approximately every 12 hours starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .

ASCEND The efficacy of CALQUENCE in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL was based upon a multicenter , randomized , open - label trial ( ASCEND ; NCT02970318 ) .
The trial enrolled 310 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL after at least 1 prior systemic therapy .
The trial excluded patients with transformed disease , prolymphocytic leukemia , or previous treatment with venetoclax , a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor , or a phosphoinositide - 3 kinase inhibitor .
Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either : • • CALQUENCE 100 mg approximately every 12 hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity , or • • Investigator ’ s choice : • • Idelalisib plus a rituximab product ( IR ) : Idelalisib 150 mg orally approximately every 12 hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity , in combination with 8 infusions of a rituximab product ( 375 mg / m2 intravenously on Day 1 of Cycle 1 , followed by 500 mg / m2 every 2 weeks for 4 doses and then every 4 weeks for 3 doses ) , with a 28 - day cycle length .
• • Bendamustine plus a rituximab product ( BR ) : Bendamustine 70 mg / m2 intravenously ( Day 1 and 2 of each 28 - day cycle ) , in combination with a rituximab product ( 375 mg / m2 intravenously on Day 1 of Cycle 1 , then 500 mg / m2 on Day 1 of subsequent cycles ) , for up to 6 cycles .
Randomization was stratified by 17 p deletion mutation status , ECOG performance status ( 0 or 1 versus 2 ) , and number of prior therapies ( 1 to 3 versus ≥ 4 ) .
Of 310 patients total , 155 were assigned to CALQUENCE monotherapy , 119 to IR , and 36 to BR .
