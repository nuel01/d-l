DORYX is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • The use of drugs of the tetracycline - class during tooth development ( last half of pregnancy , infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years ) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth ( yellow - gray - brown ) .
( 5 . 1 ) • Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported : Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 2 ) • Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines .
Limit sun exposure .
( 5 . 3 ) • Overgrowth of non - susceptible organisms , including fungi , may occur .
If such infections occur , discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Tooth Development The use of drugs of the tetracycline - class during tooth development ( last half of pregnancy , infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years ) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth ( yellow - gray - brown ) .
This adverse reaction is more common during long - term use of the drugs but it has been observed following repeated short - term courses .
Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported .
Use DORYX in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life - threatening conditions ( e . g . , anthrax , Rocky Mountain spotted fever ) , particularly when there are no alternative therapies .
5 . 2 Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including DORYX Tablets , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibacterial treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 3 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines .
Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs , and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema .
5 . 4 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth DORYX may result in overgrowth of non - susceptible organisms , including fungi .
If superinfection occurs , the antibacterial should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
5 . 5 Severe Skin Reactions Severe skin reactions , such as exfoliative dermatitis , erythema multiforme , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis , and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
If severe skin reactions occur , doxycycline should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be instituted .
5 . 6 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension ( IH , pseudotumor cerebri ) has been associated with the use of tetracycline including DORYX .
Clinical manifestations of IH include headache , blurred vision , diplopia , and vision loss ; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy .
Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH .
Avoid concomitant use of isotretinoin and DORYX because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri .
Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment , the possibility for permanent visual loss exists .
If visual disturbance occurs during treatment , prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted .
Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize .
5 . 7 Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone - forming tissue .
A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg / kg every six hours .
This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued .
Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta , are found in fetal tissues , and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus ( often related to retardation of skeletal development ) .
Evidence of embryotoxicity also has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy .
If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
5 . 8 Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN .
Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function .
5 . 9 Malaria Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium strains .
Doxycycline does not suppress P . falciparum ' s sexual blood stage gametocytes .
Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas .
5 . 10 Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria Prescribing DORYX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
5 . 11 Laboratory Monitoring for Long - Term Therapy In long - term therapy , periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems , including hematopoietic , renal , and hepatic studies should be performed .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions observed in patients receiving tetracyclines include anorexia , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , rash , photosensitivity , urticaria , and hemolytic anemia .
( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Mayne Pharma at 1 - 844 - 825 - 8500 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience The safety and efficacy of DORYX Tablets , 200 mg as a single daily dose was evaluated in a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , active - controlled study .
DORYX Tablets , 200 mg was given orally once - a - day for 7 days and compared to doxycycline hyclate capsules 100 mg given orally twice daily for 7 days for the treatment of men and women with uncomplicated urogenital C . trachomatis infection .
Adverse reactions in the Safety Population were reported by 99 ( 40 . 2 % ) subjects in the DORYX Tablets , 200 mg treatment group and 132 ( 53 . 2 % ) subjects in the doxycycline hyclate capsules reference treatment group .
Most adverse reactions were mild in intensity .
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in both treatment groups were nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and bacterial vaginitis , Table 1 .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions Reported in Greater than or Equal to 2 % of SubjectsAdverse Reactions DORYX Tablets , 200 mg N = 246 n ( % ) Subjects with any AE 99 ( 40 . 2 ) Nausea 33 ( 13 . 4 ) Vomiting 20 ( 8 . 1 ) Headache 5 ( 2 . 0 ) Diarrhea 8 ( 3 . 3 ) Abdominal Pain Upper 5 ( 2 . 0 ) Vaginitis Bacterial 8 ( 3 . 3 ) Vulvovaginal Mycotic Infection 5 ( 2 . 0 ) Because clinical trials are conducted under prescribed conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trial may not always reflect the rates observed in practice .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of doxycycline .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Due to oral doxycycline ' s virtually complete absorption , side effects to the lower bowel , particularly diarrhea , have been infrequent .
The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines : Gastrointestinal : Anorexia , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , glossitis , dysphagia , enterocolitis , inflammatory lesions ( with monilial overgrowth ) in the anogenital region and pancreatitis .
Hepatotoxicity has been reported .
These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines .
Superficial discoloration of the adult permanent dentition , reversible upon drug discontinuation and professional dental cleaning has been reported .
Permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia may occur with drugs of the tetracycline class when used during tooth development [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline - class .
Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Skin : Maculopapular and erythematous rashes , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis , exfoliative dermatitis , and erythema multiforme have been reported .
Photosensitivity is discussed above [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Renal : Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose - related [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
Hypersensitivity reactions : Urticaria , angioneurotic edema , anaphylaxis , anaphylactoid purpura , serum sickness , pericarditis , and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus , and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) .
Blood : Hemolytic anemia , thrombocytopenia , neutropenia , and eosinophilia have been reported .
Intracranial Hypertension : Intracranial hypertension ( IH , pseudotumor cerebri ) has been associated with the use of tetracycline [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] Thyroid Gland Changes : When given over prolonged periods , tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown - black microscopic discoloration of thyroid glands .
No abnormalities of thyroid function are known to occur .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage ( 7 . 1 ) • Avoid co - administration of tetracyclines with penicillin ( 7 . 2 ) • Absorption of tetracyclines , including DORYX , is impaired by antacids containing aluminum , calcium , or magnesium , bismuth subsalicylate and iron - containing preparations ( 7 . 3 ) • Concurrent use of tetracyclines , including DORYX , may render oral contraceptives less effective ( 7 . 4 ) • Barbiturates , carbamazepine and phenytoin decrease the half - life of doxycycline ( 7 . 5 ) 7 . 1 Anticoagulant Drugs Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity , patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage .
7 . 2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin , it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin .
7 . 3 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum , calcium , or magnesium , bismuth subsalicylate , and iron - containing preparations .
7 . 4 Oral Contraceptives Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective .
7 . 5 Barbiturates and Anti - Epileptics Barbiturates , carbamazepine , and phenytoin decrease the half - life of doxycycline .
7 . 6 Penthrane The concurrent use of tetracycline and Penthrane ® ( methoxyflurane ) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity .
7 . 7 Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamines may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Tetracycline - class drugs can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman , but data for doxycycline are limited .
( 5 . 6 , 8 . 1 ) • Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk ; however , the extent of absorption of doxycycline in the breastfed infant is not known .
DORYX use during nursing should be avoided if possible .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well - controlled studies on the use of doxycycline in pregnant women .
The vast majority of reported experience with doxycycline during human pregnancy is short - term , first trimester exposure .
There are no human data available to assess the effects of long - term therapy of doxycycline in pregnant women such as that proposed for the treatment of anthrax exposure .
An expert review of published data on experiences with doxycycline use during pregnancy by TERIS - the Teratogen Information System - concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk ( the quantity and quality of data were assessed as limited to fair ) , but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk ( see Data ) . 1 In the US general population the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Embryo / Fetal Risk Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta , are found in fetal tissues , and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus ( often related to retardation of skeletal development ) .
Evidence of embryotoxicity also has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy .
If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
Data Human Data A case - control study ( 18 , 515 mothers of infants with congenital anomalies and 32 , 804 mothers of infants with no congenital anomalies ) shows a weak but marginally statistically significant association with total malformations and use of doxycycline anytime during pregnancy .
Sixty - three ( 0 . 19 % ) of the controls and 56 ( 0 . 30 % ) of the cases were treated with doxycycline .
This association was not seen when the analysis was confined to maternal treatment during the period of organogenesis ( that is , in the second and third months of gestation ) , with the exception of a marginal relationship with neural tube defect based on only two - exposed cases . 2 A small prospective study of 81 pregnancies describes 43 pregnant women treated for 10 days with doxycycline during early first trimester .
All mothers reported their exposed infants were normal at 1 year of age . 3 8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk , however , the extent of absorption of tetracyclines including doxycycline , by the breastfed infant is not known .
Short - term use by lactating women is not necessarily contraindicated .
The effects of prolonged exposure to doxycycline in breast milk production and breast fed neonates , infants and children are unknown4 .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for DORYX and any potential adverse effects on the breast fed child from DORYX or from the underlying maternal condition [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric use Because of the effects of drugs of the tetracycline - class on tooth development and growth , use DORYX in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life - threatening conditions ( e . g . , anthrax , Rocky Mountain spotted fever ) , particularly , when there are no alternative therapies [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric use Clinical studies of DORYX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
DORYX 50 mg tablets contain 3 mg ( 0 . 131 mEq ) of sodium .
DORYX 80 mg tablets contain 4 . 8 mg ( 0 . 209 mEq ) of sodium .
DORYX 200 mg tablets contain 12 mg ( 0 . 522 mEq ) of sodium .
10 OVERDOSAGE In case of overdosage , discontinue medication , treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures .
Dialysis does not alter serum half - life and thus would not be of benefit in treating cases of overdosage .
11 DESCRIPTION DORYX ( doxycycline hyclate delayed - release tablets ) , contain specially coated pellets of doxycycline hyclate , a tetracycline class drug synthetically derived from oxytetracycline , in a delayed - release formulation for oral administration .
The structural formula for doxycycline hyclate is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] with a molecular formula of C22H24N2O8 , HCl , ½ C2H6O , ½ H2O and a molecular weight of 512 . 9 .
The chemical name for doxycycline hyclate is [ 4 S ( 4 aR , 5 S , 5 aR , 6 R , 12 aS ) ] - 4 - ( dimethylamino ) - 1 , 4 , 4 a , 5 , 5 a , 6 , 11 , 12 a - octahydro - 3 , 5 , 10 , 12 , 12 a - pentahydroxy - 6 - methyl - 1 , 11 - deoxonaphthacene - 2 - carboxamide monohydrochloride , compound with ethyl alcohol ( 2 : 1 ) , monohydrate .
Doxycycline hyclate is a yellow crystalline powder soluble in water and in solutions of alkali hydroxides and carbonates .
Doxycycline has a high degree of lipid solubility and a low affinity for calcium binding .
It is highly stable in normal human serum .
Doxycycline will not degrade into an epianhydro form .
Each tablet contains doxycycline 50 mg , 80 mg or 200 mg ( equivalent to doxycycline hyclate 57 . 7 mg , 92 . 3 mg or 230 . 8 mg ) .
Inactive ingredients in the tablet formulation are : lactose monohydrate ; microcrystalline cellulose ; sodium lauryl sulfate ; sodium chloride ; talc ; anhydrous lactose ; corn starch ; crospovidone ; magnesium stearate ; cellulosic polymer coating .
Each DORYX 50 mg tablet contains 3 mg ( 0 . 131 mEq ) of sodium , each DORYX 80 mg tablet contains 4 . 8 mg ( 0 . 209 mEq ) of sodium , and each DORYX 200 mg tablet contains 12 mg ( 0 . 522 mEq ) of sodium .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Doxycycline is a tetracycline - class antimicrobial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following single and multiple - dose administration of DORYX Tablets , 200 mg to adult volunteers , average peak plasma doxycycline concentration ( Cmax ) was 4 . 6 mcg / mL and 6 . 3 mcg / mL , respectively with median tmax of 3 hours ; the corresponding mean plasma concentration values 24 hours after single and multiple doses were 1 . 5 mcg / mL and 2 . 3 mcg / mL , respectively .
Absorption Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration .
Effect of Food The mean Cmax and AUC 0 - ∞ of doxycycline are 24 % and 13 % lower , respectively , following single dose administration of DORYX Tablets , 100 mg with a high fat meal ( including milk ) compared to fasted conditions .
The mean Cmax of doxycycline is 19 % lower and the AUC 0 - ∞ is unchanged following single dose administration of DORYX Tablets , 150 mg with a high fat meal ( including milk ) compared to fasted conditions .
The clinical significance of these decreases is unknown .
Doxycycline bioavailability from DORYX Tablets , 200 mg was not affected by food , but the incidence of nausea was higher in fasted subjects .
The 200 mg tablets may be administered without regard to meals .
When DORYX Tablets are sprinkled over applesauce and taken with or without water , the extent of doxycycline absorption is unchanged , but the rate of absorption is increased slightly .
Elimination Tetracyclines are concentrated in bile by the liver and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form .
Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40 % / 72 hours in individuals with a creatinine clearance of about 75 mL / min .
This percentage may fall as low as 1 - 5 % / 72 hours in individuals with a creatinine clearance below 10 mL / min .
Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Studies have shown no significant difference in the serum half - life of doxycycline ( range 18 to 22 hours ) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function .
Hemodialysis does not alter the serum half - life .
Pediatric Patients Population pharmacokinetic analysis of sparse concentration - time data of doxycycline following standard of care intravenous and oral dosing in 44 children ( 2 - 18 years of age ) showed that allometrically - scaled clearance of doxycycline in children ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years of age ( median [ range ] 3 . 58 [ 2 . 27 - 10 . 82 ] L / h / 70 kg , N = 11 ) did not differ significantly from children > 8 to 18 years of age ( 3 . 27 [ 1 . 11 - 8 . 12 ] L / h / 70 kg , N = 33 ) .
For pediatric patients weighing ≤ 45 kg , body weight normalized doxycycline CL in those ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years of age ( median [ range ] 0 . 071 [ 0 . 041 - 0 . 202 ] L / kg / h , N = l0 ) did not differ significantly from those > 8 to 18 years of age ( 0 . 081 [ 0 . 035 - 0 . 126 ] L / kg / h , N = 8 ) .
In pediatric patients weighing > 45 kg no clinically significant differences in body weight normalized doxycycline CL were observed between those ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years ( 0 . 050 L / kg / h , N = l ) and those > 8 years of age ( 0 . 044 [ 0 . 014 - 0 . 121 ] L / kg / h , N = 25 ) .
No clinically significant difference in CL differences between oral and IV were observed in the small cohort of pediatric patients who received the oral ( N = l9 ) or IV ( N = 21 ) formulation alone .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30 S ribosomal subunit .
Doxycycline has bacteriostatic activity against a broad range of Gram - positive and Gram - negative bacteria .
Resistance Cross - resistance between tetracyclines is common .
Antimicrobial Activity Doxycycline has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections .
[ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Gram - Negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Shigella species Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Gram - Positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Streptococcus pneumoniae Anaerobic Bacteria Clostridium species Fusobacterium fusiforme Propionibacterium acnes Other Bacteria Norcardiae and other aerobic Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Mycoplasma pneumoniae Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Parasites Balantidium coli Entamoeba species Plasmodium falciparum [ 1 ] Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria , associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug , please see : https : / / www . fda . gov / STIC .
[ 1 ] Doxycycline has been found to be active against the asexual erythrocytic forms of Plasmodium falciparum but not against the gametocytes of P . falciparum .
The precise mechanism of action of the drug is not known .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of doxycycline have not been conducted .
However , there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with the related antibacterials , oxytetracycline ( adrenal and pituitary tumors ) and minocycline ( thyroid tumors ) .
Likewise , although mutagenicity studies of doxycycline have not been conducted , positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays have been reported for related antibacterials ( tetracycline , oxytetracycline ) .
Doxycycline administered orally at dosage levels as high as 250 mg / kg / day had no apparent effect on the fertility of female rats .
Effect on male fertility has not been studied .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Hyperpigmentation of the thyroid has been produced by members of the tetracycline - class in the following species : in rats by oxytetracycline , doxycycline , tetracycline PO4 , and methacycline ; in minipigs by doxycycline , minocycline , tetracycline PO4 , and methacycline ; in dogs by doxycycline and minocycline ; in monkeys by minocycline .
Minocycline , tetracycline PO4 , methacycline , doxycycline , tetracycline base , oxytetracycline HCl , and tetracycline HCl , were goitrogenic in rats fed a low iodine diet .
This goitrogenic effect was accompanied by high radioactive iodine uptake .
Administration of minocycline also produced a large goiter with high radioiodine uptake in rats fed a relatively high iodine diet .
Treatment of various animal species with this class of drugs has also resulted in the induction of thyroid hyperplasia in the following : in rats and dogs ( minocycline ) ; in chickens ( chlortetracycline ) ; and in rats and mice ( oxytetracycline ) .
Adrenal gland hyperplasia has been observed in goats and rats treated with oxytetracycline .
Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta and are found in fetal tissues .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES This was a randomized , double - blind , active - controlled , multicenter trial which enrolled 495 subjects , between 19 to 45 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of urogenital C . trachomatis infection less than 14 days prior to enrollment , or partner ( s ) of a subject with a known positive test for urogenital C . trachomatis infection .
The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DORYX Tablets , 200 mg once daily versus doxycycline hyclate capsules , 100 mg twice daily for seven days for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital C . trachomatis infection .
The primary efficacy objective was to demonstrate non - inferiority of the DORYX Tablets , 200 mg once daily treatment regimen versus the doxycycline 100 mg twice daily treatment regimen for the indication using a negative nucleic acid amplification test ( NAAT ) at the test of cure visit ( day 28 ) in the mITT population ( subjects who were positive at baseline and took at least one day of study drug ) .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis : • that no present - day antimalarial agent , including doxycycline , guarantees protection against malaria .
• to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using personal protective measures that help avoid contact with mosquitoes , especially from dusk to dawn ( for example , staying in well - screened areas , using mosquito nets , covering the body with clothing , and using an effective insect repellent ) .
• that doxycycline prophylaxis : • should begin 1 to 2 days before travel to the malarious area , • should be continued daily while in the malarious area and after leaving the malarious area , • should be continued for 4 further weeks to avoid development of malaria after returning from an endemic area , • should not exceed 4 months .
Advise all patients taking doxycycline : • to avoid excessive sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while receiving doxycycline and to discontinue therapy if phototoxicity ( for example , skin eruptions , etc . ) occurs .
Sunscreen or sunblock should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• to drink fluids liberally along with doxycycline to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
• that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taken with foods , especially those that contain calcium .
However , the absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
• that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taken with antacids containing aluminum , calcium or magnesium , bismuth subsalicylate , and iron - containing preparations [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
• that the use of doxycycline might increase the incidence of vaginal candidiasis .
Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued .
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials , patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of antibacterial .
If this occurs , patients should contact their physician as soon as possible .
Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including DORYX should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When DORYX is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by DORYX or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
