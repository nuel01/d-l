When anticholinergics are given to children where the environmental temperature is high , there is a risk of a rapid increase in body temperature because of these medications ’ suppression of sweat gland activity .
A paradoxical reaction characterized by hyperexcitability may occur in children taking large doses of anticholinergics .
