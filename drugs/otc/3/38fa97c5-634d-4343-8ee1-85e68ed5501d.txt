( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thrombotic / Thromboembolic Complications : DOPTELET is a thrombopoietin ( TPO ) receptor agonist and TPO receptor agonists have been associated with thrombotic and thromboembolic complications in patients with chronic liver disease or chronic immune thrombocytopenia .
Monitor platelet counts .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events and institute treatment promptly .
( 5 . 1 ) 5 . 1 Thrombotic / Thromboembolic Complications DOPTELET is a thrombopoietin ( TPO ) receptor agonist and TPO receptor agonists have been associated with thrombotic and thromboembolic complications in patients with chronic liver disease or chronic immune thrombocytopenia .
In patients with chronic liver disease , thromboembolic events ( portal vein thrombosis ) occurred in 0 . 4 % ( 1 / 274 ) of patients receiving DOPTELET .
In patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia , thromboembolic events ( arterial or venous ) occurred in 7 % ( 9 / 128 ) of patients receiving DOPTELET .
Consider the potential increased thrombotic risk when administering DOPTELET to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism , including genetic prothrombotic conditions ( e . g . , Factor V Leiden , Prothrombin 20210 A , Antithrombin deficiency or Protein C or S deficiency ) .
DOPTELET should not be administered to patients with chronic liver disease or chronic immune thrombocytopenia in an attempt to normalize platelet counts .
Monitor platelet counts and follow the dosing guidelines to achieve target platelet counts [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Monitor patients receiving DOPTELET for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events and institute treatment promptly .

6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Patients with Chronic Liver Disease The safety of DOPTELET was evaluated in two international , identically designed , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials , ADAPT - 1 and ADAPT - 2 , in which 430 patients with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia received either DOPTELET ( n = 274 ) or placebo ( n = 156 ) daily for 5 days prior to a scheduled procedure , and had 1 post - dose safety assessment .
Patients were divided into two groups based on their mean platelet count at baseline : • Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort ( less than 40 × 109 / L ) who received DOPTELET 60 mg once daily for 5 days • High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort ( 40 to less than 50 × 109 / L ) who received DOPTELET 40 mg once daily for 5 days The majority of patients were males ( 65 % ) and median subject age was 58 years ( ranging from 19 - 86 years of age ) .
The racial and ethnic distribution was White ( 60 % ) , Asian ( 33 % ) , Black ( 3 % ) and Other ( 3 % ) .
The most common adverse reactions ( those occurring in ≥ 3 % of patients ) in the DOPTELET - treated groups ( 60 mg or 40 mg ) across the pooled data from the two trials are summarized in Table 5 .
Table 5 : Adverse Reactions with a Frequency ≥ 3 % in Patients with Chronic Liver DiseaseTreated with DOPTELET – Pooled Data ADAPT - 1 and ADAPT - 2 Adverse Reactions Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort ( ˂ 40 × 109 / L ) High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort ( ≥ 40 to ˂ 50 × 109 / L ) Combined Baseline Platelet Count Cohorts ( ˂ 50 × 109 / L ) DOPTELET 60 mg ( N = 159 ) % Placebo ( N = 91 ) % DOPTELET 40 mg ( N = 115 ) % Placebo ( N = 65 ) % Total DOPTELET ( N = 274 ) % Total Placebo ( N = 156 ) % Pyrexia 11 9 8 9 10 9 Abdominal Pain 6 7 7 6 7 6 Nausea 6 8 7 6 7 7 Headache 4 8 7 5 6 6 Fatigue 4 4 3 2 4 3 Edema Peripheral 3 2 4 2 3 2 For the Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort , the incidence of serious adverse reactions was 7 % ( 11 / 159 ) in the 60 mg DOPTELET treatment group .
For the High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort , the incidence of serious adverse reactions was 8 % ( 9 / 115 ) in the 40 mg DOPTELET treatment group .
The most common serious adverse reaction reported with DOPTELET was hyponatremia .
Two DOPTELET - treated patients ( 0 . 7 % ) developed hyponatremia .
Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of DOPTELET were anemia , pyrexia , and myalgia ; each was reported in a single ( 0 . 4 % ) patient in the DOPTELET ( 60 mg ) treatment group .
Patients with Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia The safety of DOPTELET was evaluated in four clinical trials in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia : two Phase 3 trials ( one randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial , and one randomized , double - blind , active - controlled trial ) and two Phase 2 trials ( one randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , dose - ranging , trial , and one open - label extension trial ) in 161 patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia in both the double - blind and open - label extension phases .
The pooled safety data from these four clinical trials includes 128 patients who received 2 . 5 to 40 mg of DOPTELET once daily for a median duration of exposure of 29 . 1 weeks and had 1 post - dose safety assessment .
The majority of patients were female ( 63 % ) and median subject age was 50 . 5 years ( ranging from 18 - 88 years of age ) .
The racial and ethnic distribution was White ( 84 % ) , Black ( 6 % ) , Asian ( 6 % ) and Other ( 6 % ) .
The most common adverse reactions ( those occurring in ≥ 10 % of patients ) in the DOPTELET - treated patients across the pooled safety data from the four trials are summarized in Table 6 .
Table 6 : Adverse Reactions with a Frequency ≥ 10 % in Patients with Chronic ImmuneThrombocytopenia Treated with DOPTELET – Pooled Data from Clinical Trials Adverse Reactions DOPTELET ( N = 128 ) % Placebo ( N = 22 ) % Headache 31 14 Fatigue 28 9 Contusion 26 18 Epistaxis 19 18 Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 15 5 Arthralgia 13 0 Gingival Bleeding 13 0 Petechiae 11 9 Nasopharyngitis 10 0 The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 9 % ( 12 / 128 ) in the DOPTELET treatment group .
Serious adverse reactions reported in more than 1 individual DOPTELET - treated patient included headache , occurring in 1 . 6 % ( 2 / 128 ) .
Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of DOPTELET that were reported in more than 1 patient included headache , occurring in 1 . 6 % ( 2 / 128 ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of DOPTELET .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity reactions including pruritus , rash , choking sensation , erythema , pharyngeal edema , pruritus generalized , rash macular , swelling face , and swollen tongue .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate or Strong Dual CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 Inducers or Inhibitors : Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Other Drugs on DOPTELET in Patients with Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia Moderate or Strong Dual Inhibitors of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 Concomitant use with a moderate or strong dual inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 increases avatrombopag AUC [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may increase the risk of DOPTELET toxicities .
Reduce the starting dosage of DOPTELET when used concomitantly with a moderate or strong dual inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 ( see Table 4 ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
In patients starting moderate or strong dual inhibitors of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 while receiving DOPTELET , monitor platelet counts and adjust DOPTELET dose as necessary ( see Table 3 ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Moderate or Strong Dual Inducers of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 Concomitant use with a moderate or strong dual inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 decreases avatrombopag AUC [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] which may reduce DOPTELET efficacy .
Increase the recommended starting dosage of DOPTELET when used concomitantly with a moderate or strong dual inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 ( see Table 4 ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
In patients starting moderate or strong dual inducers of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 while receiving DOPTELET , monitor platelet counts and adjust DOPTELET dose as necessary ( see Table 3 ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Patients with Chronic Liver Disease No dosage adjustments are required for patients with chronic liver disease .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm ( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal reproduction studies , DOPTELET may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman ( see Data ) .
The available data on DOPTELET in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of avatrombopag resulted in adverse developmental outcomes when administered during organogenesis in rabbits and during organogenesis and the lactation period in rats .
However , these findings were observed at exposures based on an AUC substantially higher than the AUC observed in patients at the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg once daily .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In embryo - fetal development studies , avatrombopag was administered during organogenesis at doses of 100 , 300 , and 1000 mg / kg / day in rats and doses of 100 , 300 , and 600 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
Minimal decreases in fetal weights were observed in rats at the maternally toxic dose of 1000 mg / kg / day with exposures 190 times the human exposure based on AUC .
Spontaneous abortions were observed at all doses tested in rabbits and were associated with decreased body weights and food consumption at 300 and 600 mg / kg / day ; exposures at the lowest dose of 100 mg / kg / day were 10 times the AUC in patients at the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg once daily .
There were no embryo - fetal effects in rats administered avatrombopag at doses up to 100 mg / kg / day ( 53 times the human exposure based on AUC ) or rabbits administered avatrombopag at doses up to 600 mg / kg ( 35 times the human exposure based on AUC ) .
In pre - and postnatal development studies in rats , avatrombopag was administered during both the organogenesis and lactation periods at doses ranging from 5 to 600 mg / kg / day .
Doses of 100 , 300 , and 600 mg / kg / day caused maternal toxicity leading to total litter losses , decreased body weight in pups , and increased pup mortality , with the majority of the pup mortality occurring from postnatal days 14 to 21 .
At a dose of 50 mg / kg / day that did not produce clear maternal toxicity , avatrombopag caused increased pup mortality from postnatal days 4 to 21 , and mortality continued through postnatal day 25 .
The 50 mg / kg / day dose also decreased body weight gain in the pups , resulting in a delay in sexual maturation .
There were no effects on behavioral or reproductive functions in the offspring .
The 50 mg / kg / day dose resulted in maternal exposures 43 times and pup exposures approximately 3 times the AUC observed in patients at the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg once daily .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of avatrombopag in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Avatrombopag was present in the milk of lactating rats .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely the drug will be present in human milk .
Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from DOPTELET , breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with DOPTELET and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose ( seeClinical Considerations ) .
Clinical Considerations MinimizingExposure A lactating woman receiving DOPTELET for brief periods , such as prior to an invasive procedure , should interrupt breastfeeding and pump and discard breastmilk during treatment and for two weeks after the last dose of DOPTELET in order to minimize exposure to a breastfed child .
Advise lactating women receiving chronic DOPTELET therapy not to breastfeed during treatment with DOPTELET and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
In a 10 - week juvenile toxicology study in rats , avatrombopag was administered at doses ranging from 20 to 300 mg / kg / day .
There was no test article - related mortality and there were no clinical signs at doses up to 300 mg / kg / day .
In the stomach , dose - dependent degeneration , regenerative hyperplasia , and atrophy of the glandular epithelium occurred at 100 and 300 mg / kg / day ; exposures at 100 mg / kg / day in male rats were 14 times the AUC in patients at the highest recommended dose of 60 mg once daily .
An increased incidence of background focal mineralization was also observed in the kidneys of females at 300 mg / kg / day ( female rat exposure was 50 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 60 mg daily dose ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of DOPTELET did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdose , platelet count may increase excessively and result in thrombotic or thromboembolic complications .
Closely monitor the patient and platelet count .
Treat thrombotic complications in accordance with standard of care .
No antidote for DOPTELET overdose is known .
Hemodialysis is not expected to enhance the elimination of DOPTELET because DOPTELET is only approximately 6 % renally excreted and is highly bound to plasma proteins .
11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in DOPTELET is avatrombopag maleate , a thrombopoietin receptor agonist .
The chemical name of avatrombopag maleate is 4 - piperidinecarboxylic acid , 1 - [ 3 - chloro - 5 - [ [ [ 4 - ( 4 - chloro - 2 - thienyl ) - 5 - ( 4 - cyclohexyl - 1 - piperazinyl ) - 2 - thiazolyl ] amino ] carbonyl ] - 2 - pyridinyl ] - , ( 2 Z ) - 2 - butenedioate ( 1 : 1 ) .
It has the molecular formula C29H34Cl2N6O3S2 · C4H4O4 .
The molecular weight is 765 . 73 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The aqueous solubility of avatrombopag maleate at various pH levels indicates that the drug substance is practically insoluble at pH 1 to 11 .
DOPTELET is provided as an immediate - release tablet .
Each DOPTELET tablet contains 20 mg avatrombopag ( equivalent to 23 . 6 mg of avatrombopag maleate ) and the following inactive ingredients : lactose monohydrate , colloidal silicon dioxide , crospovidone , magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose .
Coating film : polyvinyl alcohol , talc , polyethylene glycol , titanium dioxide and ferric oxide yellow .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Avatrombopag is an orally bioavailable , small molecule TPO receptor agonist that stimulates proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow progenitor cells , resulting in an increased production of platelets .
Avatrombopag does not compete with TPO for binding to the TPO receptor and has an additive effect with TPO on platelet production .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Platelet Response DOPTELET administered to adult patients resulted in dose - and exposure - dependent elevations in platelet counts .
The onset of the platelet count increase was observed within 3 to 5 days of the start of treatment , with peak effect after 10 to 13 days .
Post treatment , platelet counts decreased gradually , returning to near baseline values .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At exposures similar to that achieved at the 40 mg and 60 mg dose , DOPTELET did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
Mean QTc prolongation effects > 20 ms are not anticipated with the highest recommended therapeutic dosing regimen based on analysis of data from the pooled clinical trials in patients with chronic liver disease .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Avatrombopag demonstrated dose - proportional pharmacokinetics after single doses from 10 mg ( 0 . 5 times the lowest approved dosage ) to 80 mg ( 1 . 3 times the highest recommended dosage ) .
Healthy subjects administered 40 mg of avatrombopag had a geometric mean ( % CV ) maximal concentration ( Cmax ) of 166 ( 84 % ) ng / mL and area under the time - concentration curve extrapolated to infinity ( AUC0 - inf ) of 4198 ( 83 % ) ng . hr / mL .
The pharmacokinetics of avatrombopag were similar in both healthy subjects and the chronic liver disease population .
Absorption The median time to maximal concentration ( Tmax ) occurred at 5 to 6 hours post - dose .
Effect of Food Avatrombopag AUC0 - inf and Cmax were not affected when DOPTELET was co - administered with a low fat meal ( 500 calories , 3 g fat , 15 g protein , and 108 g carbohydrates ) or a high fat meal ( 918 calories , 59 g fat , 39 g protein , and 59 g carbohydrates ) .
The variability of avatrombopag exposure was reduced by 40 % to 60 % with food .
The Tmax of avatrombopag was delayed by 0 to 2 hours when DOPTELET was administered with a low - fat or high - fat meal ( median Tmax range 5 to 8 hours ) compared to the fasted state .
Distribution Avatrombopag has an estimated mean volume of distribution ( % CV ) of 180 L ( 25 % ) .
Avatrombopag is greater than 96 % bound to human plasma proteins .
Elimination The mean plasma elimination half - life ( % CV ) of avatrombopag is approximately 19 hours ( 19 % ) .
The mean ( % CV ) of the clearance of avatrombopag is estimated to be 6 . 9 L / hr ( 29 % ) .
Metabolism Avatrombopag is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 .
Excretion Fecal excretion accounted for 88 % of the administered dose , with 34 % of the dose excreted as unchanged avatrombopag .
Only 6 % of the administered dose was found in urine .
Specific Populations Age ( 18 - 86 years ) , body weight ( 39 - 175 kg ) , sex , race [ Whites , African - Americans , and East Asians ( i . e . , Japanese , Chinese and Koreans ) ] , and any hepatic impairment ( Child - Turcotte - Pugh ( CTP ) grade A , B , and C , or Model for End - Stage Liver Disease ( MELD ) score 4 - 23 ) and mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr ≥ 30 mL / min ) did not have clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of avatrombopag .
The effect of age ( < 18 years ) and severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min , Cockcroft - Gault ) including patients requiring hemodialysis on avatrombopag pharmacokinetics is unknown .
Drug Interactions Clinical Studies Table 7 summarizes the effect of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of avatrombopag .

In Vitro Studies Where Drug Interaction Potential Was Not Further Evaluated Clinically CYP enzymes : Avatrombopag does not inhibit CYP1A , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 or CYP3A , does not induce CYP1A , CYP2B6 , CYP2C , or CYP3A , and weakly induces CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 .
Transporter systems : Avatrombopag inhibits organic anion transporter ( OAT ) 3 and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , but not organic anion transporter polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 or 1B3 , organic cation transporter ( OCT ) 2 or OAT1 .
Avatrombopag is not a substrate for OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OCT2 , OAT1 or OAT3 .
12 . 5 Pharmacogenomics The CYP2C9 * 2 and CYP2C9 * 3 loss - of - function polymorphisms result in reduced CYP2C9 enzymatic activity .
In a pooled pharmacogenomic analysis of avatrombopag studies , subjects heterozygous for CYP2C9 loss - of - function polymorphisms ( intermediate metabolizers [ n = 24 ] ) had approximately 1 . 4 - fold higher exposure and subjects homozygous for CYP2C9 loss - of - function polymorphisms ( poor metabolizers [ n = 2 ] ) had approximately 2 - fold higher exposure compared to subjects wild - type for CYP2C9 ( normal metabolizers [ n = 94 ] ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In two - year carcinogenicity studies , avatrombopag was administered orally at doses of 20 , 60 , and 160 mg / kg / day in mice and doses of 20 , 50 , and 160 mg / kg / day in rats .
Avatrombopag induced a statistically significant increase in neuroendocrine cell ( enterochromaffin - like cell , ECL cell ) gastric tumors ( carcinoids ) in the stomach at 160 mg / kg in female rats .
The 160 mg / kg / day dose resulted in exposures 117 times the AUC observed in patients at the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg once daily .
The gastric carcinoids were considered likely due to prolonged hypergastrinemia observed in toxicity studies .
Hypergastrinemia - related gastric carcinoids in rodents are generally considered to be of low risk or relevance to humans .
Avatrombopag was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay or clastogenic in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberrations assay or in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Avatrombopag did not affect fertility or early embryonic development in male rats at exposures 22 times , or in female rats at exposures 114 times , the AUC observed in patients at the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg once daily .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Patients with Chronic Liver Disease The efficacy of DOPTELET for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure was established in 2 identically - designed multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials ( ADAPT - 1 [ NCT01972529 ] and ADAPT - 2 [ NCT01976104 ] ) .
In each trial , patients were assigned to the Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort ( < 40 × 109 / L ) or the High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort ( ≥ 40 to < 50 × 109 / L ) based on their platelet count at baseline .
Patients were then randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to either DOPTELET or placebo .
Patients were stratified according to hepatocellular cancer ( HCC ) status and risk of bleeding associated with the elective procedure ( low , moderate , or high ) .
Patients undergoing neurosurgical interventions , thoracotomy , laparotomy or organ resection were not eligible for enrollment .
Patients in the Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort received 60 mg DOPTELET or matching placebo once daily for 5 days , and patients in the High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort received 40 mg DOPTELET or matching placebo once daily for 5 days .
Eligible patients were scheduled to undergo their procedure ( low , moderate , or high bleeding risk ) 5 to 8 days after their last dose of treatment .
Patient populations were similar between the pooled Low and High Baseline Platelet Count Cohorts and consisted of 66 % male and 35 % female ; median age 58 years and 61 % White , 34 % Asian , and 3 % Black .
In ADAPT - 1 , a total of 231 patients were randomized , 149 patients were treated with DOPTELET and 82 patients were treated with placebo .
In the Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort , the mean baseline platelet count for the DOPTELET - treated group was 31 . 1 × 109 / L and for the placebo - treated patients was 30 . 7 × 109 / L .
In the High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort , the mean baseline platelet count for the DOPTELET - treated patients was 44 . 3 × 109 / L and for placebo - treated patients was 44 . 9 × 109 / L .
In ADAPT - 2 , a total of 204 patients were randomized , 128 patients were treated with DOPTELET and 76 patients were treated with placebo .
In the Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort , the mean baseline platelet count for the DOPTELET - treated group was 32 . 7 × 109 / L and for the placebo - treated patients was 32 . 5 × 109 / L .
In the High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort , the mean baseline platelet count for the DOPTELET - treated patients was 44 . 3 × 109 / L and for the placebo - treated patients was 44 . 5 × 109 / L .
Across both baseline platelet count cohorts and the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups , patients underwent a broad spectrum of types of scheduled procedures that ranged from low to high bleeding risk .
Overall , the majority of patients ( 60 . 8 % [ 248 / 430 ] subjects ) in all treatment groups underwent low bleeding risk procedures , 17 . 2 % ( 70 / 430 ) of patients underwent procedures associated with moderate bleeding risk , and 22 . 1 % ( 90 / 430 ) of subjects underwent procedures associated with high bleeding risk .
The proportions of patients undergoing low , moderate , and high - risk procedures were similar between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups .
The major efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients who did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days following an elective procedure .
Additional secondary efficacy outcomes were the proportion of patients who achieved platelet counts of > 50 × 109 / L on the day of procedure , and the change in platelet count from baseline to procedure day .
Responders were defined as patients who did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days following a scheduled procedure .
The following were considered rescue therapies to manage the risk of bleeding associated with a procedure : whole blood transfusion , packed red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion , platelet transfusion , fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) or cryoprecipitate administration , Vitamin K , desmopressin , recombinant activated factor VII , aminocaproic acid , tranexamic acid , or surgical or interventional radiology procedures performed to achieve hemostasis and control blood loss .
In both baseline platelet count cohorts , patients in the DOPTELET treatment groups had a greater proportion of responders than the corresponding placebo treatment groups that was both clinically meaningful and statistically significant as detailed in Table 8 .

In addition , both trials demonstrated a higher proportion of patients who achieved the target platelet count of ≥ 50 × 109 / L on the day of procedure , a secondary efficacy endpoint , in both DOPTELET - treated groups versus the placebo - treated groups for both cohorts ( Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort – ADAPT - 1 : 69 % vs 4 % , respectively ; p ˂ 0 . 0001 , ADAPT - 2 : 67 % vs 7 % , respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 ; High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort – ADAPT - 1 : 88 % vs 21 % , respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 : ADAPT - 2 : 93 % vs 39 % , respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .
Further , both trials demonstrated a greater mean change in platelet counts from baseline to the day of the procedure , a secondary efficacy endpoint , in both DOPTELET - treated groups versus the placebo - treated groups for both cohorts ( Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort – ADAPT - 1 : 32 × 109 / L vs 0 . 8 × 109 / L , respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 ; ADAPT - 2 : 31 . 3 × 109 / L vs 3 . 0 × 109 / L , respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 ; High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort – ADAPT - 1 : 37 . 1 × 109 / L vs 1 . 0 × 109 / L , respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 ; ADAPT - 2 : 44 . 9 × 109 / L vs 5 . 9 × 109 / L , respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .
A measured increase in platelet counts was observed in both DOPTELET treatment groups over time beginning on Day 4 post - dose , that peaked on Day 10 - 13 , decreased 7 days post - procedure , and then returned to near baseline values by Day 35 .
14 . 2 Patients with Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia Randomized Phase 3 Clinical Trial The efficacy of DOPTELET in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia was evaluated in a Phase 3 , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( NCT01438840 ) .
Patients had previously received one or more prior chronic immune thrombocytopenia therapies and had an average of screening and baseline platelet counts < 30 × 109 / L .
Patients were centrally stratified by splenectomy status , baseline platelet count ( ≤ 15 × 109 / L or > 15 × 109 / L to < 30 × 109 / L ) , and use of concomitant chronic immune thrombocytopenia medication , and then randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to receive either DOPTELET or placebo for 6 months .
Patients received a starting dose of 20 mg once daily , with doses subsequently titrated based on platelet response .
Forty - nine patients were randomized , 32 to DOPTELET and 17 to placebo , with similar mean [ SD ] baseline platelet counts in the 2 treatment groups ( 14 . 1 [ 8 . 6 ] × 109 / L and 12 . 7 [ 7 . 8 ] × 109 / L , respectively ) .
The median age was 44 years , 63 % were female , and 94 % were Caucasian , 4 % Asian and 2 % Black .
The median duration of exposure was 26 weeks for DOPTELET - treated patients and 6 weeks for placebo - treated patients .
The major efficacy outcome in this trial was the cumulative number of weeks in which the platelet count was ≥ 50 × 109 / L during the 6 - month treatment period in the absence of rescue therapy .
DOPTELET - treated patients had a longer duration of platelet counts ≥ 50 × 109 / L in the absence of rescue therapy than those who received placebo ( median 12 . 4 [ 0 , 25 ] vs 0 [ 0 , 2 ] weeks , respectively , p < 0 . 0001 ) ( see Table 9 ) .
