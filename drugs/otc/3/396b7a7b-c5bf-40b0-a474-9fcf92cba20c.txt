6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The overall safety of EMEND was evaluated in approximately 6800 individuals .
Adults In 2 active - controlled , double - blind clinical trials in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy ( HEC ) ( Studies 1 and 2 ) , EMEND in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone ( EMEND regimen ) was compared to ondansetron and dexamethasone alone ( standard therapy ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
In 2 active - controlled clinical trials in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy ( MEC ) ( Studies 3 and 4 ) , EMEND in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone ( EMEND regimen ) was compared to ondansetron and dexamethasone alone ( standard therapy ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The most common adverse reaction reported in patients who received MEC in pooled Studies 3 and 4 was dyspepsia ( 6 % versus 4 % ) .
Across these 4 studies there were 1412 patients treated with the EMEND regimen during Cycle 1 of chemotherapy and 1099 of these patients continued into the Multiple - Cycle extension for up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy .
The most common adverse reactions reported in patients who received HEC and MEC in pooled Studies 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 are listed in Table 5 .
Table 5 : Most Common Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving HEC and MEC from a Pooled Analysis of HEC and MEC Studies [ 1 ] EMEND , ondansetron , and dexamethasone [ 2 ] ( N = 1412 ) Ondansetron and dexamethasone [ 3 ] ( N = 1396 ) fatigue 13 % 12 % diarrhea 9 % 8 % asthenia 7 % 6 % dyspepsia 7 % 5 % abdominal pain 6 % 5 % hiccups 5 % 3 % white blood cell count decreased 4 % 3 % dehydration 3 % 2 % alanine aminotransferase increased 3 % 2 % [ 1 ] Reported in ≥ 3 % of patients treated with the EMEND regimen and at a greater incidence than standard therapy .
[ 2 ] EMEND regimen [ 3 ] Standard therapy In a pooled analysis of the HEC and MEC studies , less common adverse reactions reported in patients treated with the EMEND regimen are listed in Table 6 .

In an additional active - controlled clinical study in 1169 patients receiving EMEND and HEC , the adverse reactions were generally similar to that seen in the other HEC studies with EMEND .
In another CINV study , Stevens - Johnson syndrome was reported as a serious adverse reaction in a patient receiving the EMEND regimen with cancer chemotherapy .
Adverse reactions in the Multiple - Cycle extensions of HEC and MEC studies for up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy were generally similar to that observed in Cycle 1 .
Pediatric Patients 6 Months to 17 Years of Age In a pooled analysis of 2 active - controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 17 years who received highly or moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy ( Study 5 and a safety study , Study 6 ) , EMEND in combination with ondansetron with or without dexamethasone ( EMEND regimen ) was compared to ondansetron with or without dexamethasone ( control regimen ) .
There were 184 patients treated with the EMEND regimen during Cycle 1 and 215 patients received open - label EMEND for up to 9 additional cycles of chemotherapy .
In Cycle 1 , the most common adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients treated with the EMEND regimen in pooled Studies 5 and 6 are listed in Table 7 .
Table 7 : Most Common Adverse Reactions in EMEND - Treated Pediatric Patients in HEC and MEC Pooled Studies 5 and 6 [ 1 ] EMEND and ondansetron [ 2 ] ( N = 184 ) Ondansetron [ 3 ] ( N = 168 ) neutropenia 13 % 11 % headache 9 % 5 % diarrhea 6 % 5 % decreased appetite 5 % 4 % cough 5 % 3 % fatigue 5 % 2 % hemoglobin decreased 5 % 4 % dizziness 5 % 1 % hiccups 4 % 1 % [ 1 ] Reported in ≥ 3 % of patients treated with the EMEND regimen and at a greater incidence than control regimen .
[ 2 ] EMEND regimen [ 3 ] Control regimen Forty - nine patients were treated with ifosfamide chemotherapy in each arm .
Two of the patients treated with ifosfamide in the aprepitant arm developed behavioral changes ( agitation = 1 ; abnormal behavior = 1 ) , whereas no patient treated with ifosfamide in the control arm developed behavioral changes .
Aprepitant has the potential for increasing ifosfamide - mediated neurotoxicity through induction of CYP3A4 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Non - CINV Studies Serious adverse reactions reported in adult patients receiving a non - recommended dosage of EMEND in non - CINV studies include single cases of each of the following : angioedema and urticaria , constipation , and sub - ileus .
EMEND is only approved in the CINV population .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of EMEND .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : pruritus , rash , urticaria , Stevens - Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis .
Immune system disorders : hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Nervous system disorders : ifosfamide - induced neurotoxicity reported after EMEND and ifosfamide coadministration .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Full Prescribing Information for a list of clinically significant drug interactions .
( 4 , 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 , 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs Aprepitant is a substrate , a weak - to - moderate ( dose - dependent ) inhibitor , and an inducer of CYP3A4 .
Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Aprepitant acts as a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 when administered as a 3 - day regimen ( 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg ) and can increase plasma concentrations of concomitant drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4 .
Some substrates of CYP3A4 are contraindicated with EMEND [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Dosage adjustment of some CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 substrates may be warranted , as shown in Table 8 .
Table 8 : Effects of Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other DrugsCYP3A4 Substrates Pimozide Clinical Impact Increased pimozide exposure .
Intervention EMEND is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Benzodiazepines Clinical Impact Increased exposure to midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 ( alprazolam , triazolam ) may increase the risk of adverse reactions [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention • Monitor for benzodiazepine - related adverse reactions .
• Depending on the clinical situation ( e . g . , elderly patients ) and degree of monitoring available , reduce the dose of intravenous midazolam Dexamethasone Clinical Impact Increased dexamethasone exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Reduce the dose of oral dexamethasone by approximately 50 % [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Methylprednisolone Clinical Impact Increased methylprednisolone exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention • Reduce the dose of intravenous methylprednisolone by approximately 25 % • Reduce the dose of oral methylprednisolone by approximately 50 % Chemotherapeutic agents that are metabolized by CYP3A4 Clinical Impact Increased exposure of the chemotherapeutic agent may increase the risk of adverse reactions [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Vinblastine , vincristine , or ifosfamide or other chemotherapeutic agents • Monitor for chemotherapeutic - related adverse reactions .
Etoposide , vinorelbine , paclitaxel , and docetaxel • No dosage adjustment needed .
Hormonal Contraceptives Clinical Impact Decreased hormonal exposure during administration of and for 28 days after administration of the last dose of EMEND [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Effective alternative or back - up methods of contraception ( such as condoms and spermicides ) should be used during treatment with EMEND and for 1 month following the last dose of EMEND .
Examples birth control pills , skin patches , implants , and certain IUDs CYP2C9 Substrates Warfarin Clinical Impact Decreased warfarin exposure and decreased prothrombin time ( INR ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention In patients on chronic warfarin therapy , monitor the prothrombin time ( INR ) in the 2 - week period , particularly at 7 to 10 days , following initiation of the 3 - day EMEND regimen with each chemotherapy cycle .
Other 5 - HT3 Antagonists Clinical Impact No change in the exposure of the 5 - HT3 antagonist [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention No dosage adjustment needed Examples ondansetron , granisetron , dolasetron 7 . 2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Aprepitant Aprepitant is a CYP3A4 substrate [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Co - administration of EMEND with drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may result in increased or decreased plasma concentrations of aprepitant , respectively , as shown in Table 9 .
Table 9 : Effects of Other Drugs on Pharmacokinetics of AprepitantModerate to Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Significantly increased exposure of aprepitant may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with EMEND [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Avoid concomitant use of EMEND .
Examples Moderate inhibitor : diltiazem Strong inhibitors : ketoconazole , itraconazole , nefazodone , troleandomycin , clarithromycin , ritonavir , nelfinavir Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact Substantially decreased exposure of aprepitant in patients chronically taking a strong CYP3A4 inducer may decrease the efficacy of EMEND [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Avoid concomitant use of EMEND .
Examples rifampin , carbamazepine , phenytoin 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient data on use of EMEND in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk .
In animal reproduction studies , no adverse developmental effects were observed in rats or rabbits exposed during the period of organogenesis to systemic drug levels ( AUC ) approximately 1 . 5 times the adult human exposure at the 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg EMEND regimen [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits , aprepitant was administered during the period of organogenesis at oral doses up to 1000 mg / kg twice daily in rats and up to the maximum tolerated dose of 25 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
No embryofetal lethality or malformations were observed at any dose level in either species .
The exposures ( AUC ) in pregnant rats at 1000 mg / kg twice daily and in pregnant rabbits at 125 mg / kg / day were approximately 1 . 5 times the adult exposure at the 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg EMEND regimen .
Aprepitant crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Lactation studies have not been conducted to assess the presence of aprepitant in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Aprepitant is present in rat milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for EMEND and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from EMEND or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Upon administration of EMEND , the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced .
Advise females of reproductive potential using hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative or back - up non - hormonal contraceptive ( such as condoms and spermicides ) during treatment with EMEND and for 1 month following the last dose [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of EMEND for oral suspension have been established in pediatric patients 6 months of age and older and EMEND capsules in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of HEC , including high - dose cisplatin , and MEC .
Use of EMEND in these age groups is supported by evidence from 302 pediatric patients in a randomized , double - blind , active comparator controlled clinical study ( n = 207 patients aged 6 months to less than 12 years , n = 95 patients aged 12 through 17 years ) .
EMEND was studied in combination with ondansetron with or without dexamethasone ( at the discretion of the physician ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Adverse reactions were similar to those reported in adult patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of EMEND for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with HEC or MEC have not been established in patients less than 6 months .
Juvenile Animal Study A study was conducted in young rats to evaluate the effects of aprepitant on growth and on neurobehavioral and sexual development .
Rats were treated at oral doses up to the maximum feasible dose of 1000 mg / kg twice daily ( providing exposure in male rats lower than the exposure at the recommended pediatric human dose and exposure in female rats equivalent to the pediatric human exposure ) from the early postnatal period ( Postnatal Day 10 ) through Postnatal Day 58 .
Slight changes in the onset of sexual maturation were observed in female and male rats ; however , there were no effects on mating , fertility , embryonic - fetal survival , or histomorphology of the reproductive organs .
There were no effects in neurobehavioral tests of sensory function , motor function , and learning and memory .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 544 adult cancer patients treated with EMEND in CINV clinical studies , 31 % were aged 65 and over , while 5 % were aged 75 and over .
Other reported clinical experience with EMEND has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients .
In general , use caution when dosing elderly patients as they have a greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function and concomitant disease or other drug therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of aprepitant in patients with severe renal impairment and those with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) requiring hemodialysis were similar to those of healthy subjects with normal renal function .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with any degree of renal impairment or for patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis .
8 . 7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of aprepitant in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those of healthy subjects with normal hepatic function .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score 5 to 9 ) .
There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score greater than 9 ) .
Therefore , additional monitoring for adverse reactions in these patients may be warranted when EMEND is administered [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage .
Drowsiness and headache were reported in one patient who ingested 1440 mg of EMEND ( approximately 11 times the maximum recommended single dose ) .
In the event of overdose , EMEND should be discontinued and general supportive treatment and monitoring should be provided .
Because of the antiemetic activity of EMEND , drug - induced emesis may not be effective in cases of EMEND overdosage .
Aprepitant is not removed by hemodialysis .
11 DESCRIPTION EMEND capsules contain the active ingredient , aprepitant .
Aprepitant is a substance P / neurokinin 1 ( NK1 ) receptor antagonist , an antiemetic agent , chemically described as 5 - [ [ ( 2 R , 3 S ) - 2 - [ ( 1 R ) - 1 - [ 3 , 5 - bis ( trifluoromethyl ) phenyl ] ethoxy ] - 3 - ( 4 - fluorophenyl ) - 4 - morpholinyl ] methyl ] - 1 , 2 - dihydro - 3 H - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazol - 3 - one .
Its empirical formula is C23H21F7N4O3 , and its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Aprepitant is a white to off - white crystalline solid , with a molecular weight of 534 . 43 .
It is practically insoluble in water .
Aprepitant is sparingly soluble in ethanol and isopropyl acetate and slightly soluble in acetonitrile .
Each capsule of EMEND for oral administration contains either 80 mg or 125 mg of aprepitant and the following inactive ingredients : sucrose , microcrystalline cellulose , hydroxypropyl cellulose and sodium lauryl sulfate .
The capsule shell excipients are gelatin , titanium dioxide , and may contain sodium lauryl sulfate and silicon dioxide .
The 125 - mg capsule also contains red ferric oxide and yellow ferric oxide .
Each pouch of EMEND for oral suspension 125 mg contains 125 mg of aprepitant and the following inactive ingredients : sucrose , lactose , hydroxypropyl cellulose , sodium lauryl sulfate , red iron oxide , and sodium stearyl fumarate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Aprepitant is a selective high - affinity antagonist of human substance P / neurokinin 1 ( NK1 ) receptors .
Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin ( 5 - HT3 ) , dopamine , and corticosteroid receptors , the targets of existing therapies for chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting ( CINV ) .
Aprepitant has been shown in animal models to inhibit emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents , such as cisplatin , via central actions .
Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) studies with aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK1 receptors .
Animal and human studies show that aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5 - HT3 - receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin - induced emesis .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics NK1 Receptor Occupancy In two single - blind , multiple - dose , randomized , and placebo - controlled studies , healthy young men received oral EMEND doses of 10 mg ( N = 2 ) , 30 mg ( N = 3 ) , 100 mg ( N = 3 ) or 300 mg ( N = 5 ) once daily ( 0 . 08 , 0 . 24 , 0 . 8 , and 2 . 4 times the maximum recommended single dose , respectively ) for 14 days with 2 or 3 subjects on placebo .
Both plasma aprepitant concentration and NK1 receptor occupancy in the corpus striatum by positron emission tomography were evaluated , at predose and 24 hours after the last dose .
At aprepitant plasma concentrations of approximately 10 ng / mL and 100 ng / mL , the NK1 receptor occupancies were approximately 50 % and 90 % , respectively .
The oral EMEND regimen produced mean trough plasma aprepitant concentrations greater than 500 ng / mL in adults , which would be expected to , based on the fitted curve with the Hill equation , result in greater than 95 % brain NK1 receptor occupancy .
However , the receptor occupancy has not been determined .
In addition , the relationship between NK1 receptor occupancy and the clinical efficacy of EMEND has not been established .
Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized , double - blind , positive - controlled , thorough QTc study , a single 200 - mg dose of fosaprepitant had no effect on the QTc interval .
Maximum aprepitant concentrations after a single 200 - mg dose of fosaprepitant were 4 - fold higher than that achieved with oral EMEND 125 mg .
QT prolongation with the recommended oral EMEND dosing regimens is not expected .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a single 125 - mg dose of EMEND on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3 , the AUC0 - 24 hr was approximately 19 . 6 mcg ∙ hr / mL and 21 . 2 mcg ∙ hr / mL on Day 1 and Day 3 , respectively .
The Cmax of 1 . 6 mcg / mL and 1 . 4 mcg / mL were reached in approximately 4 hours ( Tmax ) on Day 1 and Day 3 , respectively .
At the dose range of 80 to 125 mg , the mean absolute oral bioavailability of EMEND is approximately 60 to 65 % .
Oral administration of the capsule with a standard high - fat breakfast had no clinically meaningful effect on the bioavailability of aprepitant .
The pharmacokinetics of aprepitant were non - linear across the clinical dose range .
In healthy young adults , the increase in AUC0 - ∞ was 26 % greater than dose proportional between 80 - mg and 125 - mg single doses administered in the fed state .
Distribution Aprepitant is greater than 95 % bound to plasma proteins .
The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state ( Vdss ) was approximately 70 L in humans .
Aprepitant crosses the blood brain barrier in humans [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Elimination Metabolism Aprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism .
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 .
Metabolism is largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side chains .
No metabolism by CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , or CYP2E1 was detected .
In healthy young adults , aprepitant accounts for approximately 24 % of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single oral 300 - mg dose of [ 14 C ] - aprepitant ( 2 . 4 times the maximum EMEND recommended dose ) , indicating a substantial presence of metabolites in the plasma .
Seven metabolites of aprepitant , which are only weakly active , have been identified in human plasma .
Excretion Following administration of a single intravenous 100 - mg dose of [ 14 C ] - aprepitant prodrug to healthy subjects , 57 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 45 % in feces .
A study was not conducted with radiolabeled capsule formulation .
The results after oral administration may differ .
Aprepitant is eliminated primarily by metabolism ; aprepitant is not renally excreted .
The apparent plasma clearance of aprepitant ranged from approximately 62 to 90 mL / min .
The apparent terminal half - life ranged from approximately 9 to 13 hours .
Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following oral administration of a single 125 - mg dose of EMEND on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 through 5 ( 2 additional days of dosing compared to the recommended duration ) , the AUC0 - 24 hr of aprepitant was 21 % higher on Day 1 and 36 % higher on Day 5 in elderly ( 65 years and older ) relative to younger adults .
The Cmax was 10 % higher on Day 1 and 24 % higher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults .
These differences are not considered clinically meaningful [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients As part of a 3 - day regimen , dosing of aprepitant capsules ( 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg ) in 18 pediatric patients ( aged 12 through 17 years ) achieved a mean AUC0 - 24 hr of 17 mcg ∙ hr / mL on Day 1 with mean peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) at 1 . 3 mcg / mL occurring at approximately 4 hours .
The mean concentrations at the end of Day 2 ( N = 8 ) and Day 3 ( N = 16 ) were both at 0 . 6 mcg / mL As part of a 3 - day regimen , weight - based dosing of aprepitant powder for oral suspension ( 3 - mg / kg ; 2 - mg / kg ; 2 - mg / kg ) in 18 pediatric patients aged 6 months to less than 12 years achieved a mean AUC0 - 24 hr of 20 . 9 mcg ∙ hr / mL on Day 1 with mean peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) at 1 . 8 mcg / mL ( N = 19 ) , occurring at approximately 6 hours .
The mean concentrations at the end of Day 2 ( N = 18 ) and Day 3 ( N = 19 ) were 0 . 4 mcg / mL and 0 . 5 mcg / mL , respectively [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of aprepitant in pediatric patients ( aged 6 months through 17 years ) suggests that sex and race have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant .
Male and Female Patients Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg ( 3 times the maximum EMEND recommended dose ) , the AUC0 - 24 hr and Cmax are 9 % and 17 % higher in females as compared with males .
The half - life of aprepitant is approximately 25 % lower in females as compared with males and Tmax occurs at approximately the same time .
These differences are not considered clinically meaningful .
Racial or Ethnic Groups Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg ( 3 times the maximum EMEND recommended dose ) , the AUC0 - 24 hr and Cmax are approximately 27 % and 19 % higher in Hispanics as compared with Caucasians .
The AUC0 - 24 hr and Cmax were 74 % and 47 % higher in Asians as compared to Caucasians .
There was no difference in AUC0 - 24 hr or Cmax between Caucasians and Blacks .
These differences are not considered clinically meaningful .
Patients with Renal Impairment A single 240 - mg dose of aprepitant ( approximately 1 . 9 times the maximum EMEND recommended dose ) was administered to patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 as measured by 24 - hour urinary creatinine clearance ) and to patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) requiring hemodialysis .
In patients with severe renal impairment , the AUC0 - ∞ of total aprepitant ( unbound and protein bound ) decreased by 21 % and Cmax decreased by 32 % , relative to healthy subjects ( creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL / min estimated by Cockcroft - Gault method ) .
In patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis , the AUC0 - ∞ of total aprepitant decreased by 42 % and Cmax decreased by 32 % .
Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease , the AUC of pharmacologically active unbound drug was not significantly affected in patients with renal impairment compared with healthy subjects .
Hemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant ; less than 0 . 2 % of the dose was recovered in the dialysate [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following administration of a single 125 - mg dose of EMEND on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3 to patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score 5 to 6 ) , the AUC0 - 24 hr of aprepitant was 11 % lower on Day 1 and 36 % lower on Day 3 , as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen .
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score 7 to 9 ) , the AUC0 - 24 hr of aprepitant was 10 % higher on Day 1 and 18 % higher on Day 3 , as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen .
These differences in AUC0 - 24 hr are not considered clinically meaningful .
There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score greater than 9 ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Body Mass Index ( BMI ) For every 5 kg / m2 increase in BMI , AUC0 - 24 hr and Cmax of aprepitant decrease by 9 % and 10 % .
BMI of subjects in the analysis ranged from 18 kg / m2 to 36 kg / m2 .
This change is not considered clinically meaningful .
Drug Interactions Studies Aprepitant is a substrate , a moderate ( dose - dependent ) inhibitor , and an inducer of CYP3A4 .
Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9 .
Aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P - glycoprotein transporter .
Effects of Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs CYP3A4 substrates ( i . e . , midazolam ) : Interactions between EMEND and coadministered midazolam are listed in Table 10 ( increase is indicated as " ↑ " , decrease as " ↓ " , no change as " ↔ " ) .
Table 10 : Pharmacokinetic Interaction Data for EMEND and Coadministered MidazolamDosage of EMEND Dosage of Midazolam Observed Drug Interactions EMEND 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg on Days 2 to 5 oral 2 mg single dose on Days 1 and 5 midazolam AUC ↑ 2 . 3 - fold on Day 1 and ↑ 3 . 3 - fold on Day 5 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] EMEND 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg on Days 2 and 3 intravenous 2 mg prior to 3 - day regimen of EMEND and on Days 4 , 8 and 15 midazolam AUC ↑ 25 % on Day 4 , AUC ↓ 19 % on Day 8 and AUC ↓ 4 % on Day 15 EMEND 125 mg on Day 1 intravenous 2 mg given 1 hour after EMEND midazolam AUC ↑ 1 . 5 - fold A difference of less than 2 - fold increase of midazolam AUC is not considered clinically important .
Corticosteroids : Dexamethasone : EMEND , when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg / day on Days 2 through 5 , coadministered with 20 - mg dexamethasone on Day 1 and 8 - mg dexamethasone on Days 2 through 5 , increased the AUC of dexamethasone by 2 . 2 - fold on Days 1 and 5 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Methylprednisolone : EMEND , when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg / day on Days 2 and 3 , coadministered with 125 mg methylprednisolone IV on Day 1 and 40 mg methylprednisolone orally on Days 2 and 3 , increased the AUC of methylprednisolone by 1 . 34 - fold on Day 1 and by 2 . 5 - fold on Day 3 .
Chemotherapeutic agents : Docetaxel : In a pharmacokinetic study , EMEND ( 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg regimen ) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel .
Vinorelbine : In a pharmacokinetic study , EMEND ( 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg regimen ) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine to a clinically significant degree .
CYP2C9 substrates ( Warfarin , Tolbutamide ) : Warfarin : A single 125 - mg dose of EMEND was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg / day on Days 2 and 3 to healthy subjects who were stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy .
Although there was no effect of EMEND on the plasma AUC of R ( + ) or S ( - ) warfarin determined on Day 3 , there was a 34 % decrease in S ( - ) warfarin trough concentration accompanied by a 14 % decrease in the prothrombin time ( reported as International Normalized Ratio or INR ) 5 days after completion of dosing with EMEND [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Tolbutamide : EMEND , when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg / day on Days 2 and 3 , decreased the AUC of tolbutamide by 23 % on Day 4 , 28 % on Day 8 , and 15 % on Day 15 , when a single dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered prior to the administration of the 3 - day regimen of EMEND and on Days 4 , 8 , and 15 .
This effect was not considered clinically important .
Other Drugs Oral contraceptives : When EMEND was administered as a 3 - day regimen ( 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg ) with ondansetron and dexamethasone , and coadministered with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone , the trough concentrations of both ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone were reduced by as much as 64 % for 3 weeks post - treatment .
P - glycoprotein substrates : EMEND is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P - glycoprotein transporter , as demonstrated by the lack of interaction of EMEND with digoxin in a clinical drug interaction study .
5 - HT3 antagonists : In clinical drug interaction studies , aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron , granisetron , or hydrodolasetron ( the active metabolite of dolasetron ) .
Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Aprepitant Ketoconazole : When a single 125 - mg dose of EMEND was administered on Day 5 of a 10 - day regimen of 400 mg / day of ketoconazole , a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5 - fold and the mean terminal half - life of aprepitant increased approximately 3 - fold [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Rifampin : When a single 375 - mg dose of aprepitant ( 3 times the maximum EMEND recommended dose ) was administered on Day 9 of a 14 - day regimen of 600 mg / day of rifampin , a strong CYP3A4 inducer , the AUC of aprepitant decreased approximately 11 - fold and the mean terminal half - life decreased approximately 3 - fold [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Diltiazem : In patients with mild to moderate hypertension , administration of aprepitant once daily , as a tablet formulation comparable to 230 mg of the capsule formulation ( approximately 1 . 8 times the EMEND recommended dose ) , with diltiazem 120 mg 3 times daily for 5 days , resulted in a 2 - fold increase of aprepitant AUC and a simultaneous 1 . 7 - fold increase of diltiazem AUC .
These pharmacokinetic effects did not result in clinically meaningful changes in ECG , heart rate or blood pressure beyond those changes induced by diltiazem alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Paroxetine : Coadministration of once daily doses of aprepitant , as a tablet formulation comparable to 85 mg or 170 mg of the capsule formulation ( approximately 0 . 7 and 1 . 4 times the maximum EMEND recommended dose ) , with paroxetine 20 mg once daily , resulted in a decrease in AUC by approximately 25 % and Cmax by approximately 20 % of both aprepitant and paroxetine .
This effect was not considered clinically important .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in Sprague - Dawley rats and in CD - 1 mice for 2 years .
In the rat carcinogenicity studies , animals were treated with oral doses ranging from 0 . 05 to 1000 mg / kg twice daily .
The highest dose produced a systemic exposure to aprepitant ( AUC ) of 0 . 7 to 1 . 6 times the adult human exposure at the 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg EMEND regimen .
Treatment with aprepitant at doses of 5 to 1000 mg / kg twice daily caused an increase in the incidences of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in male rats .
In female rats , it produced hepatocellular adenomas at 5 to 1000 mg / kg twice daily and hepatocellular carcinomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas at 125 to 1000 mg / kg twice daily .
In the mouse carcinogenicity studies , the animals were treated with oral doses ranging from 2 . 5 to 2000 mg / kg / day .
The highest dose produced a systemic exposure of about 2 . 8 to 3 . 6 times the adult human exposure at the 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg EMEND regimen .
Treatment with aprepitant produced skin fibrosarcomas at 125 and 500 mg / kg / day doses in male mice .
Mutagenesis Aprepitant was not genotoxic in the Ames test , the human lymphoblastoid cell ( TK6 ) mutagenesis test , the rat hepatocyte DNA strand break test , the Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell chromosome aberration test and the mouse micronucleus test .
Impairment of Fertility Aprepitant did not affect the fertility or general reproductive performance of male or female rats at doses up to the maximum feasible dose of 1000 mg / kg twice daily ( providing exposure in male rats lower than the exposure at the recommended adult human dose and exposure in female rats at about 1 . 6 times the adult human exposure at the 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg EMEND regimen ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with HEC in Adults Oral administration of EMEND in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone ( EMEND regimen ) has been shown to prevent acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with HEC including high - dose cisplatin , and nausea and vomiting associated with MEC .
In Studies 1 and 2 , both multicenter , randomized , parallel , double - blind , controlled clinical studies in adults , EMEND in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone was compared with standard therapy ( ondansetron and dexamethasone alone ) in patients receiving a chemotherapy regimen that included cisplatin greater than 50 mg / m2 ( mean cisplatin dose = 80 . 2 mg / m2 ) .
See Table 11 .
In these studies , 95 % of the patients in the EMEND group received a concomitant chemotherapeutic agent in addition to protocol - mandated cisplatin .
The most common chemotherapeutic agents and the number of EMEND patients exposed follows : etoposide ( 106 ) , fluorouracil ( 100 ) , gemcitabine ( 89 ) , vinorelbine ( 82 ) , paclitaxel ( 52 ) , cyclophosphamide ( 50 ) , doxorubicin ( 38 ) , docetaxel ( 11 ) .
Of the 550 patients who were randomized to receive the EMEND regimen , 42 % were women , 58 % men , 59 % White , 3 % Asian , 5 % Black , 12 % Hispanic American , and 21 % Multi - Racial .
The EMEND - treated patients in these clinical studies ranged from 14 to 84 years of age , with a mean age of 56 years .
A total of 170 patients were 65 years or older , with 29 patients being 75 years or older .
Table 11 : HEC Treatment Regimens – Studies 1 and 2 [ 1 ] Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 CINV EMEND Regimen Oral EMEND [ 2 ] 125 mg 80 mg 80 mg none Oral Dexamethasone [ 3 ] 12 mg 8 mg 8 mg 8 mg Ondansetron 5 - HT3 antagonist [ 4 ] none none none CINV Standard Therapy Oral Dexamethasone 20 mg 8 mg twice daily 8 mg twice daily 8 mg twice daily Ondansetron 5 - HT3 antagonist null none none none [ 1 ] EMEND placebo and dexamethasone placebo were used to maintain blinding .
[ 2 ] EMEND was administered 1 hour prior to chemotherapy treatment on Day 1 and in the morning on Days 2 and 3 .
[ 3 ] Dexamethasone was administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy treatment on Day 1 and in the morning on Days 2 through 4 .
The 12 mg dose of dexamethasone on Day 1 reflects a dosage adjustment to account for a drug interaction with the EMEND regimen [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
[ 4 ] Ondansetron 32 mg intravenous was used in the clinical trials of EMEND .
Although this dose was used in clinical trials , this is no longer the currently recommended dose .
Refer to the ondansetron prescribing information for the current recommended dose .
The antiemetic activity of EMEND was evaluated during the acute phase ( 0 to 24 hours post - cisplatin treatment ) , the delayed phase ( 25 to 120 hours post - cisplatin treatment ) and overall ( 0 to 120 hours post - cisplatin treatment ) in Cycle 1 .
Efficacy was based on evaluation of the following endpoints in which emetic episodes included vomiting , retching , or dry heaves : Primary endpoint : • complete response ( defined as no emetic episodes and no use of rescue therapy as recorded in patient diaries ) Other prespecified endpoints : • complete protection ( defined as no emetic episodes , no use of rescue therapy , and a maximum nausea visual analogue scale [ VAS ] score less than 25 mm on a 0 to 100 mm scale ) • no emesis ( defined as no emetic episodes regardless of use of rescue therapy ) • no nausea ( maximum VAS less than 5 mm on a 0 to 100 mm scale ) • no significant nausea ( maximum VAS less than 25 mm on a 0 to 100 mm scale ) A summary of the key study results from each individual study analysis is shown in Table 12 .
In both studies , a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients receiving the EMEND regimen in Cycle 1 had a complete response in the overall phase ( primary endpoint ) , compared with patients receiving standard therapy .
A statistically significant difference in complete response in favor of the EMEND regimen was also observed when the acute phase and the delayed phase were analyzed separately .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Additional Patient - Reported Outcomes : The impact of nausea and vomiting on patients ' daily lives was assessed in Cycle 1 of both studies using the Functional Living Index – Emesis ( FLIE ) , a validated nausea - and vomiting - specific patient - reported outcome measure .
Minimal or no impact of nausea and vomiting on patients ' daily lives is defined as a FLIE total score greater than 108 .
In each of the 2 studies , a higher proportion of patients receiving the EMEND regimen reported minimal or no impact of nausea and vomiting on daily life ( Study 1 : 74 % versus 64 % ; Study 2 : 75 % versus 64 % ) .
Multiple - Cycle Extension : In the same 2 clinical studies , patients continued into the Multiple - Cycle extension for up to 5 additional cycles of chemotherapy .
The proportion of patients with no emesis and no significant nausea by treatment group at each cycle is depicted in Figure 2 .
Antiemetic effectiveness for the patients receiving the EMEND regimen was maintained throughout repeat cycles for those patients continuing in each of the multiple cycles .
Figure 2 : Proportion of Patients Receiving HEC with No Emesis and No Significant Nausea by Treatment Group and Cycle [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC in Adults EMEND was studied in two randomized , double - blind , parallel - group studies ( Studies 3 and 4 ) in adult patients receiving MEC .
In Study 3 , in breast cancer patients , EMEND in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone was compared with standard therapy ( ondansetron and dexamethasone ) in patients receiving a MEC regimen that included cyclophosphamide 750 - 1500 mg / m2 ; or cyclophosphamide 500 - 1500 mg / m2 and doxorubicin ( less than or equal to 60 mg / m2 ) or epirubicin ( less than or equal to 100 mg / m2 ) .
See Table 13 .
In this study , the most common combinations were cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin ( 61 % ) ; and cyclophosphamide + epirubicin + fluorouracil ( 22 % ) .
Of the 438 patients who were randomized to receive the EMEND regimen , 99 . 5 % were women .
Of these , approximately 80 % were White , 8 % Black , 8 % Asian , 4 % Hispanic , and less than 1 % Other .
The EMEND - treated patients in this clinical study ranged from 25 to 78 years of age , with a mean age of 53 years ; 70 patients were 65 years or older , with 12 patients being over 74 years .

[ 2 ] EMEND was administered 1 hour prior to chemotherapy treatment on Day 1 and in the mornings on Days 2 and 3 .
[ 3 ] Dexamethasone was administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy treatment on Day 1 .
The 12 mg dose of dexamethasone on Day 1 reflects a dosage adjustment to account for a drug interaction with the EMEND regimen [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
[ 4 ] The first ondansetron dose was administered 30 to 60 minutes prior to chemotherapy treatment on Day 1 and the second dose was administered 8 hours after first ondansetron dose .
The antiemetic activity of EMEND was evaluated based on the following endpoints in which emetic episodes included vomiting , retching , or dry heaves : Primary endpoint : • complete response ( defined as no emetic episodes and no use of rescue therapy as recorded in patient diaries ) in the overall phase ( 0 to 120 hours post - chemotherapy ) Other prespecified endpoints : • no emesis ( defined as no emetic episodes regardless of use of rescue therapy ) • no nausea ( maximum VAS less than 5 mm on a 0 to 100 mm scale ) • no significant nausea ( maximum VAS less than 25 mm on a 0 to 100 mm scale ) • complete protection ( defined as no emetic episodes , no use of rescue therapy , and a maximum nausea visual analogue scale [ VAS ] score less than 25 mm on a 0 to 100 mm scale ) • complete response during the acute and delayed phases .
A summary of the key results from Study 3 is shown in Table 14 .
In Study 3 , a statistically significantly ( p = 0 . 015 ) higher proportion of patients receiving the EMEND regimen ( 51 % ) in Cycle 1 had a complete response ( primary endpoint ) during the overall phase compared with patients receiving standard therapy ( 42 % ) .
The difference between treatment groups was primarily driven by the " No Emesis Endpoint " , a principal component of this composite primary endpoint .
In addition , a higher proportion of patients receiving the EMEND regimen in Cycle 1 had a complete response during the acute ( 0 - 24 hours ) and delayed ( 25 - 120 hours ) phases compared with patients receiving standard therapy ; however , the treatment group differences failed to reach statistical significance , after multiplicity adjustments .

Additional Patient - Reported Outcomes : In Study 3 , in patients receiving MEC , the impact of nausea and vomiting on patients ' daily lives was assessed in Cycle 1 using the FLIE .
A higher proportion of patients receiving the EMEND regimen reported minimal or no impact on daily life ( 64 % versus 56 % ) .
This difference between treatment groups was primarily driven by the " No Vomiting Domain " of this composite endpoint .
Multiple - Cycle Extension : In Study 3 , patients receiving MEC were permitted to continue into the Multiple - Cycle extension of the study for up to 3 additional cycles of chemotherapy .
The antiemetic effect for patients receiving the EMEND regimen was maintained during all cycles .
In Study 4 , EMEND in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone was compared with a standard therapy ( ondansetron and dexamethasone alone ) in patients receiving a MEC regimen that included any intravenous dose of oxaliplatin , carboplatin , epirubicin , idarubicin , ifosfamide , irinotecan , daunorubicin , doxorubicin ; cyclophosphamide intravenous ( less than 1500 mg / m2 ) ; or cytarabine intravenous ( greater than 1 g / m2 ) .
See Table 13 .
Patients receiving the EMEND regimen were receiving chemotherapy for a variety of tumor types including 50 % with breast cancer , 21 % with gastrointestinal cancers including colorectal cancer , 13 % with lung cancer and 6 % with gynecological cancers .
Of the 430 patients who were randomized to receive the EMEND regimen , 76 % were women and 24 % were men .
The distribution by race was 67 % White , 6 % Black or African American , 11 % Asian , and 12 % multiracial .
Classified by ethnicity , 36 % were Hispanic and 64 % were non - Hispanic .
The EMEND - treated patients in this clinical study ranged from 22 to 85 years of age , with a mean age of 57 years ; approximately 59 % of the patients were 55 years or older with 32 patients being over 74 years .
The antiemetic activity of EMEND was evaluated based on no vomiting ( with or without rescue therapy ) in the overall period ( 0 to 120 hours post - chemotherapy ) and complete response ( defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy ) in the overall period .
A summary of the key results from Study 4 is shown in Table 15 .
In Study 4 , a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients receiving the EMEND regimen ( 76 % ) in Cycle 1 had no vomiting during the overall phase compared with patients receiving standard therapy ( 62 % ) .
In addition , a higher proportion of patients receiving the EMEND regimen ( 69 % ) in Cycle 1 had a complete response in the overall phase ( 0 - 120 hours ) compared with patients receiving standard therapy ( 56 % ) .
In the acute phase ( 0 to 24 hours following initiation of chemotherapy ) , a higher proportion of patients receiving EMEND compared to patients receiving standard therapy were observed to have no vomiting ( 92 % and 84 % , respectively ) and complete response ( 89 % and 80 % , respectively ) .
In the delayed phase ( 25 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy ) , a higher proportion of patients receiving EMEND compared to patients receiving standard therapy were observed to have no vomiting ( 78 % and 67 % , respectively ) and complete response ( 71 % and 61 % , respectively ) .
In a subgroup analysis by tumor type , a numerically higher proportion of patients receiving EMEND were observed to have no vomiting and complete response compared to patients receiving standard therapy .
For sex , the difference in complete response rates between the EMEND and standard regimen groups was 14 % in females ( 64 . 5 % and 50 . 3 % , respectively ) and 4 % in males ( 82 . 2 % and 78 . 2 % , respectively ) during the overall phase .
A similar difference for sex was observed for the no vomiting endpoint .

14 . 3 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with HEC or MEC in Pediatric Patients In a randomized , double - blind , active comparator - controlled clinical study that included 302 pediatric patients aged 6 months to 17 years receiving HEC or MEC , EMEND in combination with ondansetron was compared to ondansetron alone ( control regimen ) for the prevention of CINV ( Study 5 ) .
Intravenous dexamethasone was permitted as part of the antiemetic regimen in both treatment groups , at the discretion of the physician .
A 50 % dose reduction of dexamethasone was required for patients in the EMEND group , reflecting a dosage adjustment to account for a drug interaction [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dexamethasone dose reduction was required for patients who received the control regimen .
Eligible patients had documented malignancy at either an original diagnosis or relapse and were scheduled to receive emetogenic chemotherapy or a chemotherapy regimen not previously tolerated due to vomiting along with ondansetron as part of their antiemetic regimen .
Of the 152 pediatric patients randomized to receive the EMEND regimen , 55 % were male , 45 % female , 78 % White , 7 % Asian , 0 % Black , 24 % Hispanic , and 13 % Multi - Racial .
The most common primary malignancies in subjects receiving the EMEND regimen were osteosarcoma ( 11 % ) , Ewing ' s sarcoma ( 11 % ) , neuroblastoma ( 9 % ) and rhabdomyosarcoma ( 8 % ) .
Other concomitant chemotherapy agents commonly administered and the number of EMEND patients exposed were : vincristine sulfate ( 65 ) , etoposide ( 59 ) , doxorubicin ( 48 ) , ifosfamide ( 45 ) , carboplatin ( 39 ) , and cisplatin ( 35 ) .
The treatment regimens in Study 5 for pediatric patients are defined in Table 16 .
Of the pediatric patients , 29 % in the EMEND regimen and 28 % in the control regimen used dexamethasone as part of the antiemetic regimen in Cycle 1 .

A 50 % dose reduction of dexamethasone was required for patients in the EMEND group , reflecting a dosage adjustment to account for a drug interaction [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dexamethasone dose reduction was required for patients in the control regimen .
[ 2 ] EMEND was administered 1 hour prior to chemotherapy treatment on Days 1 , 2 , and 3 .
If no chemotherapy was given on Days 2 and 3 , EMEND was administered in the morning .
[ 3 ] Ondansetron was administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy on Day 1 [ 4 ] EMEND placebo was used to maintain blinding .
The antiemetic activity of EMEND was evaluated over a 5 - day ( 120 hour ) period following the initiation of chemotherapy on Day 1 .
The primary endpoint in Study 5 was complete response in the delayed phase ( 25 to 120 hours following chemotherapy ) in Cycle 1 .
Patients had the opportunity to receive open - label EMEND in subsequent cycles ( Optional Cycles 2 - 6 ) ; however , efficacy was not assessed in these optional cycles .
Overall efficacy was based on the evaluation of the following endpoints : Primary endpoint : • complete response ( no vomiting , retching and no use of rescue medication ) in the delayed phase ( 25 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy ) Other prespecified endpoints : • complete response in the acute phase ( 0 to 24 hours following initiation of chemotherapy ) • complete response in the overall phase ( up to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy ) • no vomiting ( defined as no emesis , retching or dry heaves , regardless of use of rescue medication ) in the overall phase • safety and tolerability A summary of the key study results is shown in Table 17 .
