Serious hypersensitivity reaction to ixekizumab or to any of the excipients .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Infections : Serious infections have occurred .
Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur .
If a serious infection develops , discontinue TALTZ until the infection resolves .
( 5 . 1 ) • Tuberculosis ( TB ) : Evaluate for TB prior to initiating treatment .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypersensitivity : If a serious allergic reaction occurs , discontinue TALTZ immediately and initiate appropriate therapy .
( 5 . 3 ) • Inflammatory Bowel Disease : Crohn ' s disease and ulcerative colitis , including exacerbations , occurred during clinical trials .
Monitor closely when prescribing TALTZ to patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .
Discontinue TALTZ and initiate appropriate medical management if IBD develops .
( 5 . 4 ) • Immunizations : Avoid use of live vaccines .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Infections TALTZ may increase the risk of infection .
In clinical trials in adult patients with plaque psoriasis , the TALTZ group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group ( 27 % vs . 23 % ) .
Upper respiratory tract infections , oral candidiasis , conjunctivitis and tinea infections occurred more frequently in the TALTZ group than in the placebo group .
A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo - controlled trials in patients with pediatric psoriasis , psoriatic arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , and non - radiographic axial spondyloarthritis [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Instruct patients treated with TALTZ to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur .
If a patient develops a serious infection or is not responding to standard therapy , monitor the patient closely and discontinue TALTZ until the infection resolves .
5 . 2 Pre - treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis Evaluate patients for tuberculosis ( TB ) infection prior to initiating treatment with TALTZ .
Do not administer to patients with active TB infection .
Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering TALTZ .
Consider anti - TB therapy prior to initiating TALTZ in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed .
Patients receiving TALTZ should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment .
5 . 3 Hypersensitivity Serious hypersensitivity reactions , including angioedema and urticaria ( each ≤ 0 . 1 % ) , occurred in the TALTZ group in clinical trials .
Anaphylaxis , including cases leading to hospitalization , has been reported in post marketing use with TALTZ [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 , 6 . 3 ) ] .
If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs , discontinue TALTZ immediately and initiate appropriate therapy .
5 . 4 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients treated with TALTZ may be at increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease .
In clinical trials , Crohn ' s disease and ulcerative colitis , including exacerbations , occurred at a greater frequency in the TALTZ group than the placebo control group [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
During TALTZ treatment , monitor for onset or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease and if IBD occurs , discontinue TALTZ and initiate appropriate medical management .
5 . 5 Immunizations Prior to initiating therapy with TALTZ , consider completion of all age - appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines .
Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with TALTZ .
No data are available on the response to live vaccines .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying and controlled conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adult Plaque Psoriasis Weeks 0 to 12 : Three placebo - controlled trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis were integrated to evaluate the safety of TALTZ compared to placebo for up to 12 weeks .
A total of 1167 subjects ( mean age 45 years ; 66 % men ; 94 % White ) with plaque psoriasis received TALTZ ( 160 mg at Week 0 , 80 mg every 2 weeks [ Q2W ] for 12 weeks ) subcutaneously .
In two of the trials , the safety of TALTZ ( use up to 12 weeks ) was also compared with an active comparator , U . S . approved etanercept [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
In the 12 - week , placebo - controlled period , adverse events occurred in 58 % of the TALTZ Q2W group ( 2 . 5 per subject - year of follow - up ) compared with 47 % of the placebo group ( 2 . 1 per subject - year of follow - up ) .
Serious adverse events occurred in 2 % of the TALTZ group ( 0 . 07 per subject - year of follow - up ) , and in 2 % of the placebo group ( 0 . 07 per subject - year of follow - up ) .
Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1 % and at a higher rate in the TALTZ group than in the placebo group during the 12 - week placebo - controlled period of the pooled clinical trials .

Weeks 13 to 60 : A total of 332 subjects received the recommended maintenance regimen of TALTZ 80 mg dosed every 4 weeks .
During the maintenance period ( Weeks 13 to 60 ) , adverse events occurred in 80 % of subjects treated with TALTZ ( 1 . 0 per subject - year of follow - up ) compared to 58 % of subjects treated with placebo ( 1 . 1 per subject - year of follow - up ) .
Serious adverse events were reported in 4 % of subjects treated with TALTZ ( 0 . 05 per subject - year of follow - up ) and none in the subjects treated with placebo .
Weeks 0 to 60 : Over the entire treatment period ( Weeks 0 to 60 ) , adverse events were reported in 67 % of subjects treated with TALTZ ( 1 . 4 per subject - year of follow - up ) compared to 48 % of subjects treated with placebo ( 2 . 0 per subject - year of follow - up ) .
Serious adverse events were reported in 3 % of subjects treated with TALTZ ( 0 . 06 per subject - year of follow - up ) , and in 2 % of subjects treated with placebo ( 0 . 06 per subject - year of follow - up ) .
Specific Adverse Drug Reactions Injection Site Reactions The most frequent injection site reactions were erythema and pain .
Most injection site reactions were mild - to - moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of TALTZ .
Infections In the 12 - week , placebo - controlled period of the clinical trials in plaque psoriasis , infections occurred in 27 % of subjects treated with TALTZ ( 1 . 2 per subject - year of follow - up ) compared to 23 % of subjects treated with placebo ( 1 . 0 per subject - year of follow - up ) .
Serious infections occurred in 0 . 4 % of subjects treated with TALTZ ( 0 . 02 per subject - year of follow - up ) and in 0 . 4 % of subjects treated with placebo ( 0 . 02 per subject - year of follow - up ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
During the maintenance treatment period ( Weeks 13 to 60 ) , infections occurred in 57 % of subjects treated with TALTZ ( 0 . 70 per subject - year of follow - up ) compared to 32 % of subjects treated with placebo ( 0 . 61 per subject - year of follow - up ) .
Serious infections occurred in 0 . 9 % of subjects treated with TALTZ ( 0 . 01 per subject - year of follow - up ) and none in the subjects treated with placebo .
Over the entire treatment period ( Weeks 0 to 60 ) , infections were reported in 38 % of subjects treated with TALTZ ( 0 . 83 per subject - year of follow - up ) compared to 23 % of subjects treated with placebo ( 1 . 0 per subject - year of follow - up ) .
Serious infections occurred in 0 . 7 % of subjects treated with TALTZ ( 0 . 02 per subject - year of follow - up ) , and in 0 . 4 % of subject treated with placebo ( 0 . 02 per subject - year of follow - up ) .
Inflammatory Bowel Disease In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis , Crohn ' s disease and ulcerative colitis , including exacerbations , occurred at a greater frequency in the TALTZ 80 mg Q2W group ( Crohn ' s disease 0 . 1 % , ulcerative colitis 0 . 2 % ) than the placebo group ( 0 % ) during the 12 - week , placebo - controlled period in clinical trials [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Laboratory Assessment of Cytopenia Neutropenia Over the entire treatment period ( Weeks 0 to 60 ) , neutropenia occurred in 11 % of subjects treated with TALTZ ( 0 . 24 per subject - year of follow - up ) compared to 3 % of subjects treated with placebo ( 0 . 14 per subject - year of follow - up ) .
In subjects treated with TALTZ , the incidence rate of neutropenia during Weeks 13 to 60 was lower than the incidence rate during Weeks 0 to 12 .
In the 12 - week , placebo - controlled period , neutropenia ≥ Grade 3 ( < 1 , 000 cells / mm3 ) occurred in 0 . 2 % of the TALTZ group ( 0 . 007 per subject - year of follow - up ) compared to 0 . 1 % of the placebo group ( 0 . 006 per subject - year of follow - up ) .
The majority of cases of neutropenia were either Grade 2 ( 2 % for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W versus 0 . 3 % for placebo ; ≥ 1 , 000 to < 1 , 500 cells / mm3 ) or Grade 1 ( 7 % for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W versus 3 % for placebo ; ≥ 1 , 500 cells / mm3 to ˂ 2 , 000 cells / mm3 ) .
Neutropenia in the TALTZ group was not associated with an increased rate of infection compared to the placebo group .
Thrombocytopenia Ninety eight percent of cases of thrombocytopenia were Grade 1 ( 3 % for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W versus 1 % for placebo ; ≥ 75 , 000 cells / mm3 to < 150 , 000 cells / mm3 ) .
Thrombocytopenia in subjects treated with TALTZ was not associated with an increased rate of bleeding compared to subjects treated with placebo .
Active Comparator Trials In the two clinical trials that included an active comparator , the rate of serious adverse events during weeks zero to twelve was 0 . 7 % for U . S . approved etanercept and 2 % for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W , and the rate of discontinuation from adverse events was 0 . 7 % for U . S . approved etanercept and 2 % for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W .
The incidence of infections was 18 % for U . S . approved etanercept and 26 % for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W .
The rate of serious infections was 0 . 3 % for both TALTZ 80 mg Q2W and U . S . approved etanercept .
Pediatric Plaque Psoriasis TALTZ was evaluated in a placebo - controlled trial in pediatric subjects with moderate - to - severe psoriasis 6 to less than 18 years of age .
A total of 171 subjects were studied ( 115 subjects on TALTZ and 56 subjects on placebo ) .
Overall , the safety profile observed in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis treated with TALTZ every 4 weeks is consistent with the safety profile in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis with the exception of the frequencies of conjunctivitis ( 2 . 6 % ) , influenza ( 1 . 7 % ) , and urticaria ( 1 . 7 % ) .
In this clinical trial , Crohn ' s disease occurred at a greater frequency in the TALTZ group ( 0 . 9 % ) than the placebo group ( 0 % ) during the 12 - week , placebo - controlled period .
Crohn ' s disease occurred in a total of 4 TALTZ treated subjects ( 2 . 0 % ) in the clinical trial [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Psoriatic Arthritis TALTZ was studied in two placebo - controlled trials in patients with psoriatic arthritis .
A total of 678 patients were studied ( 454 patients on TALTZ and 224 on placebo ) .
A total of 229 patients in these trials received TALTZ 160 mg at Week 0 , followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks ( Q4W ) .
Overall , the safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with TALTZ Q4W is consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis with the exception of the frequencies of influenza ( 1 . 3 % ) and conjunctivitis ( 1 . 3 % ) .
Ankylosing Spondylitis TALTZ was studied in two placebo - controlled trials in patients with ankylosing spondylitis .
A total of 566 patients were studied ( 376 patients on TALTZ and 190 on placebo ) .
A total of 195 patients in these trials received TALTZ 80 or 160 mg at Week 0 , followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks ( Q4W ) .
Overall , the safety profile observed in patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with TALTZ Q4W is consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis .
In adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis , Crohn ' s disease and ulcerative colitis , including exacerbations , occurred in 2 patients ( 1 . 0 % ) and 1 patient ( 0 . 5 % ) , respectively , in the TALTZ 80 mg Q4W group and 1 patient ( 0 . 5 % ) and 0 % , respectively , in the placebo group during the 16 - week , placebo - controlled period in clinical trials .
Of these patients , serious events occurred in 1 patient in the TALTZ 80 mg Q4W group and 1 patient in the placebo group [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Non - radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis TALTZ was studied in a placebo - controlled trial in patients with non - radiographic axial spondyloarthritis .
A total of 303 patients were studied ( 198 patients on TALTZ and 105 on placebo ) .
A total of 96 patients in this trial received TALTZ 80 or 160 mg at Week 0 , followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks ( Q4W ) .
Overall , the safety profile observed in patients with non - radiographic axial spondyloarthritis treated with TALTZ 80 mg Q4W up to Week 16 is consistent with the previous experience of TALTZ in other indications .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins there is the potential for immunogenicity with TALTZ .
The assay to test for neutralizing antibodies has limitations detecting neutralizing antibodies in the presence of ixekizumab ; therefore , the incidence of neutralizing antibodies development could be underestimated .
Plaque Psoriasis Population By Week 12 , approximately 9 % of adult subjects treated with TALTZ every 2 weeks developed antibodies to ixekizumab .
Approximately 22 % of subjects treated with TALTZ at the recommended dosing regimen developed antibodies to ixekizumab during the 60 - week treatment period .
The clinical effects of antibodies to ixekizumab are dependent on the antibody titer ; higher antibody titers were associated with decreasing drug concentration and clinical response .
Of the adult subjects who developed antibodies to ixekizumab during the 60 - week treatment period , approximately 10 % , which equates to 2 % of subjects treated with TALTZ at the recommended dosing regimen , had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing .
Neutralizing antibodies were associated with reduced drug concentrations and loss of efficacy .
In pediatric psoriasis subjects treated with ixekizumab at the recommended dosing regimen up to 12 weeks , 21 subjects ( 18 % ) developed anti - drug antibodies , 5 subjects ( 4 % ) had confirmed neutralizing antibodies associated with low drug concentrations .
No conclusive evidence could be obtained on the potential association of neutralizing antibodies and clinical response and / or adverse events due to small number of pediatric subjects in the study .
Psoriatic Arthritis Population For subjects treated with TALTZ 80 mg every 4 weeks for up to 52 weeks ( PsA1 ) , 11 % developed anti - drug antibodies , and 8 % had confirmed neutralizing antibodies .
Ankylosing Spondylitis Population For patients treated with TALTZ 80 mg every 4 weeks for up to 16 weeks ( AS1 , AS2 ) , 5 . 2 % developed anti - drug antibodies , and 1 . 5 % had neutralizing antibodies .
Non - radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis Population Of patients treated with TALTZ 80 mg every 4 weeks for up to 52 weeks ( nr - axSpA1 ) , 8 . 9 % developed anti - drug antibodies , all of which were low titer .
No patient had neutralizing antibodies .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of incidence of antibodies to TALTZ across indications or with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of TALTZ .
Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to TALTZ exposure .
Immune system disorders : anaphylaxis [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Infections : esophageal candidiasis 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to TALTZ during pregnancy .
Pregnant women exposed to TALTZ are encouraged to enroll in the TALTZ Pregnancy Registry by calling 1 - 800 - 284 - 1695 .
Contact information for the registry is also available on https : / / www . taltz . com .
Risk Summary Available data from the published literature and the pharmacovigilance database with TALTZ use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Human IgG is known to cross the placental barrier ; therefore , TALTZ may be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus .
An embryofetal development study conducted in pregnant monkeys during organogenesis at doses up to 19 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) revealed no evidence of harm to the developing fetus .
When dosing was continued until parturition , neonatal deaths were observed at 1 . 9 times the MRHD [ see Data ] .
The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is unknown .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data An embryofetal development study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys administered ixekizumab .
No malformations or embryofetal toxicity were observed in fetuses from pregnant monkeys administered ixekizumab weekly by subcutaneous injection during organogenesis to near parturition at doses up to 19 times the MRHD ( on a mg / kg basis of 50 mg / kg / week ) .
Ixekizumab crossed the placenta in monkeys .
In a pre - and post - natal development toxicity study , pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered weekly subcutaneous doses of ixekizumab up to 19 times the MRHD from the beginning of organogenesis to parturition .
Neonatal deaths occurred in the offspring of two monkeys administered ixekizumab at 1 . 9 times the MRHD ( on a mg / kg basis of 5 mg / kg / week ) and two monkeys administered ixekizumab at 19 times the MRHD ( on a mg / kg basis of 50 mg / kg / week ) .
These neonatal deaths were attributed to early delivery , trauma , or congenital defect .
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown .
No ixekizumab - related effects on functional or immunological development were observed in the surviving infants from birth through 6 months of age .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of ixekizumab in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Ixekizumab was detected in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for TALTZ and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from TALTZ or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TALTZ have been established in pediatric subjects aged 6 years to less than 18 years with moderate - to - severe plaque psoriasis .
The safety and effectiveness of TALTZ in other pediatric indications and for pediatric subjects less than 6 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 4204 adult psoriasis subjects exposed to TALTZ , a total of 301 were 65 years or older , and 36 subjects were 75 years or older .
Although no differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger subjects , the number of subjects aged 65 and over is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

Sodium Hydroxide , USP - NF , may have been added to adjust pH . The TALTZ solution has a pH of 5 . 2 – 6 . 2 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ixekizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with the interleukin 17 A ( IL - 17 A ) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL - 17 receptor .
IL - 17 A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses .
Ixekizumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics No formal pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with TALTZ .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic ( PK ) properties of ixekizumab were similar across the adult plaque psoriasis , psoriatic arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , and non - radiographic axial spondyloarthritis indications .
Absorption Following a single subcutaneous dose of 160 mg in subjects with plaque psoriasis , ixekizumab reached peak mean ( ± SD ) serum concentrations ( Cmax ) of 16 . 2 ± 6 . 6 mcg / mL by approximately 4 days post dose .
Steady - state concentrations were achieved by Week 8 following the 160 mg starting dose and 80 mg every 2 weeks dosing regimen ; the mean ± SD steady - state trough concentration was 9 . 3 ± 5 . 3 mcg / mL .
Steady - state concentrations were achieved approximately 10 weeks after switching from the 80 mg every 2 weeks dosing regimen to the 80 mg every 4 weeks dosing regimen at Week 12 .
The mean ± SD steady - state trough concentration was 3 . 5 ± 2 . 5 mcg / mL .
In studies of subjects with plaque psoriasis , ixekizumab bioavailability ranged from 60 % to 81 % following subcutaneous injection .
Administration of ixekizumab via injection in the thigh achieved a higher bioavailability relative to that achieved using other injection sites including the arm and abdomen .
Distribution The mean ( geometric CV % ) volume of distribution at steady - state was 7 . 11 L ( 29 % ) in subjects with plaque psoriasis .
Elimination The metabolic pathway of ixekizumab has not been characterized .
As a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody ixekizumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG .
The mean systemic clearance was 0 . 39 L / day ( 37 % ) and the mean ( geometric CV % ) half - life was 13 days ( 40 % ) in subjects with plaque psoriasis .
Weight Ixekizumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases .
Dose Linearity Ixekizumab exhibited dose - proportional pharmacokinetics in subjects with plaque psoriasis over a dose range from 5 mg ( not the recommended dose ) to 160 mg following subcutaneous administration .
Specific Populations Age : Geriatric Population Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age did not significantly influence the clearance of ixekizumab in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis .
Subjects who are 65 years or older had a similar ixekizumab clearance as compared to subjects less than 65 years old .
Pediatric Population Pediatric psoriasis subjects ( 6 to less than 18 years of age ) were administered ixekizumab at the recommended pediatric dosing regimen for 12 weeks .
Subjects weighing > 50 kg and 25 to 50 kg had a mean ± SD steady - state trough concentration of 3 . 8 ± 2 . 2 mcg / mL and 3 . 9 ± 2 . 4 mcg / mL at Week 12 , respectively .
There were limited PK data ( n = 2 ) in subjects weighing < 25 kg at Week 12 .
Drug Interaction Studies Population PK data analyses indicated that the clearance of ixekizumab was not impacted by concomitant administration of methotrexate , or by prior exposure to methotrexate or adalimumab in patients with psoriatic arthritis .
Population PK data analyses indicated that the clearance of ixekizumab was not impacted by concomitant administration of oral corticosteroids , NSAIDs , or cDMARDs ( sulfasalazine and methotrexate ) in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and non - radiographic axial spondyloarthritis .
Cytochrome P450 Substrates No clinically significant changes in exposure of caffeine ( CYP1A2 substrate ) , warfarin ( CYP2C9 substrate ) , omeprazole ( CYP2C19 substrate ) or midazolam ( CYP3A substrate ) were observed in subjects with plaque psoriasis when used concomitantly with a single 160 mg dose of ixekizumab , or multiple doses of 80 mg every 2 weeks .
The potential effect of ixekizumab on the CYP2D6 activity cannot be ruled out due to high variability in exposure ( approximately ± 2 - fold ) of dextromethorphan and its CYP2D6 metabolite dextrorphan in psoriasis subjects .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of TALTZ .
Moreover published literature is mixed on potential effects on malignancy risk due to the inhibition of IL - 17 A activity , the pharmacological action of TALTZ .
Some published literature suggests that IL - 17 A directly promotes cancer cell invasion , suggesting a potential beneficial effect by TALTZ , whereas other reports indicate IL - 17 A promotes T - cell mediated tumor rejection , suggesting a potential adverse effect by TALTZ .
However , neutralization of IL - 17 A with TALTZ has not been studied in these models .
Depletion of IL - 17 A with a neutralizing antibody inhibited tumor development in mice , suggesting a potential beneficial effect by TALTZ .
The relevance of experimental findings in mouse models for malignancy risk in humans is unknown .
No effects on fertility parameters such as reproductive organs , menstrual cycle length , or sperm analysis were observed in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys that were administered ixekizumab for 13 weeks at a subcutaneous dose of 50 mg / kg / week ( 19 times the MRHD on a mg / kg basis ) .
The monkeys were not mated to evaluate fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Adult Plaque Psoriasis Three multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials , Trials 1 , 2 , and 3 ( NCT 01474512 , NCT 01597245 , NCT 01646177 ) , enrolled a total of 3866 subjects 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis who had a minimum body surface area involvement of 10 % , a static Physician Global Assessment ( sPGA ) score of ≥ 3 in the overall assessment ( plaque thickness / induration , erythema , and scaling ) of psoriasis on a severity scale of 0 to 5 , a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI ) score ≥ 12 , and who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy .
In all three trials , subjects were randomized to either placebo or TALTZ ( 80 mg every 2 weeks [ Q2W ] ) for 12 weeks , following a 160 mg starting dose .
In the two active comparator trials ( Trials 2 and 3 ) , subjects were also randomized to receive U . S . approved etanercept 50 mg twice weekly for 12 weeks .
All three trials assessed the changes from baseline to Week 12 in the two co - primary endpoints : 1 ) PASI 75 , the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75 % reduction in the PASI composite score that takes into consideration both the percentage of body surface area affected and the nature and severity of psoriatic changes ( induration , erythema and scaling ) within the affected regions , and 2 ) sPGA of “ 0 ” ( clear ) or “ 1 ” ( minimal ) , the proportion of subjects with an sPGA 0 or 1 and at least a 2 - point improvement .
Other evaluated outcomes included the proportion of subjects with an sPGA score of 0 ( clear ) , a reduction of at least 90 % in PASI ( PASI 90 ) , a reduction of 100 % in PASI ( PASI 100 ) , and an improvement of itch severity as measured by a reduction of at least 4 points on an 11 - point itch Numeric Rating Scale .
Subjects in all treatment groups had a median baseline PASI score ranging from approximately 17 to 18 .
Baseline sPGA score was severe or very severe in 51 % of subjects in Trial 1 , 50 % in Trial 2 , and 48 % in Trial 3 .
Of all subjects , 44 % had received prior phototherapy , 49 % had received prior conventional systemic therapy , and 26 % had received prior biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis .
Of the subjects who had received prior biologic therapy , 15 % had received at least one anti - TNF alpha agent , and 9 % had received an anti - IL 12 / IL23 .
A total of 23 % of study subjects had a history of psoriatic arthritis .
Clinical Response at Week 12 The results of Trials 1 , 2 , and 3 are presented in Table 3 .

d Itch NRS ( ≥ 4 improvement ) in subjects with baseline Itch NRS ≥ 4 .
The number of ITT subjects with baseline Itch NRS Score ≥ 4 are as follows : Trial 1 , TALTZ n = 391 , PBO n = 374 ; Trial 2 , TALTZ n = 303 , PBO n = 135 ; Trial 3 , TALTZ n = 320 , PBO n = 158 .

An integrated analysis of the U . S . sites in the two active comparator studies using U . S . approved etanercept , TALTZ demonstrated superiority to U . S . approved etanercept ( 50 mg twice weekly ) on sPGA and PASI scores during the 12 - week treatment period .
The respective response rates for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W and U . S . approved etanercept 50 mg twice weekly were : sPGA of 0 or 1 ( 73 % and 27 % ) ; PASI 75 ( 87 % and 41 % ) ; sPGA of 0 ( 34 % and 5 % ) ; PASI 90 ( 64 % and 18 % ) , and PASI 100 ( 34 % and 4 % ) .
Maintenance and Durability of Response To evaluate the maintenance and durability of response , subjects originally randomized to TALTZ and who were responders at Week 12 ( i . e . , sPGA of 0 or 1 ) in Trial 1 and Trial 2 were re - randomized to an additional 48 weeks of either a maintenance dose of TALTZ 80 mg Q4W ( every 4 weeks ) or placebo .
Non - responders ( sPGA > 1 ) at Week 12 and subjects who relapsed ( sPGA ≥ 3 ) during the maintenance period were placed on TALTZ 80 mg Q4W .
For responders at Week 12 , the percentage of subjects who maintained this response ( sPGA 0 or 1 ) at Week 60 ( 48 weeks following re - randomization ) in the integrated trials ( Trial 1 and Trial 2 ) was higher for subjects treated with TALTZ 80 mg Q4W ( 75 % ) compared to those treated with placebo ( 7 % ) .
For responders at Week 12 who were re - randomized to treatment withdrawal ( i . e . , placebo ) , the median time to relapse ( sPGA ≥ 3 ) was 164 days in the integrated trials .
Among these subjects , 66 % regained a response of at least 0 or 1 on the sPGA within 12 weeks of restarting treatment with TALTZ 80 mg Q4W .
Psoriasis Involving the Genital Area A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( Trial 4 ) was conducted in 149 adult subjects with plaque psoriasis who had a minimum body surface area ( BSA ) involvement of 1 % , a sPGA score of ≥ 3 ( moderate psoriasis ) , a sPGA of Genitalia score of ≥ 3 ( moderate psoriasis involving the genital area ) , who failed to respond to or were intolerant of at least one topical therapy used for treatment of psoriasis affecting the genital area , and who were candidates for phototherapy and / or systemic therapy .
Subjects had a median baseline PASI score of approximately 12 .
Baseline BSA involvement was at least 10 % for approximately 60 % of the enrolled subjects .
Baseline sPGA of Genitalia score was severe or very severe in approximately 42 % of the subjects ; baseline sPGA score was severe or very severe in approximately 47 % of the subjects .
Subjects randomized to TALTZ received an initial dose of 160 mg followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks .
The trial evaluated the primary endpoint of the proportion of subjects who achieved a “ 0 ” ( clear ) or “ 1 ” ( minimal ) response at Week 12 on sPGA of Genitalia .
Other evaluated outcomes at Week 12 included the proportion of subjects who achieved a sPGA score of “ 0 ” ( clear ) or “ 1 ” ( minimal ) , improvement of genital itch severity as measured by a reduction of at least 4 points in the 11 - point Genital Psoriasis Symptoms Scale ( GPSS ) score Itch numeric rating scale ( NRS ) , and the patient - perceived impact of psoriasis affecting the genital area on limiting frequency of sexual activity ( intercourse or other activities ) as measured by the Genital Psoriasis Sexual Frequency Questionnaire ( GenPs - SFQ ) Item 2 ( In the past week how often did your genital psoriasis limit the frequency of your sexual activity ? )
.
SFQ Item 2 score ranges from 0 to 4 ( 0 = never , 1 = rarely , 2 = sometimes , 3 = often , 4 = always ) ; where higher scores indicate greater limitations on the frequency of sexual activity in the past week .
The results of Trial 4 are presented in Table 4 .

Patients in these studies had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months across both studies .
At baseline , 60 % and 23 % of the patients had enthesitis and dactylitis , respectively .
In PsA2 , all patients discontinued previous treatment with anti - TNFα agents due to either inadequate response or intolerance .
In addition , approximately 47 % of patients from both studies had concomitant methotrexate ( MTX ) use .
PsA1 Study ( NCT 01695239 ) evaluated 417 biologic - naive patients , who were treated with either TALTZ 160 mg at Week 0 followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks ( Q2W ) or 4 weeks ( Q4W ) , adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks , or placebo .
PsA2 Study ( NCT 02349295 ) evaluated 363 anti - TNFα experienced patients , who were treated with TALTZ 160 mg at Week 0 followed by 80 mg every 2 or 4 weeks , or placebo .
Patients receiving placebo were re - randomized to receive TALTZ ( 80 mg every 2 or 4 weeks ) at Week 16 or Week 24 based on responder status .
The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an ACR20 response at Week 24 .
Clinical Response In both studies , patients treated with TALTZ 80 mg Q4W demonstrated a greater clinical response including ACR20 , ACR50 , and ACR70 compared to placebo at Week 24 ( Table 6 ) .
In PsA2 , responses were seen regardless of prior anti - TNFα exposure .

Treatment with TALTZ 80 mg Q4W resulted in an improvement in psoriatic skin lesions in patients with PsA .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Radiographic Response Radiographic changes were assessed in PsA1 .
Inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as the change in modified total Sharp score ( mTSS ) at Week 16 , compared to baseline .
The total Sharp score was modified for psoriatic arthritis by addition of hand distal interphalangeal ( DIP ) joints .
TALTZ 80 mg Q4W inhibited the progression of structural joint damage ( mTSS ) compared to placebo at Week 16 .
The adjusted mean change from baseline in the mTSS was 0 . 13 for TALTZ 80 mg Q4W and 0 . 36 for placebo ( difference in means TALTZ minus placebo : - 0 . 23 , 95 % CI : ( - 0 . 42 , - 0 . 04 ) ) .
Physical Function TALTZ treated patients showed improvement in physical function compared to patients treated with placebo as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index ( HAQ - DI ) at Week 12 and 24 .
In both studies , the proportion of HAQ - DI responders ( ≥ 0 . 35 improvement in HAQ - DI score ) was greater in the TALTZ 80 mg Q4W groups compared to placebo at week 12 and 24 .
Other Health - Related Outcomes General health status was assessed by the Short Form health survey ( SF - 36 ) .
At Week 12 in PsA1 and PsA2 , patients treated with TALTZ showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF - 36 physical component summary ( PCS ) score compared to patients treated with placebo but this improvement was not consistent in both studies for the SF - 36 mental component summary ( MCS ) score .
At Week 12 , there was consistent evidence of effect in the physical - functioning , role - physical , bodily - pain , and general health domains but not in the social - functioning , role - emotional , vitality , and mental health domains .
14 . 4 Ankylosing Spondylitis The safety and efficacy of TALTZ were assessed in 567 patients , in 2 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies ( AS1 and AS2 ) in adult patients , age 18 years and older with active ankylosing spondylitis .
Patients had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index ( BASDAI ) ≥ 4 despite non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) , corticosteroid , or disease modifying anti - rheumatic drug ( DMARD ) therapy .
At baseline , patients had symptoms of AS for an average of 17 years across both studies .
At baseline , approximately 32 % of the patients were on a concomitant cDMARD .
In AS2 , all patients discontinued previous treatment with 1 or 2 TNF inhibitors due to either inadequate response or intolerance .
AS1 Study ( NCT 02696785 ) evaluated 341 biologic - naive patients , who were treated with either TALTZ 80 mg or 160 mg at Week 0 followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks ( Q2W ) or 4 weeks ( Q4W ) , adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks , or with placebo .
Patients receiving placebo were re - randomized at Week 16 to receive TALTZ ( 160 mg starting dose , followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W ) .
Patients receiving adalimumab were re - randomized at Week 16 to receive TALTZ ( 80 mg Q2W or Q4W ) .
AS2 Study ( NCT 02696798 ) evaluated 316 TNF - inhibitor experienced patients ( 90 % were inadequate responders and 10 % were intolerant to TNF inhibitors ) .
All patients were treated with TALTZ 80 or 160 mg at Week 0 followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W , or with placebo .
Patients receiving placebo were re - randomized at Week 16 to receive TALTZ ( 160 mg initial dose , followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W ) .
The primary endpoint in both studies was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 ( ASAS40 ) response at Week 16 .
Clinical Response In both studies , patients treated with TALTZ 80 mg Q4W demonstrated greater improvements in ASAS40 and ASAS20 responses compared to placebo at Week 16 ( Table 8 ) .
