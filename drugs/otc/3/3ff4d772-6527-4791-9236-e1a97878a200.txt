Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure when replacing fluids .
If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration including signs of orthostatic hypotension after taking GaviLyte - N , consider performing post - colonoscopy lab tests ( electrolytes , creatinine , and BUN ) and treat accordingly .
Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias , seizures and renal impairment .
Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected before treatment with GaviLyte - N .
In addition , use caution when prescribing GaviLyte - N for patients who have conditions , or who are using medications , that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure , arrhythmias , and renal impairment [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] 5 . 2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation .
Use caution when prescribing GaviLyte - N for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias ( e . g . , patients with a history of prolonged QT , uncontrolled arrhythmias , recent myocardial infarction , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , or cardiomyopathy ) .
Pre - dose and post - colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias .
5 . 3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic - clonic seizures and / or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures .
The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities ( e . g . , hyponatremia , hypokalemia , hypocalcemia , and hypomagnesemia ) and low serum osmolality .
The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities .
Use caution when prescribing GaviLyte - N for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure , such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold ( e . g . , tricyclic antidepressants ) , patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines , or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia .
5 . 4 Renal Impairment Use caution when prescribing GaviLyte - N for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function ( such as diuretics , angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers , or non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ) .
Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration , and consider performing baseline and post - colonoscopy laboratory tests ( electrolytes , creatinine , and BUN ) in these patients .
5 . 5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations , and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization .
Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and GaviLyte - N may increase this risk .
The potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .
5 . 6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected , perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering GaviLyte - N .
If a patient experiences severe bloating , distention or abdominal pain , administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate .
If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected , appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of GaviLyte - N .
Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis .
5 . 7 Aspiration Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex , unconscious , or semiconscious patients , and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration .
Such patients should be observed during administration of GaviLyte - N , especially if it administered via nasogastric tube .
5 . 8 Not for Direct Ingestion The contents of each jug must be diluted with water to a final volume of 4 liters ( 4 L ) and ingestion of additional water is important to patient tolerance .
Direct ingestion of the undissolved powder may increase the risk of nausea , vomiting , dehydration , and electrolyte disturbances .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 3 % ) are : nausea , abdominal fullness and bloating .
Abdominal cramps , vomiting and anal irritation occur less frequently ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals , Inc . at 1 - 866 - 403 - 7592 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of GaviLyte - N .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Nausea , abdominal fullness and bloating are the most common adverse reactions ( occurred in up to 50 % of patients ) to administration of GaviLyte - N .
Abdominal cramps , vomiting and anal irritation occur less frequently .
These adverse reactions are transient and usually subside rapidly .
Isolated cases of urticaria , rhinorrhea , dermatitis and ( rarely ) anaphylactic reaction have been reported which may represent allergic reactions .
Published literature contains isolated reports of serious adverse reactions following the administration of PEG - electrolyte solution products in patients over 60 years of age .
These adverse events include upper GI bleeding from Mallory - Weiss Tear , esophageal perforation , asystole , sudden dyspnea with pulmonary edema , and " butterfly - like " infiltrates on chest X - ray after vomiting and aspirating PEG .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Some drugs increase risks due to fluid and electrolyte changes ( 7 . 1 ) • Oral medication taken within 1 hour of start of each dose may not be absorbed properly ( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Drugs that May Lead to Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Use caution when prescribing GaviLyte - N for patients who are using medications that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure , arrhythmias , and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities .
Consider additional patient evaluations as appropriate [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 , and 5 . 4 ) ] in patients taking these concomitant medications .
7 . 2 Potential for Altered Drug Absorption Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of administration of GaviLyte - N may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract and the medication may not be absorbed properly .
7 . 3 Stimulant Laxatives Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and GaviLyte - N may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis .
Avoid use of stimulant laxatives ( e . g . , bisacodyl , sodium picosulfate ) while taking GaviLyte - N .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with GaviLyte - N .
It is also not known whether GaviLyte - N can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity .
GaviLyte - N should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when GaviLyte - N is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of GaviLyte - N in pediatric patients aged 6 months and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled clinical trials of GaviLyte - N in adults with additional safety and efficacy data from published studies of similar formulations .
Use of GaviLyte - N in children younger than 2 years of age should be carefully monitored for occurrence of possible hypoglycemia , as this solution has no caloric substrate .
Dehydration has been reported in one child and hypokalemia has been reported in 3 children .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of GaviLyte - N did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
