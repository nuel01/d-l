6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of gemcitabine for injection .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Blood and lymphatic system : Thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) • Cardiovascular : Congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , arrhythmias , supraventricular arrhythmias .
• Vascular : Peripheral vasculitis , gangrene , capillary leak syndrome • Skin : Cellulitis , pseudocellulitis , severe skin reactions , including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions • Hepatic : Hepatic failure , hepatic veno - occlusive disease • Pulmonary : Interstitial pneumonitis , pulmonary fibrosis , pulmonary edema , adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , pulmonary eosinophilia • Nervous System : Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal data and its mechanism of action , gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on the use of gemcitabine in pregnant women .
In animal reproduction studies , gemcitabine was teratogenic , embryotoxic , and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [ see Use in Special Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % respectively .
Data Animal Data Gemcitabine is embryotoxic in mice .
Daily dosing of gemcitabine to pregnant mice increased the incidence of fetal malformation ( cleft palate , incomplete ossification ) at doses of 1 . 5 mg / kg / day [ approximately 0 . 005 times the 1000 mg / m2clinical dose based on body surface area ( BSA ) ] .
Gemcitabine was embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rabbits .
Daily dosing of gemcitabine to pregnant rabbits resulted in fetotoxicity ( decreased fetal viability , reduced litter sizes , and developmental delays ) and increased the incidence of fetal malformations ( fused pulmonary artery , absence of gall bladder ) at doses of 0 . 1 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 002 times the 1000 mg / m2clinical dose based on BSA ) .
8 . 3 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of gemcitabine or its metabolites in human milk , or their effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from gemcitabine , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with gemcitabine and for at least one week following the last dose .
8 . 6 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating gemcitabine [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females Because of the potential for genotoxicity , advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with gemcitabine and for 6 months after the final dose of gemcitabine .
Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with gemcitabine and for 3 months after the final dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Males Based on animal studies , gemcitabine may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of gemcitabine for injection have not been established in pediatric patients .
The safety and pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine were evaluated in a trial in pediatric patients with refractory leukemia .
The maximum tolerated dose was 10 mg / m2 / min for 360 minutes weekly for three weeks followed by a one - week rest period .
The safety and activity of gemcitabine for injection were evaluated in a trial of pediatric patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( 22 patients ) and acute myelogenous leukemia ( 10 patients ) at a dose of 10 mg / m2 / min administered over 360 minutes weekly for three weeks followed by a one - week rest period .
Patients with M1 or M2 bone marrow on Day 28 who did not experience unacceptable toxicity were eligible to receive a maximum of one additional four - week course .
Toxicities observed included myelosuppression , febrile neutropenia , increased serum transaminases , nausea , and rash / desquamation .
No meaningful clinical activity was observed in this trial .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Gemcitabine clearance is decreased in females [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In single agent studies of gemcitabine for injection , women , especially older women , were more likely not to proceed to a subsequent cycle and to experience Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 .
2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 8 Gender Gemcitabine clearance is affected by gender [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In single - agent studies of gemcitabine for injection , women , especially older women , were more likely not to proceed to a subsequent cycle and to experience Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for overdoses of gemcitabine .
Myelosuppression , paresthesias , and severe rash were the principal toxicities seen when a single dose as high as 5700 mg / m2was administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks to several patients in a dose - escalation study .
In the event of suspected overdose , monitor with appropriate blood counts and provide supportive therapy , as necessary .
11 DESCRIPTION Gemcitabine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor .
Gemcitabine hydrochloride is 2 ´ - deoxy - 2 ´ , 2 ´ - difluorocytidine monohydrochloride ( β - isomer ) with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The empirical formula for gemcitabine hydrochloride is C9H11F2N3O4 • HCl .
It has a molecular weight of 299 . 66 g / mol .
Gemcitabine hydrochloride is soluble in water , slightly soluble in methanol , and practically insoluble in ethanol and polar organic solvents .
Gemcitabine for injection , USP is a sterile white to off - white lyophilized powder and available as 200 mg and 1 g single - dose vials for intravenous use only .
Each 200 mg vial contains 200 mg gemcitabine hydrochloride ( expressed as free base ) , 200 mg mannitol and 12 . 5 mg sodium acetate .
Each 1 g vial contains 1 g gemcitabine hydrochloride ( expressed as free base ) , 1 g mannitol , and 25 mg sodium acetate .
Hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Gemcitabine kills cells undergoing DNA synthesis and blocks the progression of cells through the G1 / S - phase boundary .
Gemcitabine is metabolized by nucleoside kinases to diphosphate ( dFdCDP ) and triphosphate ( dFdCTP ) nucleosides .
Gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase , an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA synthesis , resulting in reductions in deoxynucleotide concentrations , including dCTP .
Gemcitabine triphosphate competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA .
The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP by the action of the diphosphate enhances the incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA ( self - potentiation ) .
After the gemcitabine nucleotide is incorporated into DNA , only one additional nucleotide is added to the growing DNA strands , which eventually results in the initiation of apoptotic cell death .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine were examined in 353 patients with various solid tumors .
Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using data from patients treated for varying durations of therapy given weekly with periodic rest weeks and using both short infusions ( < 70 minutes ) and long infusions ( 70 to 285 minutes ) .
The total gemcitabine for injection dose varied from 500 mg / m2 to 3600 mg / m2 .
Distribution The volume of distribution was increased with infusion length .
Volume of distribution of gemcitabine was 50 L / m2following infusions lasting < 70 minutes .
For long infusions , the volume of distribution rose to 370 L / m2 .
Gemcitabine pharmacokinetics are linear and are described by a 2 - compartment model .
Population pharmacokinetic analyses of combined single and multiple dose studies showed that the volume of distribution of gemcitabine was significantly influenced by duration of infusion and sex .
Gemcitabine plasma protein binding is negligible .
Elimination Metabolism The active metabolite , gemcitabine triphosphate , can be extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
The half - life of the terminal phase for gemcitabine triphosphate from mononuclear cells ranges from 1 . 7 to 19 . 4 hours .
Excretion Gemcitabine disposition was studied in 5 patients who received a single 1000 mg / m2of radiolabeled drug as a 30 - minute infusion .
Within one week , 92 % to 98 % of the dose was recovered , almost entirely in the urine .
Gemcitabine ( < 10 % ) and the inactive uracil metabolite , 2 ´ - deoxy - 2 ´ , 2 ´ - difluorouridine ( dFdU ) accounted for 99 % of the excreted dose .
The metabolite dFdU is also found in plasma .
Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Clearance of gemcitabine was affected by age .
The lower clearance in geriatric patients results in higher concentrations of gemcitabine for any given dose .
Differences in either clearance or volume of distribution based on patient characteristics or the duration of infusion result in changes in half - life and plasma concentrations .
Table 15 shows plasma clearance and half - life of gemcitabine following short infusions for typical patients by age and sex .
Table 15 Gemcitabine Clearance and Half - Life for the " Typical " Patient a Half - life for patients receiving a < 70 minute infusion .
Age Clearance Men ( L / hr / m2 ) Clearance Women ( L / hr / m2 ) Half - Lifea Men ( min ) Half - Lifea Women ( min ) 29 92 . 2 69 . 4 42 49 45 75 . 7 57 . 0 48 57 65 55 . 1 41 . 5 61 73 79 40 . 7 30 . 7 79 94 Gemcitabine half - life for short infusions ranged from 42 to 94 minutes and for long infusions varied from 245 to 638 minutes , depending on age and sex , reflecting a greatly increased volume of distribution with longer infusions .
Male and Female Patients Females have lower clearance and longer half - lives than male patients as described in Table 15 .
Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies have been conducted with gemcitabine in patients with decreased renal function .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies have been conducted with gemcitabine in patients with decreased hepatic function .
Drug Interaction Studies When gemcitabine ( 1250 mg / m2on Days 1 and 8 ) and cisplatin ( 75 mg / m2on Day 1 ) were administered in patients with NSCLC , the clearance of gemcitabine on Day 1 was 128 L / hr / m2and on Day 8 was 107 L / hr / m2 .
Data from patients with NSCLC demonstrate that gemcitabine and carboplatin given in combination does not alter the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine or carboplatin compared to administration of either single agent ; however , due to wide confidence intervals and small sample size , interpatient variability may be observed .
Data from metastatic breast cancer patients shows that gemcitabine has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics ( clearance and half - life ) of paclitaxel and paclitaxel has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of gemcitabine for injection have not been conducted .
Gemcitabine was mutagenic in an in vitro mouse lymphoma ( L5178Y ) assay and was clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Gemcitabine intraperitoneal doses of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day [ about 1 / 700 the 1000 mg / m2 clinical dose based on body surface area ( BSA ) ] in male mice resulted in moderate to severe hypospermatogenesis , decreased fertility , and decreased implantations .
In female mice , fertility was not affected but maternal toxicities were observed at 1 . 5 mg / kg / day administered intravenously ( about 1 / 200 the 1000 mg / m2 clinical dose based on BSA ) and fetotoxicity or embryolethality was observed at 0 . 25 mg / kg / day administered intravenously ( about 1 / 1300 the 1000 mg / m2clinical dose based on BSA ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Ovarian Cancer The efficacy of gemcitabine for injection was evaluated in a randomized trial ( Study 1 ) conducted in women with advanced ovarian cancer that had relapsed at least 6 months after first - line platinum - based therapy .
Patients were randomized to receive either gemcitabine 1000 mg / m2on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 - day cycle with carboplatin AUC 4 on Day 1 after gemcitabine administration ( n = 178 ) or carboplatin AUC 5 on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle ( n = 178 ) .
The major efficacy outcome measure was progression free survival ( PFS ) .
A total of 356 patients were enrolled .
Demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 16 .
Efficacy results are presented in Table 17 and Figure 1 .
The addition of gemcitabine to carboplatin resulted in statistically significant improvements in PFS and overall response rate .
Approximately 75 % of patients in each arm received additional chemotherapy for disease progression ; 13 of 120 patients in the carboplatin alone arm received gemcitabine for treatment of disease progression .
There was no significant difference in overall survival between the treatment arms .

In Study 5 , patients were randomized to receive either gemcitabine for injection 1000 mg / m2intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks followed by a one - week rest , then once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks every 28 - days in subsequent cycles ( n = 63 ) or fluorouracil 600 mg / m2intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly ( n = 63 ) .
In Study 6 , all patients received gemcitabine for injection 1000 mg / m2intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks followed by a one - week rest , then once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks every 28 - days in subsequent cycles .
The major efficacy outcome measure in both trials was " clinical benefit response " .
A patient was considered to have had a clinical benefit response if either of the following occurred : The patient achieved a ≥ 50 % reduction in pain intensity ( Memorial Pain Assessment Card ) or analgesic consumption , or a 20 - point or greater improvement in performance status ( Karnofsky Performance Status ) for a period of at least 4 consecutive weeks , without showing any sustained worsening in any of the other parameters .
Sustained worsening was defined as 4 consecutive weeks with either any increase in pain intensity or analgesic consumption or a 20 - point decrease in performance status occurring during the first 12 weeks of therapy .
OR The patient was stable on all of the aforementioned parameters and showed a marked , sustained weight gain ( ≥ 7 % increase maintained for ≥ 4 weeks ) not due to fluid accumulation .
Study 5 enrolled 126 patients .
Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between the arms ( Table 22 ) .
The efficacy results are shown in Table 23 and Figure 4 .
Patients treated with gemcitabine for injection had statistically significant increases in clinical benefit response , survival , and time to disease progression compared to those randomized to receive fluorouracil .
No confirmed objective tumor responses were observed in either treatment arm .
