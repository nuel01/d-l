1 . 3 Primary Dysbetalipoproteinemia ( Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia ) CRESTOR is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia ( Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia ) .
1 . 4 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia CRESTOR is indicated as adjunctive therapy to other lipid - lowering treatments ( e . g . , LDL apheresis ) or alone if such treatments are unavailable to reduce LDL - C , Total - C , and ApoB in adult patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia .
1 . 5 Slowing of the Progression of Atherosclerosis CRESTOR is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to slow the progression of atherosclerosis in adult patients as part of a treatment strategy to lower Total - C and LDL - C to target levels .
1 . 6 Limitations of Use The effect of CRESTOR on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined .
CRESTOR has not been studied in Fredrickson Type I and V dyslipidemias .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2 . 1 General Dosing Information The dose range for CRESTOR is 5 to 40 mg orally once daily .
CRESTOR can be administered as a single dose at any time of day , with or without food .
When initiating CRESTOR therapy or switching from another HMG - CoA reductase inhibitor therapy , the appropriate CRESTOR starting dose should first be utilized , and only then titrated according to the patient ’ s response and individualized goal of therapy .
The 40 mg dose of CRESTOR should be used only for those patients who have not achieved their LDL - C goal utilizing the 20 mg dose [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 2 Hyperlipidemia , Mixed Dyslipidemia , Hypertriglyceridemia , Primary Dysbetalipoproteinemia ( Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia ) , and Slowing of the Progression of Atherosclerosis The recommended starting dose of CRESTOR is 10 mg once daily .
For patients with marked hyperlipidemia ( LDL - C greater than 190 mg / dL ) and aggressive lipid targets , a 20 mg starting dose may be considered .
After initiation or upon titration of CRESTOR , lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and the dosage adjusted accordingly .
2 . 3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The recommended starting dose of CRESTOR is 20 mg once daily .
Response to therapy should be estimated from pre - apheresis LDL - C levels .
2 . 4 Dosage in Asian Patients Initiation of CRESTOR therapy with 5 mg once daily should be considered for Asian patients .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 8 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 5 Use with Cyclosporine , or Lopinavir / Ritonavir In patients taking cyclosporine , the dose of CRESTOR should be limited to 5 mg once daily [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
In patients taking a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir the dose of CRESTOR should be limited to 10 mg once daily [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 6 Concomitant Lipid - Lowering Therapy The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when CRESTOR is used in combination with niacin or fenofibrate ; a reduction in CRESTOR dosage should be considered in this setting .
[ see Warnings and Precuations ( 5 . 1 ) and see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 5 , 7 . 6 ) ] Combination therapy with gemfibrozil should be avoided because of an increase in CRESTOR exposure with concomitant use ; if CRESTOR is used in combination with gemfibrozil , the dose of CRESTOR should be limited to 10 mg once daily [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
2 . 7 Dosage in Patients With Severe Renal Impairment For patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) not on hemodialysis , dosing of CRESTOR should be started at 5 mg once daily and not exceed 10 mg once daily [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS CRESTOR is contraindicated in the following conditions : • Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any component of this product .
Hypersensitivity reactions including rash , pruritus , urticaria and angioedema have been reported with CRESTOR [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
• Patients with active liver disease , which may include unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant .
Because HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol , CRESTOR may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
Additionally , there is no apparent benefit to therapy during pregnancy , and safety in pregnant women has not been established .
If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] • Nursing mothers .
Because another drug in this class passes into breast milk , and because HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors have the potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , women who require CRESTOR treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5 . 1 Skeletal Muscle Effects Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , including CRESTOR .
These risks can occur at any dose level , but are increased at the highest dose ( 40 mg ) .
CRESTOR should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy ( e . g . , age ≥ 65 years , inadequately treated hypothyroidism , renal impairment ) .
The risk of myopathy during treatment with CRESTOR may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid - lowering therapies ( fibrates or niacin ) , gemfibrozil , cyclosporine , orlopinavir / ritonavir .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
CRESTOR therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatinine kinase levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected .
CRESTOR therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute , serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis ( e . g . , sepsis , hypotension , dehydration , major surgery , trauma , severe metabolic , endocrine , and electrolyte disorders , or uncontrolled seizures ) .
All patients should be advised to promptly report unexplained muscle pain , tenderness , or weakness , particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever .
5 . 2 Liver Enzyme Abnormalities and Monitoring It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose , and periodically ( e . g . , semiannually ) thereafter .
Increases in serum transaminases [ AST ( SGOT ) or ALT ( SGPT ) ] have been reported with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , including CRESTOR .
In most cases , the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy .
There were two cases of jaundice , for which a relationship to CRESTOR therapy could not be determined , which resolved after discontinuation of therapy .
There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials .
In a pooled analysis of placebo - controlled trials , increases in serum transaminases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1 . 1 % of patients taking CRESTOR versus 0 . 5 % of patients treated with placebo .
Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored until the abnormalities have resolved .
Should an increase in ALT or AST of > 3 times ULN persist , reduction of dose or withdrawal of CRESTOR is recommended .
CRESTOR should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and / or have a history of chronic liver disease [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Active liver disease , which may include unexplained persistent transaminase elevations , is a contraindication to the use of CRESTOR .
[ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] 5 . 3 Concomitant Coumarin Anticoagulants Caution should be exercised when anticoagulants are given in conjunction with CRESTOR because of its potentiation of the effect of coumarin - type anti - coagulants in prolonging the prothrombin time / INR .
In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and CRESTOR concomitantly , INR should be determined before starting CRESTOR and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs .
[ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] 5 . 4 Proteinuria and Hematuria In the CRESTOR clinical trial program , dipstick - positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among CRESTOR treated patients .
These findings were more frequent in patients taking CRESTOR 40 mg , when compared to lower doses of CRESTOR or comparator HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function .
Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown , a dose reduction should be considered for patients on CRESTOR therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and / or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing .
5 . 5 Endocrine Effects Although clinical studies have shown that CRESTOR alone does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve , caution should be exercised if CRESTOR is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones such as ketoconazole , spironolactone , and cimetidine .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label : • Rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and acute renal failure and myopathy ( including myositis ) .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Liver enzyme abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] In the CRESTOR controlled clinical trials database ( placebo or active - controlled ) of 5 , 394 patients with a mean treatment duration of 15 weeks , 1 . 4 % of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions .
The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were : • myalgia • abdominal pain • nausea The most commonly reported adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 2 % ) in the CRESTOR controlled clinical trial database of 5 , 394 patients were : • headache • myalgia • abdominal pain • asthenia • nausea 6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2 % of patients in placebo - controlled clinical studies and at a rate greater than or equal to placebo are shown in Table 1 .
These studies had a treatment duration of up to 12 weeks .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of CRESTOR : arthralgia , hepatic failure , hepatitis , jaundice and memory loss .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Cyclosporine Cyclosporine significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure .
Therefore , in patients taking cyclosporine , therapy should be limited to CRESTOR 5 mg once daily .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Gemfibrozil Gemfibrozil significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure .
Therefore , combination therapy with CRESTOR and gemfibrozil should be avoided .
If used , do not exceed CRESTOR 10 mg once daily .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Lopinavir / Ritonavir The combination of lopinavir and ritonavir significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure .
Therefore , in patients taking a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir , the dose of CRESTOR should be limited to 10 mg once daily .
The effect of other protease inhibitors on rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics has not been examined .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] 7 . 4 Coumarin Anticoagulants CRESTOR significantly increased INR in patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with CRESTOR .
In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and CRESTOR concomitantly , INR should be determined before starting CRESTOR and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] 7 . 5 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when CRESTOR is used in combination with niacin ; a reduction in CRESTOR dosage should be considered in this setting [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] 7 . 6 Fenofibrate When CRESTOR was coadministered with fenofibrate no clinically significant increase in the AUC of rosuvastatin or fenofibrate was observed .
The benefit of further alterations in lipid levels by the combined use of CRESTOR with fibrates should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of this combination .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic effects : Pregnancy Category X .
CRESTOR is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant .
Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy , and cholesterol products are essential for fetal development .
Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipid - lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on long - term outcomes of primary hyperlipidemia therapy .
[ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of CRESTOR in pregnant women .
There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors .
In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , the incidences of congenital anomalies , spontaneous abortions , and fetal deaths / stillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population .
However , this study was only able to exclude a three - to - four - fold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence .
In 89 % of these cases , drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified .
Rosuvastatin crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits .
In rats , CRESTOR was not teratogenic at systemic exposures equivalent to a human therapeutic dose of 40 mg / day .
At 10 - 12 times the human dose of 40 mg / day , there was decreased pup survival , decreased fetal body weight among female pups , and delayed ossification .
In rabbits , pup viability decreased and maternal mortality increased at doses equivalent to the human dose of 40 mg / day .
[ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] CRESTOR may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
If the patient becomes pregnant while taking CRESTOR , the patient should be apprised of the potential risks to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether rosuvastatin is excreted in human milk , but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk .
In rats , breast milk concentrations of rosuvastatin are three times higher than plasma levels ; however , animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels .
Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , women who require CRESTOR treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants .
[ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] 8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CRESTOR in pediatric patients have not been established .
Treatment experience with CRESTOR in a pediatric population is limited to 8 patients with homozygous FH .
None of these patients was below 8 years of age .
In a pharmacokinetic study , 18 patients ( 9 boys and 9 girls ) 10 to 17 years of age with heterozygous FH received single and multiple oral doses of CRESTOR .
Both Cmax and AUC of rosuvastatin were similar to values observed in adult subjects administered the same doses .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 10 , 275 patients in clinical studies with CRESTOR , 3 , 159 ( 31 % ) were 65 years and older , and 698 ( 6 . 8 % ) were 75 years and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
Elderly patients are at higher risk of myopathy and CRESTOR should be prescribed with caution in the elderly .
[ see Warnings and Precautions , ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology , ( 12 . 3 ) ] 8 . 6 Renal Impairment Rosuvastatin exposure is not influenced by mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr greater than or equal to 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) ; however , exposure to rosuvastatin is increased to a clinically significant extent in patients with severe renal impairment who are not receiving hemodialysis .
CRESTOR dosing should be adjusted in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) not requiring hemodialysis .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment CRESTOR is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease , which may include unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels .
Chronic alcohol liver disease is known to increase rosuvastatin exposure ; CRESTOR should be used with caution in these patients .
[ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warning and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Asian Patients Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated an approximate 2 - fold increase in median exposure to rosuvastatin in Asian subjects when compared with Caucasian controls .
CRESTOR dosage should be adjusted in Asian patients .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] 10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific treatment in the event of overdose .
In the event of overdose , the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required .
Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of rosuvastatin .
11 DESCRIPTION CRESTOR ( rosuvastatin calcium ) is a synthetic lipid - lowering agent for oral administration .
The chemical name for rosuvastatin calcium is bis [ ( E ) - 7 - [ 4 - ( 4 - fluorophenyl ) - 6 - isopropyl - 2 - [ methyl ( methylsulfonyl ) amino ] pyrimidin - 5 - yl ] ( 3 R , 5 S ) - 3 , 5 - dihydroxyhept - 6 - enoic acid ] calcium salt with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The empirical formula for rosuvastatin calcium is ( C22H27FN3O6S ) 2 Ca and the molecular weight is 1001 . 14 .
Rosuvastatin calcium is a white amorphous powder that is sparingly soluble in water and methanol , and slightly soluble in ethanol .
Rosuvastatin calcium is a hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient ( octanol / water ) of 0 . 13 at pH of 7 . 0 .
Inactive Ingredients : Each tablet contains : microcrystalline cellulose NF , lactose monohydrate NF , tribasic calcium phosphate NF , crospovidone NF , magnesium stearate NF , hypromellose NF , triacetin NF , titanium dioxide USP , yellow ferric oxide , and red ferric oxide NF .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action CRESTOR is a selective and competitive inhibitor of HMG - CoA reductase , the rate - limiting enzyme that converts 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate , a precursor of cholesterol .
In vivo studies in animals , and in vitro studies in cultured animal and human cells have shown rosuvastatin to have a high uptake into , and selectivity for , action in the liver , the target organ for cholesterol lowering .
In in vivo and in vitro studies , rosuvastatin produces its lipid - modifying effects in two ways .
First , it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell - surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL .
Second , rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL , which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics • Absorption : In clinical pharmacology studies in man , peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing .
Both Cmax and AUC increased in approximate proportion to CRESTOR dose .
The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20 % .
• Administration of CRESTOR with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin .
• The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration .
• Distribution : Mean volume of distribution at steady - state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters .
Rosuvastatin is 88 % bound to plasma proteins , mostly albumin .
This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations .
• Metabolism : Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized ; approximately 10 % of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite .
The major metabolite is N - desmethyl rosuvastatin , which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 2C9 , and in vitro studies have demonstrated that N - desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one - sixth to one - half the HMG - CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound .
Overall , greater than 90 % of active plasma HMG - CoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound .
• Excretion : Following oral administration , rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces ( 90 % ) .
The elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours .
• After an intravenous dose , approximately 28 % of total body clearance was via the renal route , and 72 % by the hepatic route .
• Race : A population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics among Caucasian , Hispanic , and Black or Afro - Caribbean groups .
However , pharmacokinetic studies , including one conducted in the US , have demonstrated an approximate 2 - fold elevation in median exposure ( AUC and Cmax ) in Asian subjects when compared with a Caucasian control group .
• Gender : There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between men and women .
• Geriatric : There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between the nonelderly and elderly populations ( age ≥ 65 years ) .
• Renal Impairment : Mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr greater than or equal to 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) had no influence on plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin .
However , plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin increased to a clinically significant extent ( about 3 - fold ) in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) not receiving hemodialyis compared with healthy subjects ( CLcr greater than 80 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
• Hemodialysis : Steady - state plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin in patients on chronic hemodialysis were approximately 50 % greater compared with healthy volunteer subjects with normal renal function .
• Hepatic Impairment : In patients with chronic alcohol liver disease , plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were modestly increased .
• In patients with Child - Pugh A disease , Cmax and AUC were increased by 60 % and 5 % , respectively , as compared with patients with normal liver function .
In patients with Child - Pugh B disease , Cmax and AUC were increased 100 % and 21 % , respectively , compared with patients with normal liver function .
Drug - Drug Interactions : Cytochrome P450 3A4 Rosuvastatin clearance is not dependent on metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 to a clinically significant extent .

Increased incidence of polyps was not seen at lower doses .
In a 107 - week carcinogenicity study in mice given 10 , 60 , 200 mg / kg / day by oral gavage , an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma / carcinoma was observed at 200 mg / kg / day at systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC .
An increased incidence of hepatocellular tumors was not seen at lower doses .
Rosuvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , the mouse lymphoma assay , and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells .
Rosuvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 5 , 15 , 50 mg / kg / day , males were treated for 9 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout mating until gestation day 7 .
No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 50 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures up to 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
In testicles of dogs treated with rosuvastatin at 30 mg / kg / day for one month , spermatidic giant cells were seen .
Spermatidic giant cells were observed in monkeys after 6 - month treatment at 30 mg / kg / day in addition to vacuolation of seminiferous tubular epithelium .
Exposures in the dog were 20 times and in the monkey 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on body surface area .
Similar findings have been seen with other drugs in this class .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Embryo - fetal Development Rosuvastatin crosses the placenta and is found in fetal tissue and amniotic fluid at 3 % and 20 % , respectively , of the maternal plasma concentration following a single 25 mg / kg oral gavage dose on gestation day 16 in rats .
A higher fetal tissue distribution ( 25 % maternal plasma concentration ) was observed in rabbits after a single oral gavage dose of 1 mg / kg on gestation day 18 .
In female rats given oral gavage doses of 5 , 15 , 50 mg / kg / day rosuvastatin before mating and continuing through day 7 postcoitus results in decreased fetal body weight ( female pups ) and delayed ossification at the high dose ( systemic exposures 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 2 , 10 , 50 mg / kg / day from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 ( weaning ) , decreased pup survival occurred in groups given 50 mg / kg / day , systemic exposures ≥ 12 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on body surface area .
In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0 . 3 , 1 , 3 mg / kg / day from gestation day 6 to lactation day 18 ( weaning ) , exposures equivalent to the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on body surface area , decreased fetal viability and maternal mortality was observed .
Rosuvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at ≤ 25 mg / kg / day or in rabbits ≤ 3 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures equivalent to the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC or body surface area , respectively ) .
Central Nervous System Toxicity CNS vascular lesions , characterized by perivascular hemorrhages , edema , and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces , have been observed in dogs treated with several other members of this drug class .
A chemically similar drug in this class produced dose - dependent optic nerve degeneration ( Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers ) in dogs , at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose .
Edema , hemorrhage , and partial necrosis in the interstitium of the choroid plexus was observed in a female dog sacrificed moribund at day 24 at 90 mg / kg / day by oral gavage ( systemic exposures 100 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
Corneal opacity was seen in dogs treated for 52 weeks at 6 mg / kg / day by oral gavage ( systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
Cataracts were seen in dogs treated for 12 weeks by oral gavage at 30 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures 60 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
Retinal dysplasia and retinal loss were seen in dogs treated for 4 weeks by oral gavage at 90 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures 100 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
Doses ≤ 30 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures ≤ 60 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) did not reveal retinal findings during treatment for up to one year .

In the overall population , the mean LDL - C reduction from baseline was 22 % .
About one - third of the patients benefited from increasing their dose from 20 mg to 40 mg with further LDL lowering of greater than 6 % .
In the 27 patients with at least a 15 % reduction in LDL - C , the mean LDL - C reduction was 30 % ( median 28 % reduction ) .
Among 13 patients with an LDL - C reduction of less than 15 % , 3 had no change or an increase in LDL - C .
Reductions in LDL - C of 15 % or greater were observed in 3 of 5 patients with known receptor negative status .
14 . 6 Slowing of the Progression of Atherosclerosis In the Measuring Effects on Intima Media Thickness : an Evaluation Of Rosuvastatin 40 mg ( METEOR ) study , the effect of therapy with CRESTOR on carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B - mode ultrasonography in patients with elevated LDL - C , at low risk ( Framingham risk less than 10 % over ten years ) for symptomatic coronary artery disease and with subclinical atherosclerosis as evidenced by carotid intimal - medial thickness ( cIMT ) .
In this double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical study 984 patients were randomized ( of whom 876 were analyzed ) in a 5 : 2 ratio to CRESTOR 40 mg or placebo once daily .
Ultrasonograms of the carotid walls were used to determine the annualized rate of change per patient from baseline to two years in mean maximum cIMT of 12 measured segments .
The estimated difference in the rate of change in the maximum cIMT analyzed over all 12 carotid artery sites between CRESTOR - treated patients and placebo - treated patients was - 0 . 0145 mm / year ( 95 % CI – 0 . 0196 , – 0 . 0093 ; p less than 0 . 0001 ) .
The annualized rate of change from baseline for the placebo group was + 0 . 0131 mm / year ( p less than 0 . 0001 ) .
The annualized rate of change from baseline for the CRESTOR group was - 0 . 0014 mm / year ( p = 0 . 32 ) .
At an individual patient level in the CRESTOR group , 52 . 1 % of patients demonstrated an absence of disease progression ( defined as a negative annualized rate of change ) , compared to 37 . 7 % of patients in the placebo group .

Only your health care professional can tell you if CRESTOR is right for you .
What is CRESTOR ?
CRESTOR is a prescription medicine that belongs to a group of cholesterol - lowering medicines called statins .
Along with diet , CRESTOR lowers “ bad ” cholesterol ( LDL - C ) , increases “ good ” cholesterol ( HDL - C ) , and also slows the progression of atherosclerosis in adults with high cholesterol as part of a treatment plan to lower cholesterol to goal .
What is Cholesterol ?
Cholesterol is a fatty substance , also called a lipid , normally found in your bloodstream .
Your body needs a certain amount of cholesterol to function properly .
But high cholesterol can lead to health problems .
LDL - C is called bad cholesterol because if you have too much in your bloodstream , it can become a danger to your health and can lead to potentially serious conditions .
HDL - C is known as good cholesterol because it may help remove excess cholesterol .
Common health factors such as diabetes , high blood pressure , smoking , obesity , family history of early heart disease , and age can make controlling your cholesterol even more important .
What is Atherosclerosis ?
Atherosclerosis is the progressive buildup of plaque in the arteries over time .
One major cause is high levels of LDL - C .
Other health factors , such as family history , diabetes , high blood pressure , or if you smoke , or are overweight , may also play a role in the formation of plaque in arteries .
Often this plaque starts building up in arteries in early adulthood and gets worse over time .
How Does CRESTOR Work ?
Most of the cholesterol in your blood is made in the liver .
CRESTOR works by reducing cholesterol in two ways : CRESTOR blocks an enzyme in the liver causing the liver to make less cholesterol and CRESTOR increases the uptake and breakdown by the liver of cholesterol already in the blood .
