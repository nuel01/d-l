P / N 1017005 Rev . 9 / 2014 Rx only PRESCRIBING INFORMATION ParaGard ® T 380 A Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection ( AIDS ) and other sexually transmitted diseases .
ParaGard ® T 380 A Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive should be placed and removed only by healthcare professionals who are experienced with these procedures .
DESCRIPTION [ MULTIMEDIA ] ParaGard ® T 380 A Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive ( ParaGard ® ) is a T - shaped intrauterine device ( IUD ) , measuring 32 mm horizontally and 36 mm vertically , with a 3 mm diameter bulb at the tip of the vertical stem .
A monofilament polyethylene thread is tied through the tip , resulting in two white threads , each at least 10 . 5 cm in length , to aid in detection and removal of the device .
The T - frame is made of polyethylene with barium sulfate to aid in detecting the device under x - ray .
ParaGard ® also contains copper : approximately 176 mg of wire coiled along the vertical stem and a 68 . 7 mg collar on each side of the horizontal arm .
The total exposed copper surface area is 380 ± 23 mm2 .
One ParaGard ® weighs less than one ( 1 ) gram .
No component of ParaGard ® or its packaging contains latex .
ParaGard ® is packaged together with an insertion tube and solid white rod in a Tyvek ® polyethylene pouch that is then sterilized .
A moveable flange on the insertion tube aids in gauging the depth of insertion through the cervical canal and into the uterine cavity .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The contraceptive effectiveness of ParaGard ® is enhanced by copper continuously released into the uterine cavity .
Mechanism ( s ) by which copper enhances contraceptive efficacy include interference with sperm transport and fertilization of an egg , and possibly prevention of implantation .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE ParaGard ® is indicated for intrauterine contraception for up to 10 years .
The pregnancy rate in clinical studies has been less than 1 pregnancy per 100 women each year .

• Cervical mucus ( ovulation ) method supplemented by calendar in the pre - ovulatory and basal body temperature in the post - ovulatory phases .
• With spermicidal cream or jelly .
• Without spermicides .
• The treatment schedule is one dose within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse , and a second dose 12 hours after the first dose .
Preven is the only dedicated product specifically marketed for emergency contraception .
The Food and Drug Administration has also declared the following brands of oral contraceptive to be safe and effective for emergency contraception : Ovral ( 1 dose is 2 white pills ) , Alesse ( 1 dose is 5 pink pills ) , Nordette or Levlen ( 1 dose is 4 light - orange pills ) , Lo / Ovral ( 1 dose is 4 white pills ) , Triphasil or Tri - Levlen ( 1 dose is 4 yellow pills ) .
• However , to maintain effective protection against pregnancy , another method of contraception must be used as soon as menstruation resumes , the frequency or duration of breastfeeds is reduced , bottle feeds are introduced , or the baby reaches 6 months of age .
CONTRAINDICATIONS ParaGard ® should not be placed when one or more of the following conditions exist : • Pregnancy or suspicion of pregnancy • Abnormalities of the uterus resulting in distortion of the uterine cavity • Acute pelvic inflammatory disease , or current behavior suggesting a high risk for pelvic inflammatory disease • Postpartum endometritis or postabortal endometritis in the past 3 months • Known or suspected uterine or cervical malignancy • Genital bleeding of unknown etiology • Mucopurulent cervicitis • Wilson ’ s disease • Allergy to any component of ParaGard ® • A previously placed IUD that has not been removed WARNINGS 1 .
Intrauterine Pregnancy If intrauterine pregnancy occurs with ParaGard ® in place and the string is visible , ParaGard ® should be removed because of the risk of spontaneous abortion , premature delivery , sepsis , septic shock , and , rarely , death .
Removal may be followed by pregnancy loss .
If the string is not visible , and the woman decides to continue her pregnancy , check if the ParaGard ® is in her uterus ( for example , by ultrasound ) .
If ParaGard ® is in her uterus , warn her that there is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and sepsis , septic shock , and rarely , death . 1 In addition , the risk of premature labor and delivery is increased . 1 Human data about risk of birth defects from copper exposure are limited .
However , studies have not detected a pattern of abnormalities , and published reports do not suggest a risk that is higher than the baseline risk for birth defects .
2 .
Ectopic Pregnancy Women who become pregnant while using ParaGard ® should be evaluated for ectopic pregnancy .
A pregnancy that occurs with ParaGard ® in place is more likely to be ectopic than a pregnancy in the general population .
However , because ParaGard ® prevents most pregnancies , women who use ParaGard ® have a lower risk of an ectopic pregnancy than sexually active women who do not use any contraception . 2 - 3 3 .
Pelvic Infection Although pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) in women using IUDs is uncommon , IUDs may be associated with an increased relative risk of PID compared to other forms of contraception and to no contraception .
The highest incidence of PID occurs within 20 days following insertion .
Therefore , the visit following the first post - insertion menstrual period is an opportunity to assess the patient for infection , as well as to check that the IUD is in place .
( See INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE , Continuing Care . )
Since pelvic infection is most frequently associated with sexually transmitted organisms , IUDs are not recommended for women at high risk for sexual infection .
Prophylactic antibiotics at the time of insertion do not appear to lower the incidence of PID . 4 PID can have serious consequences , such as tubal damage ( leading to ectopic pregnancy or infertility ) , hysterectomy , sepsis , and , rarely , death .
It is therefore important to promptly assess and treat any woman who develops signs or symptoms of PID .
Guidelines for treatment of PID are available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , Atlanta , Georgia at www . cdc . gov or 1 - 800 - 311 - 3435 .
Antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy .
Most healthcare professionals also remove the IUD .
The significance of actinomyces - like organisms on Papanicolaou smear in an asymptomatic IUD user is unknown , 5 - 6 and so this finding alone does not always require IUD removal and treatment .
However , because pelvic actinomycosis is a serious infection , a woman who has symptoms of pelvic infection possibly due to actinomyces should be treated and have her IUD removed .
4 .
Immunocompromise Women with AIDS should not have IUDs inserted unless they are clinically stable on antiretroviral therapy .
Limited data suggest that asymptomatic women infected with human immunodeficiency virus may use intrauterine devices .
Little is known about the use of IUDs in women who have illnesses causing serious immunocompromise .
Therefore these women should be carefully monitored for infection if they choose to use an IUD .
The risk of pregnancy should be weighed against the theoretical risk of infection .
5 .
Embedment Partial penetration or embedment of ParaGard ® in the myometrium can make removal difficult .
In some cases , surgical removal may be necessary .
6 .
Perforation Partial or total perforation of the uterine wall or cervix may occur rarely during placement , although it may not be detected until later .
Spontaneous migration has also been reported .
If perforation does occur , remove ParaGard ® promptly , since the copper can lead to intraperitoneal adhesions .
Intestinal penetration , intestinal obstruction , and / or damage to adjacent organs may result if an IUD is left in the peritoneal cavity .
Pre - operative imaging followed by laparoscopy or laparotomy is often required to remove an IUD from the peritoneal cavity .
7 .
Expulsion Expulsion can occur , usually during the menses and usually in the first few months after insertion .
There is an increased risk of expulsion in the nulliparous patient .
If unnoticed , an unintended pregnancy could occur .
8 .
Wilson ’ s Disease Theoretically , ParaGard ® can exacerbate Wilson ’ s disease , a rare genetic disease affecting copper excretion .
PRECAUTIONS Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection ( AIDS ) and other sexually transmitted diseases .
1 .
Information for patients Before inserting ParaGard ® discuss the Patient Package Insert with the patient , and give her time to read the information .
Discuss any questions she may have concerning ParaGard ® as well as other methods of contraception .
Instruct her to promptly report symptoms of infection , pregnancy , or missing strings .
2 .
Insertion precautions , continuing care , and removal .
( See INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE . )
3 .
Vaginal bleeding In the 2 largest clinical trials with ParaGard ® ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Table 2 ) , menstrual changes were the most common medical reason for discontinuation of ParaGard ® .
Discontinuation rates for pain and bleeding combined are highest in the first year of use and diminish thereafter .
The percentage of women who discontinued ParaGard ® because of bleeding problems or pain during these studies ranged from 11 . 9 % in the first year to 2 . 2 % in year 9 .
Women complaining of heavy vaginal bleeding should be evaluated and treated , and may need to discontinue ParaGard ® .
( See ADVERSE REACTIONS . )
4 .
Vasovagal reactions , including fainting Some women have vasovagal reactions immediately after insertion .
Hence , patients should remain supine until feeling well and should be cautious when getting up .
5 .
Expulsion following placement after a birth or abortion ParaGard ® has been placed immediately after delivery , although risk of expulsion may be higher than when ParaGard ® is placed at times unrelated to delivery . 7 However , unless done immediately postpartum , insertion should be delayed to the second postpartum month because insertion during the first postpartum month ( except for immediately after delivery ) has been associated with increased risk of perforation . 8 ParaGard ® can be placed immediately after abortion , although immediate placement has a slightly higher risk of expulsion than placement at other times . 9 Placement after second trimester abortion is associated with a higher risk of expulsion than placement after the first trimester abortion . 9 6 .
Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) Limited data suggest that MRI at the level of 1 . 5 Tesla is acceptable in women using ParaGard ® .
One study examined the effect of MRI on the CU - 7 ® Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive and Lippes Loop ™ intrauterine devices .
Neither device moved under the influence of the magnetic field or heated during the spin - echo sequences usually employed for pelvic imaging . 10 An in vitro study did not detect movement or temperature change when ParaGard ® was subjected to MRI . 11 7 .
Medical diathermy Theoretically , medical ( non - surgical ) diathermy ( short - wave and microwave heat therapy ) in a patient with a metal - containing IUD may cause heat injury to the surrounding tissue .
However , a small study of eight women did not detect a significant elevation of intrauterine temperature when diathermy was performed in the presence of a copper IUD . 12 8 .
Pregnancy ParaGard ® is contraindicated during pregnancy .
( See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS . )
9 .
Nursing mothers Nursing mothers may use ParaGard ® .
No difference has been detected in concentration of copper in human milk before and after insertion of copper IUDs .
The literature is conflicting , but limited data suggest that there may be an increased risk of perforation and expulsion if a woman is lactating .
13 10 .
Pediatric use ParaGard ® is not indicated before menarche .
Safety and efficacy have been established in women over 16 years old .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse events associated with intrauterine contraception are discussed in WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .
These include : Intrauterine pregnancy Pelvic infection Septic abortion Perforation Ectopic pregnancy Embedment Table 2 shows discontinuation rates from two clinical studies by adverse event and year .

The following adverse events have also been observed .
These are listed alphabetically and not by order of frequency or severity .
Anemia Menstrual flow , prolonged Backache Menstrual spotting Dysmenorrhea Pain and cramping Dyspareunia Urticarial allergic skin reaction Expulsion , complete or partial Vaginitis Leukorrhea INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE The placement technique for ParaGard ® is different from that used for other IUDs .
Therefore , the clinician should be familiar with the following instructions .
ParaGard ® may be placed at any time during the cycle when the clinician is reasonably certain the patient is not pregnant .
For information about timing of postpartum and postabortion insertions , see PRECAUTIONS .
A single ParaGard ® should be placed at the fundus of the uterine cavity .
ParaGard ® should be removed on or before 10 years from the date of insertion .
Before Placement : • Make sure that the patient is an appropriate candidate for ParaGard ® and that she has read the Patient Package Insert .
• Use of an analgesic before insertion is at the discretion of the patient and the clinician .
• Establish the size and position of the uterus by pelvic examination .
• Insert a speculum and cleanse the vagina and cervix with an antiseptic solution .
• Apply a tenaculum to the cervix and use gentle traction to align the cervical canal with the uterine cavity .
• Gently insert a sterile sound to measure the depth of the uterine cavity .
• The uterus should sound to a depth of 6 to 9 cm except when inserting ParaGard ® immediately post - abortion or post - partum .
Insertion of ParaGard ® into a uterine cavity measuring less than 6 cm may increase the incidence of expulsion , bleeding , pain , and perforation .
If you encounter cervical stenosis , avoid undue force .
Dilators may be helpful in this situation .
How to Load and Place ParaGard ® : Do not bend the arms of ParaGard ® earlier than 5 minutes before it is to be placed in the uterus .
Use aseptic technique when handling ParaGard ® and the part of the insertion tube that will enter the uterus .
STEP 1 Load ParaGard ® into the insertion tube by folding the two horizontal arms of ParaGard ® against the stem and push the tips of the arms securely into the inserter tube .
If you do not have sterile gloves , you can do STEPS 1 and 2 while ParaGard ® is in the sterile package .
First , place the package face up on a clean surface .
Next , open at the bottom end ( where arrow says OPEN ) .
Pull the solid white rod partially from the package so it will not interfere with assembly .
Place thumb and index finger on top of package on ends of the horizontal arms .
Use other hand to push insertion tube against arms of ParaGard ® ( shown by arrow in Fig . 1 ) .
This will start bending the T arms .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] STEP 2 Bring the thumb and index finger closer together to continue bending the arms until they are alongside the stem .
Use the other hand to withdraw the insertion tube just enough so that the insertion tube can be pushed and rotated onto the tips of the arms .
Your goal is to secure the tips of the arms inside the tube ( Fig . 2 ) .
Insert the arms no further than necessary to insure retention .
Introduce the solid white rod into the insertion tube from the bottom , alongside the threads , until it touches the bottom of the ParaGard ® .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] STEP 3 Grasp the insertion tube at the open end of the package ; adjust the blue flange so that the distance from the top of the ParaGard ® ( where it protrudes from the inserter ) to the blue flange is the same as the uterine depth that you measured with the sound .
Rotate the insertion tube so that the horizontal arms of the T and the long axis of the blue flange lie in the same horizontal plane ( Fig . 3 ) .
Now pass the loaded insertion tube through the cervical canal until ParaGard ® just touches the fundus of the uterus .
The blue flange should be at the cervix in the horizontal plane .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] STEP 4 To release the arms of ParaGard ® , hold the solid white rod steady and withdraw the insertion tube no more than one centimeter .
This releases the arms of ParaGard ® high in the uterine fundus ( Fig . 4 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] STEP 5 Gently and carefully move the insertion tube upward toward the top of the uterus , until slight resistance is felt .
This will ensure placement of the T at the highest possible position within the uterus ( Fig . 5 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] STEP 6 Hold the insertion tube steady and withdraw the solid white rod ( Fig . 6 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] STEP 7 Gently and slowly withdraw the insertion tube from the cervical canal .
Only the threads should be visible protruding from the cervix .
( Fig . 7 ) .
Trim the threads so that 3 to 4 cm protrude into the vagina .
Note the length of the threads in the patient ’ s records .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] If you suspect that ParaGard ® is not in the correct position , check placement ( with ultrasound , if necessary ) .
If ParaGard ® is not positioned completely within the uterus , remove it and replace it with a new ParaGard ® .
Do not reinsert an expelled or partially expelled ParaGard ® .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CAUTION Instrumentation of the cervical os may result in vasovagal reactions , including fainting .
Have the patient remain supine until she feels well , and have her get up with caution .
Continuing Care : Following placement , examine the patient after her first menses to confirm that ParaGard ® is still in place .
You should be able to see or feel only the threads .
If ParaGard ® has been partially or completely expelled , remove it .
You can place a new ParaGard ® if the patient desires and if she is not pregnant .
Do not reinsert a used ParaGard ® .
Evaluate the patient promptly if she complains of any of the following : • Abdominal or pelvic pain , cramping , or tenderness ; malodorous discharge ; bleeding ; fever • A missed period ( See WARNINGS , Pelvic Infection , Intrauterine Pregnancy and Ectopic Pregnancy . )
The length of the visible threads may change with time .
However , no action is needed unless you suspect partial expulsion , perforation , or pregnancy .
If you cannot find the threads in the vagina , check that ParaGard ® is still in the uterus .
The threads can retract into the uterus or break , or ParaGard ® can break , perforate the uterus , or be expelled .
Gentle probing of the cavity , radiography , or sonography may be required to locate the IUD .
If there is evidence of partial expulsion , perforation , or breakage , remove ParaGard ® .
How to Remove ParaGard ® Remove ParaGard ® with forceps , pulling gently on the exposed threads .
The arms of ParaGard ® will fold upwards as it is withdrawn from the uterus .
You may immediately insert a new ParaGard ® if the patient requests it and has no contraindications .
Embedment or breakage of ParaGard ® in the myometrium can make removal difficult .
Analgesia , paracervical anesthesia , and cervical dilation may assist in removing an embedded ParaGard ® .
An alligator forceps or other grasping instrument may be helpful .
Hysteroscopy may also be helpful .
HOW SUPPLIED ParaGard ® is available in cartons of 1 ( one ) sterile unit ( NDC 51285 - 204 - 01 ) .
Each ParaGard ® is packaged together with an insertion tube and solid white rod in a Tyvek ® polyethylene pouch .

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS ParaGard ® T 380 A Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive ParaGard ® T 380 A Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive is used to prevent pregnancy .
It does not protect against HIV infection ( AIDS ) and other sexually transmitted diseases .
It is important for you to understand this brochure and discuss it with your healthcare provider before choosing ParaGard ® T 380 A Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive ( ParaGard ® ) .
You should also learn about other birth control methods that may be an option for you .
What is ParaGard ® ?
ParaGard ® is a copper - releasing device that is placed in your uterus to prevent pregnancy for up to 10 years .
ParaGard ® is made of white plastic in the shape of a “ T . ” Copper is wrapped around the stem and arms of the “ T ” .
Two white threads are attached to the stem of the “ T ” .
The threads are the only part of ParaGard ® that you can feel when ParaGard ® is in your uterus .
ParaGard ® and its components do not contain latex .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] How long can I keep ParaGard ® in place ?
You can keep ParaGard ® in your uterus for up to 10 years .
After 10 years , you should have ParaGard ® removed by your healthcare provider .
If you wish and if it is still right for you , you may get a new ParaGard ® during the same visit .
What if I change my mind and want to become pregnant ?
Your healthcare provider can remove ParaGard ® at any time .
After discontinuation of ParaGard ® , its contraceptive effect is reversed .
How does ParaGard ® work ?
Ideas about how ParaGard ® works include preventing sperm from reaching the egg , preventing sperm from fertilizing the egg , and possibly preventing the egg from attaching ( implanting ) in the uterus .
ParaGard ® does not stop your ovaries from making an egg ( ovulating ) each month .
How well does ParaGard ® work ?
Fewer than 1 in 100 women become pregnant each year while using ParaGard ® .
The table below shows the chance of getting pregnant using different types of birth control .
The numbers show typical use , which includes people who do n't always use birth control correctly .

You might choose ParaGard ® if you • need birth control that is very effective • need birth control that stops working when you stop using it • need birth control that is easy to use Who should not use ParaGard ® ?
You should not use ParaGard ® if you • Might be pregnant • Have a uterus that is abnormally shaped inside • Have a pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) or have current behavior that puts you at high risk of PID ( for example , because you are having sex with several men , or your partner is having sex with other women ) • Have had an infection in your uterus after a pregnancy or abortion in the past 3 months • Have cancer of the uterus or cervix • Have unexplained bleeding from your vagina • Have an infection in your cervix • Have Wilson ’ s disease ( a disorder in how the body handles copper ) • Are allergic to anything in ParaGard ® • Already have an intrauterine contraceptive in your uterus How is ParaGard ® placed in the uterus ?
ParaGard ® is placed in your uterus during an office visit .
Your healthcare provider first examines you to find the position of your uterus .
Next , he or she will cleanse your vagina and cervix , measure your uterus , and then slide a plastic tube containing ParaGard ® into your uterus .
The tube is removed , leaving ParaGard ® inside your uterus .
Two white threads extend into your vagina .
The threads are trimmed so they are just long enough for you to feel with your fingers when doing a self - check .
As ParaGard ® goes in , you may feel cramping or pinching .
Some women feel faint , nauseated , or dizzy for a few minutes afterwards .
Your healthcare provider may ask you to lie down for a while and to get up slowly .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] How do I check that ParaGard ® is in my uterus ?
Visit your healthcare provider for a check - up about one month after placement to make sure ParaGard ® is still in your uterus .
You can also check to make sure that ParaGard ® is still in your uterus by reaching up to the top of your vagina with clean fingers to feel the two threads .
Do not pull on the threads .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] If you cannot feel the threads , ask your healthcare provider to check if ParaGard ® is in the right place .
If you can feel more of ParaGard ® than just the threads , ParaGard ® is not in the right place .
If you can ’ t see your healthcare provider right away , use an additional birth control method .
If ParaGard ® is in the wrong place , your chances of getting pregnant are increased .
It is a good habit for you to check that ParaGard ® is in place once a month .
You may use tampons when you are using ParaGard ® .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] What if I become pregnant while using ParaGard ® ?
If you think you are pregnant , contact your healthcare professional right away .
If you are pregnant and ParaGard ® is in your uterus , you may get a severe infection or shock , have a miscarriage or premature labor and delivery , or even die .
Because of these risks , your healthcare provider will recommend that you have ParaGard ® removed , even though removal may cause miscarriage .
If you continue a pregnancy with ParaGard ® in place , see your healthcare provider regularly .
Contact your healthcare provider right away if you get fever , chills , cramping , pain , bleeding , flu - like symptoms , or an unusual , bad smelling vaginal discharge .
A pregnancy with ParaGard ® in place has a greater than usual chance of being ectopic ( outside your uterus ) .
Ectopic pregnancy is an emergency that may require surgery .
An ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding , infertility , and death .
Unusual vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain may be signs of an ectopic pregnancy .
Copper in ParaGard ® does not seem to cause birth defects .
What side effects can I expect with ParaGard ® ?
The most common side effects of ParaGard ® are heavier , longer periods and spotting between periods ; most of these side effects diminish after 2 - 3 months .
However , if your menstrual flow continues to be heavy or long , or spotting continues , contact your healthcare provider .
Infrequently , serious side effects may occur : • Pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) : Uncommonly , ParaGard ® and other IUDs are associated with PID .
PID is an infection of the uterus , tubes , and nearby organs .
PID is most likely to occur in the first 20 days after placement .
You have a higher chance of getting PID if you or your partner have sex with more than one person .
PID is treated with antibiotics .
However , PID can cause serious problems such as infertility , ectopic pregnancy , and chronic pelvic pain .
Rarely , PID may even cause death .
More serious cases of PID require surgery or a hysterectomy ( removal of the uterus ) .
Contact your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the signs of PID : abdominal or pelvic pain , painful sex , unusual or bad smelling vaginal discharge , chills , heavy bleeding , or fever .
• Difficult removals : Occasionally ParaGard ® may be hard to remove because it is stuck in the uterus .
Surgery may sometimes be needed to remove ParaGard ® .
• Perforation : Rarely , ParaGard ® goes through the wall of the uterus , especially during placement .
This is called perforation .
If ParaGard ® perforates the uterus , it should be removed .
