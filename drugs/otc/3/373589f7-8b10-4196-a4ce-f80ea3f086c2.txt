It is formulated for oral use .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY General Pentosan polysulfate sodium is a low molecular weight heparin - like compound .
It has anticoagulant and fibrinolytic effects .
The mechanism of action of pentosan polysulfate sodium in interstitial cystitis is not known .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a clinical pharmacology study in which healthy female volunteers received a single oral 300 or 450 mg dose of pentosan polysulfate sodium containing radiolabeled drug as a solution under fasted conditions , maximal levels of plasma radioactivity were seen approximately at a median of 2 hours ( range 0 . 6 – 120 hours ) after dosing .
Based on urinary excretion of radioactivity , a mean of approximately 6 % of a radiolabeled oral dose of pentosan polysulfate sodium is absorbed and reaches the systemic circulation .
Food Effects In clinical trials , ELMIRON ® was administered with water 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals ; the effect of food on absorption of pentosan polysulfate sodium is not known .
Distribution Preclinical studies with parenterally administered radiolabeled pentosan polysulfate sodium showed distribution to the uroepithelium of the genitourinary tract with lesser amounts found in the liver , spleen , lung , skin , periosteum , and bone marrow .
Erythrocyte penetration is low in animals .
Metabolism The fraction of pentosan polysulfate sodium that is absorbed is metabolized by partial desulfation in the liver and spleen , and by partial depolymerization in the kidney to a large number of metabolites .
Both the desulfation and depolymerization can be saturated with continued dosing .
Excretion Following administration of an oral solution of a 300 or 450 mg dose of pentosan polysulfate sodium containing radiolabeled drug to groups of healthy subjects , plasma radioactivity declined with mean half - lives of 27 and 20 hours , respectively .
A large proportion of the orally administered dose of pentosan polysulfate sodium ( mean 84 % in the 300 mg group and 58 % in the 450 mg group ) is excreted in feces as unchanged drug .
A mean of 6 % of an oral dose is excreted in the urine , mostly as desulfated and depolymerized metabolites .
Only a small fraction of the administered dose ( mean 0 . 14 % ) is recovered as intact drug in urine .
Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of pentosan polysulfate sodium has not been studied in geriatric patients or in patients with hepatic or renal impairment .
See also PRECAUTIONS - Hepatic Insufficiency .
Drug - Drug Interactions In a study in which healthy subjects received pentosan polysulfate sodium 100 mg capsule or placebo every 8 hours for 7 days , and were titrated with warfarin to an INR of 1 . 4 to 1 . 8 , the pharmacokinetic parameters of R - warfarin and S - warfarin were similar in the absence and presence of pentosan polysulfate sodium .
INR for warfarin + placebo and warfarin + pentosan polysulfate sodium were comparable .
See also PRECAUTIONS on the use of ELMIRON ® in patients receiving other therapies with anticoagulant effects .
Pharmacodynamics The mechanism by which pentosan polysulfate sodium achieves its effects in patients is unknown .
In preliminary clinical models , pentosan polysulfate sodium adhered to the bladder wall mucosal membrane .
The drug may act as a buffer to control cell permeability preventing irritating solutes in the urine from reaching the cells .
CLINICAL TRIALS ELMIRON ® was evaluated in two clinical trials for the relief of pain in patients with chronic interstitial cystitis ( IC ) .
All patients met the NIH definition of IC based upon the results of cystoscopy , cytology , and biopsy .
One blinded , randomized , placebo controlled study evaluated 151 patients ( 145 women , 5 men , 1 unknown ) with a mean age of 44 years ( range 18 to 81 ) .
Approximately equal numbers of patients received either placebo or ELMIRON ® 100 mg three times a day for 3 months .
Clinical improvement in bladder pain was based upon the patient ' s own assessment .
In this study , 28 / 74 ( 38 % ) of patients who received ELMIRON ® and 13 / 74 ( 18 % ) of patients who received placebo , showed greater than 50 % improvement in bladder pain ( p = 0 . 005 ) .
A second clinical trial , the physician ' s usage study , was a prospectively designed retrospective analysis of 2499 patients who received ELMIRON ® 300 mg a day without blinding .
Of the 2499 patients , 2220 were women , 254 were men , and 25 were of unknown sex .
The patients had a mean age of 47 years and 23 % were over 60 years of age .
By 3 months , 1307 ( 52 % ) of the patients had dropped out or were ineligible for analysis , overall , 1192 ( 48 % ) received ELMIRON ® for 3 months ; 892 ( 36 % ) received ELMIRON ® for 6 months ; and 598 ( 24 % ) received ELMIRON ® for one year .
Patients had unblinded evaluations every 3 months for the patient ' s rating of overall change in pain in comparison to baseline and for the difference calculated in " pain / discomfort " scores .
At baseline , pain / discomfort scores for the original 2499 patients were severe or unbearable in 60 % , moderate in 33 % and mild or none in 7 % of patients .
The extent of the patients ' pain improvement is shown in Table 1 .
At 3 months , 722 / 2499 ( 29 % ) of the patients originally in the study had pain scores that improved by one or two categories .
By 6 months , in the 892 patients who continued taking ELMIRON ® , an additional 116 / 2499 ( 5 % ) of patients had improved pain scores .
After 6 months , the percent of patients who reported the first onset of pain relief was less than 1 . 5 % of patients who originally entered in the study ( see Table 2 ) .

CONTRAINDICATIONS ELMIRON ® is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug , structurally related compounds , or excipients .
WARNINGS None .
PRECAUTIONS General ELMIRON ® is a weak anticoagulant ( 1 / 15 the activity of heparin ) .
At a daily dose of 300 mg ( n = 128 ) , rectal hemorrhage was reported as an adverse event in 6 . 3 % of patients .
Bleeding complications of ecchymosis , epistaxis , and gum hemorrhage have been reported ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Patients undergoing invasive procedures or having signs / symptoms of underlying coagulopathy or other increased risk of bleeding ( due to other therapies such as coumarin anticoagulants , heparin , t - PA , streptokinase , high dose aspirin , or nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ) should be evaluated for hemorrhage .
Patients with diseases such as aneurysms , thrombocytopenia , hemophilia , gastrointestinal ulcerations , polyps , or diverticula should be carefully evaluated before starting ELMIRON ® .
A similar product that was given subcutaneously , sublingually , or intramuscularly ( and not initially metabolized by the liver ) is associated with delayed immunoallergic thrombocytopenia with symptoms of thrombosis and hemorrhage .
Caution should be exercised when using ELMIRON ® in patients who have a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia .
Alopecia is associated with pentosan polysulfate and with heparin products .
In clinical trials of ELMIRON ® , alopecia began within the first 4 weeks of treatment .
Ninety - seven percent ( 97 % ) of the cases of alopecia reported were alopecia areata , limited to a single area on the scalp .
Hepatic Insufficiency ELMIRON ® has not been studied in patients with hepatic insufficiency .
Because there is evidence of hepatic contribution to the elimination of ELMIRON ® , hepatic impairment may have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of ELMIRON ® .
Caution should be exercised when using ELMIRON ® in this patient population .
Mildly ( < 2 . 5 × normal ) elevated transaminase , alkaline phosphatase , γ - glutamyl transpeptidase , and lactic dehydrogenase occurred in 1 . 2 % of patients .
The increases usually appeared 3 to 12 months after the start of ELMIRON ® therapy , and were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms .
These abnormalities are usually transient , may remain essentially unchanged , or may rarely progress with continued use .
Increases in PTT and PT ( < 1 % for both ) or thrombocytopenia ( 0 . 2 % ) were noted .
Information for Patients Patients should take the drug as prescribed , in the dosage prescribed , and no more frequently than prescribed .
Patients should be reminded that ELMIRON ® has a weak anticoagulant effect .
This effect may increase bleeding times .
Laboratory Test Findings Pentosan polysulfate sodium did not affect prothrombin time ( PT ) or partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) up to 1200 mg per day in 24 healthy male subjects treated for 8 days .
Pentosan polysulfate sodium also inhibits the generation of factor Xa in plasma and inhibits thrombin - induced platelet aggregation in human platelet rich plasma ex vivo .
( See PRECAUTIONS - Hepatic Insufficiency Section for additional information . )
Carcinogenicity , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long term carcinogenicity studies of ELMIRON ® in F344 / N rats and B6C3F1 mice have been conducted .
In these studies , ELMIRON ® was orally administered once daily via gavage , 5 days per week , for up to 2 years .
The dosages administered to mice were 56 , 168 or 504 mg / kg .
The dosages administered to rats were 14 , 42 , or 126 mg / kg for males , and 28 , 84 , or 252 mg / kg for females .
The dosages tested were up to 60 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) in rats , and up to 117 times the MRHD in mice , on a mg / kg basis .
The results of these studies in rodents showed no clear evidence of drug - related tumorigenesis or carcinogenic risk .
Pentosan polysulfate sodium was not clastogenic or mutagenic when tested in the mouse micronucleus test or the Ames test ( S . typhimurium ) .
The effect of pentosan polysulfate sodium on spermatogenesis has not been investigated .
Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats with intravenous daily doses of 15 mg / kg , and in rabbits with 7 . 5 mg / kg .
These doses are 0 . 42 and 0 . 14 times the daily oral human doses of ELMIRON ® when normalized to body surface area .
These studies did not reveal evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus from ELMIRON ® .
Direct in vitro bathing of cultured mouse embryos with pentosan polysulfate sodium ( PPS ) at a concentration of 1 mg / mL may cause reversible limb bud abnormalities .
Adequate and well - controlled studies have not been performed in pregnant women .
Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when ELMIRON ® is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 16 years have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS ELMIRON ® was evaluated in clinical trials in a total of 2627 patients ( 2343 women , 262 men , 22 unknown ) with a mean age of 47 [ range 18 to 88 with 581 ( 22 % ) over 60 years of age ] .
Of the 2627 patients , 128 patients were in a 3 month trial and the remaining 2499 patients were in a long term , unblinded trial .
Deaths occurred in 6 / 2627 ( 0 . 2 % ) patients who received the drug over a period of 3 to 75 months .
The deaths appear to be related to other concurrent illnesses or procedures , except in one patient for whom the cause was not known .
Serious adverse events occurred in 33 / 2627 ( 1 . 3 % ) patients .
Two patients had severe abdominal pain or diarrhea and dehydration that required hospitalization .
Because there was not a control group of patients with interstitial cystitis who were concurrently evaluated , it is difficult to determine which events are associated with ELMIRON ® and which events are associated with concurrent illness , medicine , or other factors .
