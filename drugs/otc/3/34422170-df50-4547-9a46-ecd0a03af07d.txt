4 CONTRAINDICATIONS REBINYN is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to REBINYN or its components ( including hamster proteins ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Description ( 11 ) ] Do not use in patients who have known hypersensitivity to REBINYN or its components , including hamster proteins ( 4 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , have occurred .
Should hypersensitivity reactions occur , discontinue REBINYN and administer appropriate treatment ( 5 . 1 ) .
• • Neutralizing antibodies ( inhibitors ) to Factor IX have occurred following administration of REBINYN .
Perform an assay that measures Factor IX inhibitor concentration if bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose of REBINYN or if plasma Factor IX activity level fails to increase as expected ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 5 ) .
• • The use of Factor IX - products has been associated with the development of thromboembolic complications ( 5 . 3 ) .
• • Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following immune tolerance induction with Factor IX - containing products in hemophilia B patients with Factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions to Factor IX .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Factor IX activity assay results may vary with the type of activated partial thromboplastin time reagent used ( 5 . 5 ) .
5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Allergic - type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , have occurred with REBINYN .
The product may contain traces of hamster proteins which in some patients may cause allergic reactions .
Signs of allergic reactions , which can progress to anaphylaxis , may include angioedema , chest tightness , difficulty breathing , wheezing , urticaria , and itching .
Observe patients for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions , particularly during the early phases of exposure to the product .
Discontinue use of REBINYN if allergic - or anaphylactic - type reactions occur , and initiate appropriate treatment .
5 . 2 Inhibitors The formation of inhibitors ( neutralizing antibodies ) to Factor IX has occurred following REBINYN .
If expected plasma factor IX activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled as expected with the administered dose , perform an assay that measures Factor IX inhibitor concentration .
Monitor all patients using clinical observations and laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
An association between the development of Factor IX inhibitors and allergic reactions has been reported .
Evaluate patients experiencing allergic reactions for the presence of an inhibitor .
Patients with Factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of severe allergic reactions with subsequent exposure to Factor IX .
5 . 3 Thrombotic Events The use of Factor IX - containing products has been associated with thromboembolic complications .
Due to the potential risk of thromboembolic complications , monitor patients for early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy when administering this product to patients with liver disease , post - operatively , to newborn infants , or to patients at risk of thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) .
In each of these situations , the benefit of treatment with REBINYN should be weighed against the risk of these complications .
5 . 4 Nephrotic Syndrome Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following immune tolerance induction therapy with Factor IX products in hemophilia B patients with Factor IX inhibitors , often with a history of allergic reactions to Factor IX .
The safety and efficacy of using REBINYN for immune tolerance induction have not been established .
5 . 5 Monitoring Laboratory Tests If monitoring of Factor IX activity is performed , use a chromogenic assay or selected one - stage clotting assay validated for use with REBINYN [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
The one - stage clotting assay results can be significantly affected by the type of activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) reagent used , which can result in over - or under - estimation of Factor IX activity .
Avoid the use of silica - based reagents , as some may overestimate the activity of REBINYN .
If a validated one - stage clotting or chromogenic assay is not available locally , then use of a reference laboratory is recommended .
If bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose of REBINYN , or if the expected Factor IX activity levels in plasma are not attained , then perform a Bethesda assay to determine if Factor IX inhibitors are present .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 1 % ) in PTPs reported in clinical trials for REBINYN were itching and injection site reactions .
Common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 1 % ) in PUPs reported in clinical trials for REBINYN were rash , FIX inhibitors , hypersensitivity , itching , injection site reaction , and anaphylactic reaction .
The most frequently reported adverse reactions ( ≥ 1 % ) in previously treated patients ( PTPs ) and previously untreated patients ( PUPs ) were itching and injection site reactions ( 6 ) .
Additional frequently reported adverse reactions ( ≥ 1 % ) in PUPs included rash , Factor IX inhibition , hypersensitivity , and anaphylactic reaction ( 6 ) .
In animals administered repeat doses of REBINYN , accumulation of polyethylene - glycol ( PEG ) was observed in the choroid plexus , pituitary , circumventricular organs , and cranial motor neurons ( 8 . 4 and 13 . 2 ) .
The potential clinical implications of these animal findings are unknown ( 6 . 3 ) .
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Novo Nordisk Inc . at 1 - 877 - 668 - 6777 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Previously Treated Patients ( PTPs ) In five multicenter , prospective , non - controlled , open - label clinical trials , 115 PTPs [ 0 to 6 years old : 12 subjects ( 10 % ) ; 7 to 12 years old : 13 subjects ( 11 % ) ; 13 to 17 years old : 18 subjects ( 16 % ) ; ≥ 18 years old : 72 subjects ( 63 % ) ] received at least one dose of REBINYN as part of routine prophylaxis , on - demand treatment of bleeding episodes , perioperative management of major and minor surgery , or pharmacokinetic evaluation [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
A PTP was defined as a subject with a history of at least 150 exposure days to other Factor IX products ( adolescent / adult subjects ) or 50 exposure days to other Factor IX products ( pediatric subjects ) , and no history of inhibitors .
A total of 15 , 167 injections were administered over a median of 733 days ( range : 29 - 2951 days ) , equivalent to 15 , 137 exposure days and 292 patient - years .
Adverse reactions in PTPs are listed in Table 3 .
• Table 3 : Summary of Adverse Reactions in Previously Treated Patients System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Number of subjects ( % ) N = 115 General disorders and administration site conditions Injection site reactions 4 ( 4 ) Immune system disorders Hypersensitivity 1 ( 1 ) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Itching 3 ( 3 ) Previously Untreated Patients ( PUPs ) In one multicenter , prospective , non - controlled , open - label clinical trial conducted in PUPs , 50 subjects ( ≤ 6 years of age ) received at least one dose of REBINYN [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
A PUP was defined as a subject previously untreated or exposed to FIX - containing products less than or equal to 3 exposure days ( 5 previous exposures to blood components was acceptable ) .
A total of 6 , 737 injections were administered over a median of 996 days ( range : 61 - 2 , 233 days ) , equivalent to 6 , 709 exposure days and 142 patient - years .
Adverse reactions in PUPs are listed in Table 4 .
Table 4 : Summary of Adverse Reactions in Previously Untreated Patients System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Number of subjects ( % ) N = 50 Blood and lymphatic system disorders Factor IX inhibition 4 ( 8 ) General disorders and administration site conditions Injection site reaction 1 ( 2 ) Immune system disorders Anaphylactic reaction Hypersensitivty 1 ( 2 ) 3 ( 6 ) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash Itching 9 ( 18 ) 2 ( 4 ) 6 . 2 Immunogenicity Subjects were monitored for inhibitory antibodies to factor IX prior to dosing , on a monthly basis for the first three months , every two months up to one year , every three months for an additional year , and then every 6 months until end of trial .
No inhibitors were reported in the clinical trials in previously treated patients .
In an ongoing trial in previously untreated patients , one anaphylactic reaction has occurred with development of a factor IX inhibitor following treatment with REBINYN .
Inhibitor development and anaphylactic reactions are more likely to occur during the early phases of factor IX replacement therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
6 . 3 Neurologic Considerations Animals administered repeat doses of REBINYN showed accumulation of PEG in the choroid plexus , pituitary , circumventricular organs , and cranial motor neurons [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) and Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
The potential clinical implications of these animal findings are unknown .
In the pediatric studies , 47 PUPs and 25 PTPs receiving routine prophylaxis with REBINYN at a weekly dose of 40 IU / kg were followed for central nervous system ( CNS ) - related ADRs for 6 and 8 years , respectively .
The median duration of follow up of ADRs in the PUP and PTP studies were 2 and 7 years , respectively .
Furthermore , neurological examinations were prospectively conducted in 44 PUPs and 17 PTPs with a median follow up of 2 years , and neurocognitive assessments were prospectively performed in 38 PUPs and 16 PTPs with a median follow up of 1 year .
Although no clear clinical implications of the animal findings are known and no clear clinical neurologic or neurocognitive safety signal has emerged , the physician should consider whether the patient is vulnerable to cognitive impairment , such as infants and children who have developing brains , and patients who are cognitively impaired .
Factors such as duration of use , cumulative dose , age of the patient and co - morbidities that may increase risk of adverse neurologic and / or neurocognitive events should be considered when prescribing REBINYN .
Report adverse neurocognitive and neurologic reactions .
6 . 4 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of REBINYN .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Factor IX inhibitor development .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use : No dose adjustment is needed ( 8 . 4 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no data with REBINYN use in pregnant women to determine whether there is a drug - associated risk .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with REBINYN .
It is unknown whether REBINYN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect fertility .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of REBINYN in human milk , the effect on the breastfed infant , and the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for REBINYN and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from REBINYN or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of REBINYN were evaluated in four clinical trials that included 43 PTPs and in one clinical trial that included 50 pediatric PUPs [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Twelve of these subjects were ≤ 6 years of age ; 13 subjects were 7 to 12 years of age ; and 18 subjects were 13 to 17 years of age .
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated for 28 of the pediatric PTPs who were treated with REBINYN 40 IU / kg [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Body weight - adjusted clearance was observed to be higher for pediatric subjects than for adult subjects .
However , in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was needed in pediatric subjects who received a fixed dose of 40 IU / kg every week for routine prophylaxis .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data A juvenile animal neurotoxicity study was conducted to evaluate the potential neurotoxicity of REBINYN when intravenously administered 120 - 1200 IU / kg / twice weekly in immature male rats from 3 to 13 weeks of age , followed by a 13 - week treatment - free period .
Accumulation of PEG was observed in the choroid plexus , pituitary , circumventricular organs , and the cranial motor neurons .
PEG levels in these tissues increased with dose and dose duration ( 10 weeks ) and remained detectable after the 13 - week treatment - free period .
Treatment - related PEG - positive vacuolated macrophages were observed in the pituitary .
The accumulation of PEG was not associated with neurobehavioral changes , fertility , or functional effects .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of REBINYN did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether or not they respond differently than younger subjects .
Animals administered repeat doses of REBINYN showed accumulation of PEG in the choroid plexus , pituitary , circumventricular organs , and cranial motor neurons .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) and Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
The potential clinical implications of these animal findings are unknown .
No adverse neurologic effects of PEG have been reported in adults exposed to REBINYN during clinical trials , however , use in older adults with baseline cognitive dysfunction has not been fully evaluated [ see Neurologic Considerations ( 6 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION REBINYN is a sterile , non - pyrogenic , white to off - white lyophilized powder for reconstitution with the provided histidine diluent for intravenous infusion .
After reconstitution , the solution appears as a clear and colorless to slightly yellow liquid , free from visible particles and contains the following excipients per mL : sodium chloride , 2 . 34 mg ; histidine , 3 . 10 mg ; sucrose , 10 mg ; mannitol , 25 mg ; polysorbate 80 , 0 . 05 mg .
REBINYN is available in single - dose vials containing the labeled amount of Factor IX activity , expressed in IU .
Each vial contains nominally 500 IU , 1000 IU , 2000 , or 3000 IU .
REBINYN potency is assigned using an in vitro , activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) - based , one - stage clotting assay calibrated against the World Health Organization ( WHO ) international standard for Factor IX concentrates .
REBINYN contains no preservatives .
REBINYN is a purified recombinant human Factor IX ( rFIX ) with a 40 kilodalton ( kDa ) polyethylene - glycol ( PEG ) conjugated to the protein .
The 40 kDa PEG group is selectively attached to specific - N - linked glycans in the rFIX activation peptide , with mono - PEGylated rFIX as the predominant form of REBINYN .
The rFIX protein in REBINYN consists of a gamma - carboxylated ( Gla ) domain , two EGF - like ( epidermal growth factor ) domains , an activation peptide ( which is cleaved off upon activation ) , and a protease domain .
Once activated , the resulting rFIX has structural and functional properties similar to those of endogenous activated Factor IX .
The primary amino acid sequence in REBINYN is identical to the Thr148 allelic form of human plasma - derived Factor IX and consists of 415 amino acids .
The average molecular weight of REBINYN is approximately 98 kDa and the molecular weight of the protein moiety alone is 56 kDa .
The nominal specific activity of REBINYN is 144 IU / mg protein .
REBINYN is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells .
No additives of human or animal origin are used in the cell culture , purification , conjugation , or formulation of REBINYN .
The rFIX protein is purified by a series of chromatographic steps , including an affinity chromatography step using a monoclonal antibody ( produced in CHO cells ) , to selectively isolate rFIX from the cell culture medium .
The production process includes two dedicated viral clearance steps , namely a detergent treatment step for inactivation and a 20 nm filtration step for removal of viruses .
The conjugation of the PEG - group is done by an enzymatic reaction during the purification process , followed by final purification of REBINYN .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Patients with hemophilia B are deficient in coagulation Factor IX , which is required for effective hemostasis .
Treatment with REBINYN temporarily replaces the missing coagulation Factor IX .
The Factor IX in REBINYN is conjugated to a 40 - kDa polyethylene glycol molecule , which slows down its removal from the blood circulation .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The administration of REBINYN increases plasma levels of Factor IX and can temporarily correct the coagulation defect in hemophilia B patients , as reflected by a decrease in aPTT .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameters of REBINYN were evaluated in previously treated subjects , including a subset of subjects in the adult / adolescent trial and all subjects in the main phase of the pediatric trial [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
PK samples were collected prior to dosing and at multiple time points up to 168 hours after dosing .
The analysis of plasma samples was conducted using the one - stage clotting assay .
Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters for adolescents and adults following once - weekly prophylactic treatment of REBINYN 40 IU / kg are shown in Table 5 .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic or genotoxic potential of REBINYN , or dedicated studies to determine the effects of REBINYN on fertility , have not been performed .
In a juvenile rat study ( 3 to 13 week old male rats ) , fertility was unaffected following 9 weeks of twice weekly administrations of up to 1200 IU / kg [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology REBINYN was intravenously administered in repeat - dose toxicity studies in adult immune - deficient rats ( 40 - 1200 IU / kg / week for 26 weeks ) , immune - competent monkeys ( 350 - 3750 IU / kg / week for 4 weeks ) , and juvenile immune - competent rats ( 120 ‑ 1200 IU / kg / twice weekly for 10 weeks ) .
Accumulation of PEG was detected in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus in the brain of the adult rats and monkeys .
This finding was not associated with morphological changes or abnormal clinical signs .
In juvenile rats , more comprehensive assessment of brain tissues demonstrated PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus , pituitary , circumventricular organs , and the cranial motor neurons [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Safety and efficacy of REBINYN was evaluated in five multicenter , non - controlled , open - label trials in on - demand treatment of bleeding episodes , perioperative management of major and minor surgery , and routine prophylaxis or pharmacokinetic evaluation in PTPs with hemophilia B ( Factor IX activity ≤ 2 % ) .
The efficacy evaluation included 105 PTPs [ 62 adults ( 18 to 65 years old ) , 18 adolescents ( 13 to 17 years old ) , and 25 children ( 1 to 12 years old ) ] .
• • Adult / adolescent trial : The trial included 74 adolescent and adult subjects .
There were two routine prophylaxis arms , with single - blind randomization to either 10 IU / kg or 40 IU / kg once - weekly for approximately 52 weeks , and an open - label on - demand treatment arm for approximately 28 weeks .
• • Surgery trial : The surgery trial included 13 adolescent and adult subjects who received one infusion of REBINYN 80 IU / kg on the day of surgery , and post - operatively received infusions of 40 IU / kg , at the investigator ’ s discretion , for up to 3 weeks after surgery .
• • Pediatric trial : The main phase of the pediatric trial included 25 PTPs ( 1 to 12 years old ) in which subjects received routine prophylaxis with REBINYN 40 IU / kg once weekly for approximately 52 weeks until 50 EDs were reached .
Treatment of Bleeding Episodes Previously Treated Patients A total of 250 bleeding episodes were reported in 45 out of 69 PTPs receiving either REBINYN 40 IU / kg prophylaxis or on - demand treatment in the clinical program .
Bleeding episodes were treated with REBINYN at 40 IU / kg for minor or moderate bleeds or 80 IU / kg for major bleeds , with additional doses of 40 IU / kg as needed .
The median dose to treat a bleeding episode was 42 IU / kg .
An overall assessment of efficacy was performed by the subject ( for home treatment ) or the study site investigator ( for treatment under medical supervision ) using a 4 - point scale of excellent , good , moderate , or poor .
The overall success rate ( defined as excellent or good ) for treatment of bleeding episodes was 95 % as shown in Table 9 .
The success rate and dose needed for treatment of bleeding episodes were independent of the location of the bleeding .
The success rate for treatment of bleeding episodes was also independent of whether the bleed was traumatic or spontaneous .
Table 9 : Treatment of Bleeding Episodes in PTPs Receiving Either 40 IU / kg Prophylaxis or On - Demand Treatment Treatment Prophylaxis with 40 IU / kg On - Demand Total New Bleeding Episodes 107 143 250 Efficacy assessment * Excellent or Good 101 ( 95 % ) 135 ( 95 % ) 236 ( 95 % ) Moderate or Poor 5 ( 5 % ) 7 ( 5 % ) 12 ( 5 % ) Number of injections to treat a bleeding episode 1 injection 100 ( 93 % ) 120 ( 84 % ) 220 ( 88 % ) 2 injections 5 ( 5 % ) 20 ( 14 % ) 25 ( 10 % ) > 2 injections 2 ( 2 % ) 3 ( 2 % ) 5 ( 2 % ) * Efficacy assessment was based on 248 evaluated bleeding episodes ( data missing for two bleeding episodes ) .
Efficacy was assessed according to a four - point scale using : Excellent : Abrupt pain relief and / or clear improvement in objective signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single injection ; Good : Noticeable pain relief and / or improvement in signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single injection ; Moderate : Probable or slight beneficial effect within the first 8 hours after the first injection but requiring more than one injection within 8 hours ; Poor : No improvement , or worsening of symptoms within 8 hours after the second of two injections .
Perioperative Management In the surgery trial , the efficacy analysis of REBINYN in perioperative management included 13 surgical procedures of which 9 were major and performed in 13 previously treated adolescent and adult patients .
The procedures included 9 orthopedic , 1 gastrointestinal and 3 in the oral cavity .
The hemostatic effect during surgery was evaluated on a four - point scale of excellent , good , moderate , or poor .
The intraoperative hemostatic effect was rated as excellent or good for the 13 surgeries , for a success rate of 100 % .
A pre - operative dose of 80 IU / kg REBINYN was effective , and no subjects required additional doses on the day of surgery .
The median number of additional 40 IU / kg doses in the post - operative period was 2 . 0 for Days 1 to 6 , 1 . 5 for Days 7 - 13 , and 3 . 0 for Days 1 to 13 .
The mean total consumption of REBINYN in the pre - and post - operative period was 241 IU / kg ( range : 81 to 460 IU / kg ) .
There was no unexpected postoperative bleeding .
Three additional major surgeries and 18 minor surgery procedures were evaluated in the extension trial for REBINYN in previously treated patients .
The hemostatic effect during major and minor surgery was confirmed with a success rate of 100 % .
Routine Prophylaxis Adult / Adolescent PTP Trial In the main phase of the adult / adolescent PTP trial , 29 subjects ( 13 to 65 years old ) received REBINYN 40 IU / kg once weekly for approximately 52 weeks .
The annualized bleeding rate for these subjects in the main phase is presented in Table 10 .
