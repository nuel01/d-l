6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data described below reflect exposure to BARHEMSYS in 1 , 166 patients treated in placebo - controlled trials .
748 of these patients received a dose of 5 mg for prevention of PONV ( of whom 572 received another antiemetic concomitantly ) and 418 patients received 10 mg for treatment of PONV [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 , 14 . 2 ) ] .
The mean age of the population was 49 years ( range 18 to 91 years ) , 87 % female , 80 % White / Caucasian , 9 % Black , and 1 % Asian .
Prevention of PONV Common adverse reactions reported in at least 2 % of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 5 mg and at a higher rate than placebo in Studies 1 and 2 for the prevention of PONV are shown in Table 1 .
Table 1 .
Common Adverse Reactions [ 1 ] in Adult Patients in Studies 1 and 2 of BARHEMSYS for Prevention of PONV BARHEMSYS 5 mg Placebo N = 748 N = 741 Chills 4 % 3 % Hypokalemia 4 % 2 % Procedural hypotension 3 % 2 % Abdominal distension 2 % 1 % [ 1 ] Reported in at least 2 % of patients treated with BARHEMSYS and at a higher rate than placebo Serum prolactin concentrations were measured in Study 1 where 5 % ( 9 / 176 ) of BARHEMSYS - treated patients vs 1 % ( 1 / 166 ) of placebo - treated patients had increased blood prolactin reported as an adverse reaction .
Serum prolactin concentrations increased from a mean of 10 ng / mL at baseline to 32 ng / mL after BARHEMSYS treatment in 112 females ( upper limit of normal 29 ng / mL ) and from 10 ng / mL to 19 ng / mL in 61 males ( upper limit of normal 18 ng / mL ) .
No clinical consequences due to elevated prolactin levels were reported .
Treatment of PONV The most common adverse reaction , reported in at least 2 % of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 10 mg ( N = 418 ) and at a higher rate than placebo ( N = 416 ) , in clinical trials for the treatment of PONV ( Studies 3 and 4 ) was infusion site pain ( BARHEMSYS 6 % ; placebo 4 % ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval chronic oral use of amisulpride outside of the United States ( BARHEMSYS is not approved for oral dosing or chronic use ) .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Blood and lymphatic system disorders : agranulocytosis • Cardiac disorders : bradycardia , torsades de pointes , ventricular tachycardia , prolonged QT by electrocardiogram • General disorders : neuroleptic malignant syndrome • Immune system disorders : angioedema , hypersensitivity , urticaria • Hepatic disorders : increased hepatic enzymes • Nervous system disorders : agitation , anxiety , dystonia , extrapyramidal disorder , seizure • Psychiatric disorders : confusional state , insomnia , somnolence • Vascular disorders : hypotension 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Dopamine Agonists Reciprocal antagonism of effects occurs between dopamine agonists ( e . g . , levodopa ) and BARHEMSYS .
Avoid using levodopa with BARHEMSYS .
7 . 2 Drugs Prolonging the QT Interval BARHEMSYS causes dose - and concentration - dependent QT prolongation [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
To avoid potential additive effects , avoid use of BARHEMSYS in patients taking droperidol .
ECG monitoring is recommended in patients taking other drugs known to prolong the QT interval ( e . g . , ondansetron ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : A lactating woman may pump and discard breast milk for 48 hours after BARHEMSYS administration .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with amisulpride use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , there were no adverse developmental effects observed with oral administration of amisulpride in rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at exposures about 43 and 645 times , respectively , the exposure delivered by the highest recommended human dose ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Reproduction studies of amisulpride were conducted in pregnant rats administered oral doses up to 160 mg / kg / day ( 43 times the exposure based on area under the curve ( AUC ) at the highest recommended dose of 10 mg ) throughout the period of organogenesis .
No adverse embryo - fetal developmental effects were observed at any dose level .
Maternal animals exhibited a dose - related decrease in overall mean body weight gain .
In rabbits administered amisulpride throughout the period of organogenesis , oral doses up to 210 mg / kg / day ( 645 times the exposure based on AUC at the highest recommended dose of 10 mg ) had no adverse developmental effects on the fetus .
Maternal animals exhibited reduced mean body weight gain at doses of 100 and 210 mg / kg / day and reduced food intake was observed at 210 mg / kg / day .
The pre - and post - natal developmental effects of amisulpride were assessed in rats administered oral doses of 60 , 100 or 160 mg / kg / day during the periods of organogenesis and lactation .
At 160 mg / kg / day ( 43 times the exposure based on AUC at the highest recommended dose of 10 mg ) , maternal animals exhibited a reduction in mean body weight gain and decrease in food intake during lactation .
Amisulpride had no effect on maternal pregnancy parameters , litter survival or pup growth , development or maturation at any dose tested .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on case reports in published literature , amisulpride is present in human milk at concentrations that are 11 - to 20 - fold higher than human plasma in patients taking multiple oral doses of amisulpride ( 200 to 400 mg / day ) .
The estimated infant daily dose ranged from 5 % to 11 % of the maternal dose .
There are ways to minimize drug exposure to a breastfed infant ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed child and no information on the effects of amisulpride on milk production .
The pharmacological action of amisulpride , a dopamine - 2 ( D2 ) receptor antagonist , may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels , which may lead to a reversible increase in maternal milk production [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for BARHEMSYS and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BARHEMSYS or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk for 48 hours after BARHEMSYS administration to minimize drug exposure to a breastfed infant .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility In animal fertility studies , administration of repeated doses of amisulpride over a 10 - day period to female rats resulted in infertility that was reversible [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients enrolled in controlled clinical trials who received BARHEMSYS 5 mg for prevention of PONV or 10 mg for treatment of PONV , 235 ( 17 % ) were 65 years of age and older , while 59 ( 4 % ) were 75 years of age and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
10 OVERDOSAGE Doses of oral amisulpride ( BARHEMSYS is not approved for oral dosing ) above 1200 mg / day have been associated with adverse reactions related to dopamine - 2 ( D2 ) antagonism , in particular : • cardiovascular adverse reactions ( e . g . , prolongation of the QT interval , torsades de pointes , bradycardia and hypotension ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• neuropsychiatric adverse reactions ( e . g . , sedation , coma , seizures , and dystonic and extrapyramidal reactions ) .
There is no specific antidote for amisulpride overdose .
Management includes cardiac monitoring and treatment of severe extrapyramidal symptoms .
Since amisulpride is weakly dialyzed , hemodialysis should not be used to eliminate the drug .
11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient of BARHEMSYS is amisulpride , a dopamine - 2 ( D2 ) receptor antagonist .
Its chemical name is 4 - Amino - N - [ ( 1 - ethyl - 2 - pyrrolidinyl ) methyl ] - 5 - ( ethylsulfonyl ) - o - anisamide .
It has the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] ( racemic ) The empirical formula is C17H27N3O4S representing a molecular weight of 369 . 48 .
Amisulpride is a white or almost white crystalline powder .
It is practically insoluble in water , sparingly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in methylene chloride , and has a melting point of around 126 ° C .
The compound is racemic and shows no optical rotation and is not hygroscopic .
No other polymorphs of amisulpride have been reported .
BARHEMSYS ( amisulpride ) injection is a clear , colorless , nonpyrogenic , sterile solution formulation of amisulpride 5 mg / 2 mL ( 2 . 5 mg / mL ) or 10 mg / 4 mL ( 2 . 5 mg / mL ) for intravenous infusion presented in a single - dose vial .
It has a pH of approximately 5 . 0 and the osmolality of the product is between 250 and 330 mOsmol / kg .
Each 2 mL vial of BARHEMSYS contains 5 mg of amisulpride ; 18 . 7 mg of citric acid monohydrate USP ; 3 . 6 mg of sodium chloride USP ; 32 . 64 mg of trisodium citrate dihydrate ; hydrochloric acid NF and sodium hydroxide NF as needed to adjust the pH ( 4 . 75 to 5 . 25 ) ; and Water for Injection USP to make up to volume .
Each 4 mL vial of BARHEMSYS contains 10 mg of amisulpride ; 37 . 4 mg of citric acid monohydrate USP ; 7 . 2 mg of sodium chloride USP ; 65 . 3 mg of trisodium citrate dihydrate ; hydrochloric acid NF and sodium hydroxide NF as needed to adjust the pH ( 4 . 75 to 5 . 25 ) ; and Water for Injection USP to make up to volume .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Amisulpride is a selective dopamine - 2 ( D2 ) and dopamine - 3 ( D3 ) receptor antagonist .
D2 receptors are located in the chemoreceptor trigger zone ( CTZ ) and respond to the dopamine released from the nerve endings .
Activation of CTZ relays stimuli to the vomiting center which is involved in emesis .
Studies in multiple species indicate that D3 receptors in the area postrema also play a role in emesis .
Studies conducted in ferrets have shown that amisulpride inhibits emesis caused by apomorphine , with an estimated ED50 of less than 1 mcg / kg , subcutaneously ; and inhibits cisplatin - induced emesis at 2 mg / kg and morphine - induced emesis at 3 to 6 mg / kg , when given intravenously .
Amisulpride has no appreciable affinity for any other receptor types apart from low affinities for 5 - HT2B and 5 - HT7 receptors .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology A significant exposure - response relationship was identified between amisulpride concentration and ΔΔQTcF .
In 40 healthy Caucasian and Japanese subjects , the maximum mean difference ( 95 % upper confidence bound ) in QTcF from placebo after baseline - correction ( ΔΔQTcF ) was 5 . 0 ( 7 . 1 ) milliseconds after a 2 - minute intravenous infusion of 5 mg BARHEMSYS and 23 . 4 ( 25 . 5 ) milliseconds after an 8 - minute intravenous infusion of 40 mg BARHEMSYS [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The recommended infusion rate is 1 to 2 minutes for 5 mg or 10 mg of BARHEMSYS [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics After an intravenous infusion , the peak plasma concentration of amisulpride is achieved at the end of the infusion period and the plasma concentration decreases to about 50 % of the peak value within approximately 15 minutes .
The AUC ( 0 - ∞ ) increases dose - proportionally in the dose range from 5 mg to 40 mg ( 4 - times the maximum recommended dose ) .
The following mean pharmacokinetic parameters of amisulpride were observed following a single 5 or 10 mg intravenous dose in adult healthy subjects and surgical patients .
Table 2 .
Summary of Key Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Amisulpride from Clinical Studies Single Dose Infusion Duration ( minutes ) Number of Subjects Mean ( SD ) Peak Plasma Concentration ( ng / mL ) AUC ( 0 - ∞ ) ( ng ∙ h / mL ) Healthy Subjects 5 mg 2 39 200 ( 139 ) 154 ( 30 ) Healthy Subjects 10 mg 1 29 451 ( 230 ) 136 ( 28 ) [ 1 ] Patients 5 mg 1 to 2 26 [ 2 ] 161 ( 58 ) 260 ( 65 ) 27 [ 3 ] 127 ( 64 ) 204 ( 94 ) Patients 10 mg 1 to 2 31 null 285 ( 446 ) 401 ( 149 ) [ 1 ] AUC ( 0 - 2 hr ) [ 2 ] Patients in a clinical trial for prophylaxis of PONV [ 3 ] Patients in clinical trials for treatment of PONV Distribution Following intravenous infusion , the mean volume of distribution of amisulpride is estimated to be 127 to 144 L in surgical patients and 171 L in healthy subjects .
Amisulpride distributes into erythrocytes .
Plasma protein binding is 25 % to 30 % in the concentration range from 37 to 1850 ng / mL .
Elimination The mean elimination half - life is approximately 4 to 5 hours and similar between healthy subjects and surgical patients .
Population pharmacokinetic analysis estimated that the plasma clearance of amisulpride is 20 . 6 L / h in surgical patients and 24 . 1 L / h in healthy subjects .
Metabolism In a mass balance study , no metabolites were detectable in plasma while four metabolites were identified in urine and feces .
Each metabolite accounts for less than 7 % of the dose .
In vitro amisulpride is not metabolized by major cytochrome P450 enzymes .
Excretion After intravenous administration of amisulpride , 74 % and 23 % of the administered dose was recovered in urine and feces , respectively .
58 % and 20 % of the dose was excreted as unchanged amisulpride in urine and feces , respectively .
Renal clearance was estimated to be 20 . 5 L / hr ( 342 mL / min ) in healthy subjects suggesting that amisulpride undergoes active renal secretion .
Specific Populations Age , Sex , and Racial Groups No clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amisulpride was observed based on age ( 18 to 90 years ) , sex , or race .
Patients with Renal Impairment In subjects with severe renal impairment ( eGFR < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) and no requirement for dialysis , the Cmax of amisulpride after a single 10 mg intravenous dose was not greater than that in healthy subjects with normal renal function , and the AUC ( 0 - ∞ ) was approximately twice as high .
In surgical patients with mild or moderate renal impairment ( eGFR 30 to 89 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , the Cmax of amisulpride following a single 5 mg or 10 mg intravenous dose was not significantly different and the AUC ( 0 - ∞ ) of amisulpride increased about 1 . 3 - fold compared to patients with normal renal function .
The changes in the pharmacokinetics of amisulpride following a single 5 mg or 10 mg intravenous dose in subjects or patients with mild , moderate , or severe renal impairment compared to subjects or patients with normal renal function are not considered to be clinically meaningful .
Drug Interaction Studies No clinical drug interaction trials have been conducted with BARHEMSYS .
In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 - Related Metabolism In vitro , amisulpride did not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , or CYP3A4 , or induce CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP3A4 .
In vitro , amisulpride was not a substrate of CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 .
Transporters Amisulpride inhibits MATE1 and MATE2 - K transporters .
Amisulpride does not inhibit P - gp , BCRP , OCT1 , OCT2 , OAT1 , OAT3 , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 at therapeutic concentrations .
Amisulpride is a substrate for P - gp , BCRP , OCT1 , MATE1 and MATE2 - K , but not a substrate for OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OAT1 , OAT3 and OCT2 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of amisulpride have not been conducted .
Amisulpride was not genotoxic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay , the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocytes assay , and the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay .
The effect of amisulpride on fertility was studied in rats at oral doses up to 160 mg / kg / day ( 43 times the exposure based on AUC at the highest recommended dose of 10 mg ) .
Most female animals ( 90 % to 95 % ) at each dose level remained in diestrus and failed to mate .
However , this effect on mating reversed following cessation of treatment .
No treatment - related effects were observed on uterine / implantation parameters or sperm counts , sperm motility or sperm morphology .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The efficacy of BARHEMSYS for the prevention of PONV was evaluated in two randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multi - center trials in patients undergoing general anesthesia and elective surgery ( Study 1 and Study 2 ) .
In Study 1 ( NCT01991860 ) , patients received monotherapy with BARHEMSYS ; while in Study 2 ( NCT02337062 ) , patients received BARHEMSYS in combination with one other intravenously administered , non - dopaminergic antiemetic ( ondansetron , dexamethasone or betamethasone ) .
In both trials , patients were administered BARHEMSYS at the induction of anesthesia .
Study 1 was conducted in the United States in 342 patients .
The mean age was 54 years ( range 21 to 88 years ) ; 65 % female ; 87 % White / Caucasian , 12 % Black , and 1 % Asian race .
The treatment groups were similarly matched in terms of risk for PONV with 30 % of patients having two risk factors , 47 % of patients having three risk factors and 23 % of patients having four risk factors .
Study 2 was conducted in the United States and Europe in 1 , 147 patients .
The mean age was 49 years ( range 18 to 91 years ) ; 97 % female ; 75 % White / Caucasian , 9 % Black , 1 % Asian , and 14 % of unreported race .
The treatment groups were similarly matched in terms of risk for PONV with 56 % of patients having three risk factors and 43 % of patients having four risk factors .
The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was Complete Response , defined as absence of any episode of emesis or use of rescue medication within the first 24 hours postoperatively .
Results for both trials are shown in Table 3 .

Study 3 ( NCT02449291 ) enrolled patients who had not received prior PONV prophylaxis , whereas Study 4 ( NCT02646566 ) included patients who had received and failed PONV prophylaxis with an antiemetic of another class .
Patients were excluded if they had received a D2 receptor antagonist antiemetic .
Study 3 was conducted in 369 patients ( mean age 47 years , range 19 to 82 years ; 76 % female ; 82 % White / Caucasian , 8 % Black , 2 % Asian , and 8 % of unreported race ) .
Most of the patients had either two risk factors ( 36 % ) or three risk factors ( 53 % ) for PONV and these percentages were similar between treatment groups .
Study 4 was conducted in 465 patients ( mean age 46 years , range 18 to 85 years ; 90 % female ; 82 % White / Caucasian , 9 % Black , 3 % Asian , and 6 % of unreported race ) .
Patients had received prior PONV prophylaxis with one or more non - dopaminergic antiemetics : a 5 - HT3 - antagonist in 77 % , dexamethasone in 65 % and another antiemetic class in 10 % .
Most of the patients had either three risk factors ( 43 % ) or four risk factors ( 51 % ) for PONV and these percentages were similar between treatment groups .
For both trials , the primary efficacy endpoint was Complete Response defined as absence of any episode of emesis or use of rescue medication within the first 24 hours after treatment ( excluding emesis within the first 30 minutes ) .
