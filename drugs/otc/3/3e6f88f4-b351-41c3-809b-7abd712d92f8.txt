Administer the dose as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to myelosuppressive doses of radiation .
( 2 . 2 ) • See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution , preparation , and administration .
( 2 . 3 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 . 1 Patients with Immune Thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) Use the lowest dose of Nplate to achieve and maintain a platelet count ≥ 50 × 109 / L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding .
Administer Nplate as a weekly subcutaneous injection with dose adjustments based upon the platelet count response .
The prescribed Nplate dose may consist of a very small volume ( e . g . , 0 . 15 mL ) .
Administer Nplate only with a syringe that contains 0 . 01 mL graduations .
Discontinue Nplate if the platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after 4 weeks of Nplate therapy at the maximum weekly dose of 10 mcg / kg [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Obtain complete blood counts ( CBCs ) , including platelet counts , weekly during the dose adjustment phase of Nplate therapy and then monthly following establishment of a stable Nplate dose .
Obtain CBCs , including platelet counts , weekly for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of Nplate .
For Adult Patients with ITP The initial dose of Nplate is 1 mcg / kg .
Actual body weight at initiation of treatment should always be used when calculating the initial dose .
In adults , future dose adjustments are based on changes in platelet counts only .
Adjust the weekly dose of Nplate by increments of 1 mcg / kg until the patient achieves a platelet count ≥ 50 × 109 / L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding ; do not exceed a maximum weekly dose of 10 mcg / kg .
In clinical studies , most adult patients who responded to Nplate achieved and maintained platelet counts ≥ 50 × 109 / L with a median dose of 2 - 3 mcg / kg .
Adjust the dose as follows for adult patients : • If the platelet count is < 50 × 109 / L , increase the dose by 1 mcg / kg .
• If platelet count is > 200 × 109 / L and ≤ 400 × 109 / L for 2 consecutive weeks , reduce the dose by 1 mcg / kg .
• If platelet count is > 400 × 109 / L , do not dose .
Continue to assess the platelet count weekly .
After the platelet count has fallen to < 200 × 109 / L , resume Nplate at a dose reduced by 1 mcg / kg .
For Pediatric Patients with ITP The initial dose of Nplate is 1 mcg / kg .
Actual body weight at initiation of treatment should always be used when calculating initial dose .
In pediatric patients , future dose adjustments are based on changes in platelet counts and changes in body weight .
Reassessment of body weight is recommended every 12 weeks .
Adjust the weekly dose of Nplate by increments of 1 mcg / kg until the patient achieves a platelet count ≥ 50 × 109 / L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding ; do not exceed a maximum weekly dose of 10 mcg / kg .
In a pediatric placebo - controlled clinical study , the median of the most frequent dose of Nplate received by patients during weeks 17 through 24 was 5 . 5 mcg / kg .
Adjust the dose as follows for pediatric patients : • If the platelet count is < 50 × 109 / L , increase the dose by 1 mcg / kg .
• If platelet count is > 200 × 109 / L and ≤ 400 × 109 / L for 2 consecutive weeks , reduce the dose by 1 mcg / kg .
• If platelet count is > 400 × 109 / L , do not dose .
Continue to assess the platelet count weekly .
After the platelet count has fallen to < 200 × 109 / L , resume Nplate at a dose reduced by 1 mcg / kg .
2 . 2 Patients with Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome For Adult and Pediatric Patients ( including term neonates ) The recommended dose of Nplate is 10 mcg / kg administered once as a subcutaneous injection .
Administer the dose as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to radiation levels greater than 2 gray ( Gy ) .
Administer Nplate regardless of whether a complete blood count ( CBC ) can be obtained .
Estimate a patient ' s absorbed whole body radiation dose ( i . e . , level of radiation exposure ) based on information from public health authorities , biodosimetry if available , or clinical findings such as time to onset of vomiting or lymphocyte depletion kinetics .
2 . 3 Preparation and Administration To mitigate against medication errors ( both overdose and underdose ) , ensure that these preparation and administration instructions are followed .
Use aseptic technique .
Only administer subcutaneously [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
Nplate is supplied in single - dose vials as a sterile , preservative - free , white lyophilized powder that must be reconstituted as outlined in Table 1 and administered using a syringe with 0 . 01 mL graduations .
Calculation of Patient Dose Multiply the patient ’ s weight ( kg ) by the prescribed dose to obtain the Calculated Patient Dose .
Calculated Patient Dose ( mcg ) = Weight ( kg ) × Prescribed dose ( mcg / kg ) Reconstitution and Dilution of Nplate Single - Dose Vials [ MULTIMEDIA ] Reconstitute Nplate with Sterile Water for Injection , USP .
Do not reconstitute or dilute with Bacteriostatic Water for Injection , USP or dilute with Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
If the Calculated Patient Dose is less than 23 mcg , dilution with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP is required to reduce the concentration of Nplate ( see Table 1 ) .
This reduced concentration allows for low - doses to be accurately calculated , and consistently measured with a 0 . 01 mL graduated syringe .

3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS For injection : 125 mcg , 250 mcg or 500 mcg of Nplate as a sterile , lyophilized , solid white powder in single - dose vials .
• For injection : 125 mcg , 250 mcg or 500 mcg of romiplostim as a lyophilized powder in single - dose vials .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None .
None ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • In some patients with MDS , Nplate increases blast cell counts and increases the risk of progression to acute myelogenous leukemia .
( 5 . 1 ) • Thrombotic / thromboembolic complications may result from increases in platelet counts with Nplate use .
Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease receiving Nplate .
( 5 . 2 ) • If severe thrombocytopenia develops during Nplate treatment , assess patients for the formation of neutralizing antibodies .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Progression of Myelodysplastic Syndromes to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Progression from myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) to acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) has been observed in adult clinical trials with Nplate .
A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial enrolling adult patients with severe thrombocytopenia and International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) low or intermediate - 1 risk MDS was terminated due to more cases of AML observed in the Nplate arm .
This trial consisted of a 58 - week study period with a 5 - year long - term follow - up phase .
The patients were randomized 2 : 1 to treatment with Nplate or placebo ( 167 Nplate , 83 placebo ) .
During the 58 - week study period , progression to AML occurred in 10 ( 6 . 0 % ) patients in the Nplate arm and 4 ( 4 . 8 % ) patients in the placebo arm ( hazard ratio [ 95 % CI ] = 1 . 20 [ 0 . 38 , 3 . 84 ] ) .
Of the 250 patients , 210 ( 84 . 0 % ) entered the long - term follow - up phase of this study .
With 5 - years of follow - up , 29 ( 11 . 6 % ) patients showed progression to AML , including 20 / 168 ( 11 . 9 % ) patients in the Nplate arm versus 9 / 82 ( 11 . 0 % ) patients in the placebo arm ( HR [ 95 % CI ] = 1 . 06 [ 0 . 48 , 2 . 33 ] ) .
The incidence of death ( overall survival ) was 55 . 7 % ( 93 / 167 ) in the Nplate arm versus 54 . 2 % ( 45 / 83 ) in the placebo arm ( HR [ 95 % CI ] = 1 . 03 [ 0 . 72 , 1 . 47 ] ) .
In the baseline low IPSS group , there was a higher incidence of death in the Nplate arm [ 41 . 3 % ( 19 / 46 ) ] compared to the placebo arm [ 30 . 4 % ( 7 / 23 ) ] ( HR [ 95 % CI ] = 1 . 59 [ 0 . 67 , 3 . 80 ] ) .
In a single - arm trial of Nplate given to 72 patients with thrombocytopenia - related MDS , 8 ( 11 . 1 % ) patients were reported as having possible disease progression , of which 3 ( 4 . 2 % ) had confirmation of AML during follow - up .
In addition , in 3 ( 4 . 2 % ) patients , increased peripheral blood blast cell counts decreased to baseline after discontinuation of Nplate .
Nplate is not indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS or any cause of thrombocytopenia other than ITP .
5 . 2 Thrombotic / Thromboembolic Complications Thrombotic / thromboembolic complications may result from increases in platelet counts with Nplate use secondary to drug - induced thrombocytosis , regardless of the underlying disease .
There is insufficient evidence to establish a relationship between maximum platelet threshold and risk of thrombotic / thromboembolic complications .
Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease receiving Nplate .
In patients with ITP , to minimize the risk for thrombotic / thromboembolic complications , do not use Nplate in an attempt to normalize platelet counts .
Follow the dose adjustment guidelines [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
In the absence of myelosuppression induced by acute exposure to radiation , Nplate administration might cause excessive increases in platelet counts and may cause thrombotic and thromboembolic complications [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 3 Loss of Response to Nplate Hyporesponsiveness or failure to maintain a platelet response with Nplate should prompt a search for causative factors , including neutralizing antibodies to Nplate [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 3 ) ] .
To detect antibody formation , submit blood samples to Amgen ( 1 - 800 - 772 - 6436 ) .
Amgen will assay these samples for antibodies to Nplate and thrombopoietin ( TPO ) .
Discontinue Nplate if the platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after 4 weeks at the highest weekly dose of 10 mcg / kg .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections : • Progression of Myelodysplastic Syndromes [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Thrombotic / Thromboembolic Complications [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Loss of Response to Nplate [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • In adult patients , the most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % higher patient incidence in Nplate versus placebo ) are arthralgia , dizziness , insomnia , myalgia , pain in extremity , abdominal pain , shoulder pain , dyspepsia , and paresthesia .
Headache was the most commonly reported adverse reaction that did not occur at ≥ 5 % higher patient incidence in Nplate versus placebo .
( 6 . 1 ) • In pediatric patients , the most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 25 % ) are : contusion , upper respiratory tract infection , and oropharyngeal pain .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adults The data described below reflect Nplate exposure to 271 adult patients with ITP , aged 18 to 88 , of whom 62 % were female .
Nplate was studied in two randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind studies that were identical in design , with the exception that Study 1 evaluated nonsplenectomized patients with ITP and Study 2 evaluated splenectomized patients with ITP .
Data are also reported from an open - label , single - arm study in which patients received Nplate over an extended period of time .
Overall , Nplate was administered to 114 patients for at least 52 weeks and 53 patients for at least 96 weeks .
In the placebo - controlled studies , headache was the most commonly reported adverse drug reaction , occurring in 35 % of patients receiving Nplate and 32 % of patients receiving placebo .
For those patients receiving Nplate , 14 ( 48 % ) of headaches were mild , 9 ( 31 % ) were moderate , and 6 ( 21 % ) were severe .
Table 3 presents adverse drug reactions from Studies 1 and 2 with a ≥ 5 % higher patient incidence in Nplate versus placebo .
Table 3 .
Adverse Reactions Identified in Two Placebo - Controlled StudiesAdverse Reactions by Body System Nplate ( % ) ( n = 84 ) Placebo ( % ) ( n = 41 ) Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia 22 ( 26 % ) 8 ( 20 % ) Myalgia 12 ( 14 % ) 1 ( 2 % ) Pain in Extremity 11 ( 13 % ) 2 ( 5 % ) Shoulder Pain 7 ( 8 % ) 0 Nervous System Disorders Dizziness 14 ( 17 % ) 0 Paresthesia 5 ( 6 % ) 0 Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia 13 ( 16 % ) 3 ( 7 % ) Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal pain 9 ( 11 % ) 0 Dyspepsia 6 ( 7 % ) 0 MedDRA version 9 is used .
Among 291 adult patients with ITP who received Nplate in the single - arm extension study , the incidence rates of the adverse reactions occurred in a pattern similar to those reported in the placebo - controlled clinical studies .
The safety profile of Nplate was similar across patients , regardless of ITP duration .
The following adverse reactions ( at least 5 % incidence and at least 5 % more frequent with Nplate compared with placebo or standard of care ) occurred in Nplate patients with ITP duration up to 12 months : bronchitis , sinusitis , vomiting , arthralgia , myalgia , headache , dizziness , diarrhea , upper respiratory tract infection , cough , nausea and oropharyngeal pain .
The adverse reaction of thrombocytosis occurred with an incidence of 2 % in adults with ITP duration up to 12 months .
Bone Marrow Reticulin Formation and Collagen Fibrosis Nplate administration may increase the risk for development or progression of reticulin fiber formation within the bone marrow .
This formation may improve upon discontinuation of Nplate .
In a clinical trial , one patient with ITP and hemolytic anemia developed marrow fibrosis with collagen during Nplate therapy .
An open - label clinical trial prospectively evaluated changes in bone marrow reticulin formation and collagen fibrosis in adult patients with ITP treated with Nplate or a non - US approved romiplostim product .
Patients were administered romiplostim by SC injection once weekly for up to 3 years .
Based on cohort assignment at time of study enrollment , patients were evaluated for bone marrow reticulin and collagen at year 1 ( cohort 1 ) , year 2 ( cohort 2 ) , or year 3 ( cohort 3 ) in comparison to the baseline bone marrow at start of the trial .
Patients were evaluated for bone marrow reticulin formation and collagen fibrosis using the modified Bauermeister grading scale .
From the total of 169 patients enrolled in the 3 cohorts , 132 ( 78 % ) patients were evaluable for bone marrow collagen fibrosis and 131 ( 78 % ) patients were evaluable for bone marrow reticulin formation .
Two percent ( 2 / 132 ) of patients ( both from cohort 3 ) developed Grade 4 findings ( presence of collagen ) .
There was no detectable bone marrow collagen in one patient on repeat testing 12 weeks after discontinuation of romiplostim .
Progression of bone marrow reticulin formation ( increase greater than or equal to 2 grades or more ) or an increase to Grade 4 ( presence of collagen ) was reported in 7 % ( 9 / 131 ) of patients .
Pediatric Patients The data described below reflect median exposure to Nplate of 168 days for 59 pediatric patients ( aged 1 to 17 years ) with ITP for at least 6 months , of whom 47 . 5 % were female , across the randomized phase of two placebo - controlled trials .
Table 4 presents the most common adverse reactions experienced by at least 5 % of the pediatric patients ( 1 year and older ) receiving Nplate across the two placebo - controlled trials with at least a 5 % higher incidence in patients who received Nplate compared to those who received placebo .
Table 4 .
Common Adverse Reactions ( ≥ 5 % Incidence and ≥ 5 % More Frequent on the Nplate Arm ) from Two Placebo - Controlled Trials in Pediatric Patients with ITP for at least 6 months MedDRA version 20 . 1 is used .
In pediatric patients of age ≥ 1 year receiving Nplate for ITP , adverse reactions with an incidence of ≥ 25 % in the two randomized trials were : contusion ( 41 % ) , upper respiratory tract infection ( 31 % ) , and oropharyngeal pain ( 25 % ) .
Adverse Reactions by Body System Nplate ( % ) ( N = 59 ) Placebo ( % ) ( N = 24 ) Infections and Infestations Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 18 ( 31 % ) 6 ( 25 % ) Ear Infection 3 ( 5 % ) 0 Gastroenteritis 3 ( 5 % ) 0 Sinusitis 3 ( 5 % ) 0 Respiratory , Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Oropharyngeal Pain 15 ( 25 % ) 1 ( 4 % ) Gastrointestinal Disorders Diarrhea 12 ( 20 % ) 3 ( 13 % ) Abdominal Pain Upper 8 ( 14 % ) 1 ( 4 % ) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash 9 ( 15 % ) 2 ( 8 % ) Purpura 4 ( 7 % ) 0 Urticaria 3 ( 5 % ) 0 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Pyrexia 14 ( 24 % ) 2 ( 8 % ) Peripheral Swelling 4 ( 7 % ) 0 Injury , Poisoning and Procedural Complications Contusion 24 ( 41 % ) 8 ( 33 % ) Among 203 pediatric patients with ITP who received Nplate in a single arm , open - label , long - term ( median duration of 3 years on therapy ) study , the incidence rates of the adverse reactions occurred in a pattern similar to those reported in the placebo - controlled clinical studies .
In this single arm , open - label , long - term study , headache occurred in 78 patients ( 38 % ) , 3 % ( n = 6 ) being severe and 1 % ( n = 2 ) resulting in discontinuation of drug .
Bone Marrow Reticulin Formation and Collagen Fibrosis The open - label long - term study also evaluated changes in bone marrow reticulin and collagen formation .
The modified Bauermeister grading scale was used for both assessments .
Based on cohort assignment at the time of study enrollment , patients were evaluated for bone marrow reticulin and collagen at year 1 ( cohort 1 ) or year 2 ( cohort 2 ) in comparison to the baseline bone marrow at the start of the study .
From the total of 79 patients enrolled in the 2 cohorts , 27 ( 90 % ) patients in cohort 1 and 36 ( 73 . 5 % ) patients in cohort 2 had evaluable on - study bone marrow biopsies .
Increased reticulin fiber formation was reported for 18 . 5 % ( 5 of 27 ) of patients in cohort 1 and 47 . 2 % ( 17 of 36 ) of patients in cohort 2 , with a maximum grade of 2 .
No patients in either cohort developed collagen fibrosis ( defined as grade 4 ) or a bone marrow abnormality that was inconsistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Nplate .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Erythromelalgia • Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema and anaphylaxis 6 . 3 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Nplate in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
Patients were screened for immunogenicity to romiplostim using a BIAcore - based biosensor immunoassay .
This assay is capable of detecting both high - and low - affinity binding antibodies that bind to romiplostim and cross - react with TPO .
The samples from patients that tested positive for binding antibodies were further evaluated for neutralizing capacity using a cell - based bioassay .
In adult clinical studies in adult patients with ITP , the incidence of pre - existing antibodies to romiplostim was 3 . 3 % ( 35 / 1046 ) and the incidence of binding antibody development during treatment with Nplate or a non - US approved romiplostim product was 5 . 7 % ( 60 / 1046 ) .
The incidence of pre - existing antibodies to endogenous TPO was 3 % ( 31 / 1046 ) and the incidence of binding antibody development to endogenous TPO during treatment was 3 . 2 % ( 33 / 1046 ) .
Of the patients with positive binding antibodies that developed to romiplostim or to TPO , four patients had neutralizing activity to romiplostim and none had neutralizing activity to TPO .
No apparent correlation was observed between antibody activity and clinical effectiveness or safety .
In pediatric studies , data on antibody formation was collected from 282 patients ( 20 from early phase studies , 59 from phase 3 studies with duration of 6 months and 203 from a long - term study with median duration of 3 years ) .
The incidence of binding antibodies to Nplate at any time was 9 . 6 % ( 27 / 282 ) , of which 2 patients ( 0 . 7 % ) had pre - existing binding non - neutralizing Nplate antibodies at baseline and 11 patients ( 3 . 9 % ) had persistent binding antibody positivity at end of study .
Additionally , 2 . 8 % ( 8 / 282 ) developed neutralizing antibodies to Nplate , with 4 patients ( 1 . 4 % ) having persistent neutralizing antibody positivity at end of study , despite discontinuation of Nplate .
The incidence of binding antibodies to TPO at any time was 3 . 9 % ( 11 / 282 ) , of which 2 patients ( 0 . 7 % ) had pre - existing binding non - neutralizing antibodies to TPO at baseline and 1 patient ( 0 . 4 % ) had binding persistent antibody positivity at end of study .
One patient ( 0 . 4 % ) had a weakly positive postbaseline result for neutralizing antibodies against TPO while on study ( with positive non - neutralizing antibodies to Nplate ) with a negative result at baseline for both antibodies .
The patient showed a transient antibody response for neutralizing antibodies against TPO , with a negative result at the patient ' s last timepoint tested within the study period after discontinuation of Nplate .
A postmarketing registry study involving patients with thrombocytopenia on Nplate or a non - US approved romiplostim product was conducted to assess the long - term consequences of the anti - romiplostim antibodies .
Adult patients who lacked response or lost response to Nplate or a non - US approved romiplostim product were enrolled .
The incidence of new binding antibody development was 3 . 8 % ( 7 / 184 ) to romiplostim and 2 . 2 % ( 4 / 184 ) were positive for binding , non - neutralizing antibodies to TPO ; two patients were positive for binding antibodies to both romiplostim and TPO .
Of the seven patients with positive binding antibodies to romiplostim , one patient ( 0 . 5 % ; 1 / 184 ) was positive for neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim only .
Nineteen confirmed pediatric patients were included in the postmarketing registry study .
The incidence of binding antibody post treatment was 16 % ( 3 / 19 ) to romiplostim , of which 5 . 3 % ( 1 / 19 ) were positive for neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim .
There were no antibodies detected to TPO .
Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay used in detection and may be influenced by several factors , including sample handling , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of incidence of antibodies to romiplostim with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nplate may be used with other medical ITP therapies , such as corticosteroids , danazol , azathioprine , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) , and anti - D immunoglobulin [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal reproduction studies , Nplate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Available data with Nplate use in pregnant women are insufficient to draw conclusions about any drug - associated risk for major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies , romiplostim crossed the placenta , and adverse fetal effects included thrombocytosis , postimplantation loss , and an increase in pup mortality ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In rat and rabbit embryo - fetal development toxicity studies , no evidence of fetal harm was observed at romiplostim doses up to 11 times ( rats ) and 82 times ( rabbits ) the maximum human dose ( MHD ) based on systemic exposure ( AUC ) .
In mice at doses 5 times the MHD , reductions in maternal body weight and increased postimplantation loss occurred .
In a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats , at doses 11 times the MHD , there was an increase in perinatal pup mortality .
Romiplostim crossed the placental barrier in rats and increased fetal platelet counts at clinically equivalent and higher doses .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of romiplostim in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk .
The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed child to romiplostim are unknown .
Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from Nplate , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Nplate .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have been established in pediatric patients age 1 year and older with ITP for at least 6 months evaluated in two randomized , placebo - controlled studies .
Long - term safety in the same population using Nplate for a median duration of 3 years was also evaluated in a single arm , open - label study [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of romiplostim have been evaluated in pediatric patients 1 year and older with ITP [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) for dosing recommendations for pediatric patients 1 year and older .
The safety and efficacy of Nplate in pediatric patients younger than 1 year with ITP have not been established .
Serum concentrations of romiplostim in pediatric patients with ITP were within the range observed in adult patients with ITP receiving the same dose range of romiplostim .
The use of Nplate to increase survival in pediatric patients ( including term neonates ) acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation is based on efficacy studies conducted in adult animals .
Efficacy studies of Nplate could not be conducted in humans with acute radiation syndrome for ethical and feasibility reasons .
A similar response to romiplostim is expected in the pediatric and adult patients based on the mechanism of action of the drug and pharmacokinetics of romiplostim in pediatric patients 1 year and older with ITP [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 271 patients who received Nplate in ITP clinical studies , 55 ( 20 % ) were age 65 and over , and 27 ( 10 % ) were 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or efficacy have been observed between older and younger patients in the placebo - controlled studies , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
In general , dose adjustment for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdoses due to medication errors have been reported in patients receiving Nplate .
In the event of overdose , platelet counts may increase excessively and result in thrombotic / thromboembolic complications .
In this case , discontinue Nplate and monitor platelet counts .
Reinitiate treatment with Nplate in accordance with dosing and administration recommendations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Romiplostim is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist ( TPO - RA ) .
Romiplostim , a member of the TPO mimetic class , is an Fc - peptide fusion protein ( peptibody ) .
The peptibody molecule contains two identical single - chain subunits , each consisting of human immunoglobulin IgG1 Fc domain , covalently linked at the C - terminus to a peptide containing two thrombopoietin receptor - binding domains .
Romiplostim has no amino acid sequence homology to endogenous TPO .
Romiplostim is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) .
Nplate ( romiplostim ) for injection is supplied as a sterile , preservative - free , lyophilized , solid white powder for subcutaneous use .
Nplate is supplied as either 125 mcg per vial , 250 mcg per vial or 500 mcg per vial of romiplostim and requires reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection to obtain a concentration of 500 mcg / mL .
Each single - dose 125 mcg vial of Nplate contains the following : 125 mcg of romiplostim , L - histidine ( 0 . 7 mg ) , mannitol ( 18 mg ) , polysorbate 20 ( 0 . 02 mg ) , sucrose ( 9 mg ) , and sufficient HCl to adjust the pH to a target of 5 .
Reconstitution with 0 . 44 mL of Sterile Water for Injection provides a resulting concentration of 125 mcg / 0 . 25 mL .
Each single - dose 250 mcg vial of Nplate contains the following : 250 mcg romiplostim , L - histidine ( 1 . 2 mg ) , mannitol ( 30 mg ) , polysorbate 20 ( 0 . 03 mg ) , sucrose ( 15 mg ) , and sufficient HCl to adjust the pH to a target of 5 .
Reconstitution with 0 . 72 mL of Sterile Water for Injection provides a resulting concentration of 250 mcg / 0 . 5 mL .
Each single - dose 500 mcg vial of Nplate contains the following : 500 mcg romiplostim , L - histidine ( 1 . 9 mg ) , mannitol ( 50 mg ) , polysorbate 20 ( 0 . 05 mg ) , sucrose ( 25 mg ) , and sufficient HCl to adjust the pH to a target of 5 .
Reconstitution with 1 . 2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection provides a resulting concentration of 500 mcg / mL .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Nplate increases platelet production through binding and activation of the TPO receptor , a mechanism analogous to endogenous TPO .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies , treatment with Nplate resulted in dose - dependent increases in platelet counts .
After a single subcutaneous dose of 1 to 10 mcg / kg Nplate in patients with ITP , the peak platelet count was 1 . 3 to 14 . 9 times greater than the baseline platelet count over a 2 - to 3 - week period .
The platelet counts were above 50 × 109 / L for seven out of eight patients with ITP who received six weekly doses of Nplate at 1 mcg / kg .
In a clinical study , peak platelet count increased 4 . 7 to 7 . 3 fold ( mean : 5 . 8 fold ) above baseline values in healthy adults ( n = 4 ) administered a single 10 mcg / kg IV dose of Nplate .
Results from population modeling and simulation indicate that a single 10 mcg / kg subcutaneous dose of Nplate would result in clinically relevant effects on incidence rate and duration of severe thrombocytopenia in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Patients with Immune Thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) In the long - term extension study in adult patients with ITP receiving weekly treatment of Nplate subcutaneously , the pharmacokinetics of romiplostim over the dose range of 3 to 15 mcg / kg indicated that peak serum concentrations of romiplostim were observed about 7 to 50 hours post dose ( median : 14 hours ) with half - life values ranging from 1 to 34 days ( median : 3 . 5 days ) .
The serum concentrations varied among patients and did not correlate with the dose administered .
The elimination of serum romiplostim is in part dependent on the TPO receptor on platelets .
As a result , for a given dose , patients with high platelet counts are associated with low serum concentrations and vice versa .
In another ITP clinical study , no accumulation in serum concentrations was observed ( n = 4 ) after six weekly doses of Nplate ( 3 mcg / kg ) .
The accumulation at higher doses of romiplostim is unknown .
Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation The pharmacokinetics of romiplostim is not available in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation .
Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Serum concentrations of romiplostim in pediatric patients with ITP were within the range observed in adult patients with ITP receiving the same dose range of romiplostim .
Similar to adults with ITP , romiplostim pharmacokinetics are highly variable in pediatric patients with ITP .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of romiplostim has not been evaluated .
The mutagenic potential of romiplostim has not been evaluated .
Romiplostim had no effect on the fertility of rats at doses up to 37 times the MHD based on systemic exposure .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In a 4 - week repeat - dose toxicity study in which rats were dosed subcutaneously three times per week , romiplostim caused extramedullary hematopoiesis , bone hyperostosis , and marrow fibrosis at clinically equivalent and higher doses .
In this study , these findings were not observed in animals after a 4 - week post treatment recovery period .
Studies of long - term treatment with romiplostim in rats have not been conducted ; therefore , it is not known if the fibrosis of the bone marrow is reversible in rats after long - term treatment .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Adults with ITP The safety and efficacy of Nplate in adults with ITP were assessed in two double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical studies , an open - label single - arm study , and in an open - label extension study .
Studies 1 ( NCT00102336 ) and 2 ( NCT00102323 ) In Studies 1 and 2 , patients with ITP who had completed at least one prior treatment and had a platelet count of ≤ 30 × 109 / L prior to study entry were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to 24 weeks of Nplate ( 1 mcg / kg subcutaneous [ SC ] ) or placebo .
The median time since ITP diagnosis for Studies 1 and 2 was 2 . 1 years ( range 0 . 1 to 31 . 6 ) and 8 years ( range 0 . 6 to 44 . 8 ) , respectively .
Prior ITP treatments in both study groups included corticosteroids , immunoglobulins , rituximab , cytotoxic therapies , danazol , and azathioprine .
Patients already receiving ITP medical therapies at a constant dosing schedule were allowed to continue receiving these medical treatments throughout the studies .
Rescue therapies ( i . e . , corticosteroids , IVIG , platelet transfusions , and anti - D immunoglobulin ) were permitted for bleeding , wet purpura , or if the patient was at immediate risk for hemorrhage .
Patients received single weekly SC injections of Nplate , with individual dose adjustments to maintain platelet counts ( 50 × 109 / L to 200 × 109 / L ) .
Study 1 evaluated patients who had not undergone a splenectomy .
The patients had been diagnosed with ITP for approximately 2 years and had received a median of three prior ITP treatments .
Overall , the median platelet count was 19 × 109 / L at study entry .
During the study , the median weekly Nplate dose was 2 mcg / kg ( 25 th – 75 th percentile : 1 – 3 mcg / kg ) .
Study 2 evaluated patients who had undergone a splenectomy .
The patients had been diagnosed with ITP for approximately 8 years and had received a median of six prior ITP treatments .
Overall , the median platelet count was 14 × 109 / L at study entry .
During the study , the median weekly Nplate dose was 3 mcg / kg ( 25 th – 75 th percentile : 2 - 7 mcg / kg ) .
Study 1 and 2 outcomes are shown in Table 5 .
A durable platelet response was the achievement of a weekly platelet count ≥ 50 × 109 / L for any 6 of the last 8 weeks of the 24 - week treatment period in the absence of rescue medication at any time .
A transient platelet response was the achievement of any weekly platelet counts ≥ 50 × 109 / L for any 4 weeks during the treatment period without a durable platelet response .
An overall platelet response was the achievement of either a durable or a transient platelet response .
Platelet responses were excluded for 8 weeks after receiving rescue medications .

b For multiple concomitant baseline therapies , all therapies were discontinued .
In Studies 1 and 2 , nine patients reported a serious bleeding event [ five ( 6 % ) Nplate , four ( 10 % ) placebo ] .
Bleeding events that were Grade 2 severity or higher occurred in 15 % of patients treated with Nplate and 34 % of patients treated with placebo .
Study 3 ( NCT01143038 ) Study 3 was a single - arm , open - label study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Nplate in adult patients who had an insufficient response ( platelet count ≤ 30 x 109 / L ) to first - line therapy .
The study enrolled 75 patients of whom the median age was 39 years ( range 19 to 85 ) and 59 % were female .
The median time from ITP diagnosis to study enrollment was 2 . 2 months ( range 0 . 1 to 6 . 6 ) .
Sixty percent of patients had ITP duration < 3 months and 40 % had ITP duration ≥ 3 months .
The median platelet count at screening was 20 x 109 / L .
Prior ITP treatments included corticosteroids , immunoglobulins and anti - D immunoglobulins .
Patients already receiving ITP medical therapies at a constant dosing schedule were allowed to continue receiving these medical treatments throughout the studies .
Rescue therapies ( i . e . , corticosteroids , IVIG , platelet transfusions , anti - D immunoglobulin , dapsone , danazol , and azathioprine ) were permitted .
Patients received single weekly SC injections of Nplate over a 12 - month treatment period , with individual dose adjustments to maintain platelet counts ( 50 x 109 / L to 200 x 109 / L ) .
During the study , the median weekly Nplate dose was 3 mcg / kg ( 25 th - 75 th percentile : 2 - 4 mcg / kg ) .
Of the 75 patients enrolled in Study 3 , 70 ( 93 % ) had a platelet response ≥ 50 x 109 / L during the 12 - month treatment period .
The mean number of months with platelet response during the 12 - month treatment period was 9 . 2 ( 95 % CI : 8 . 3 , 10 . 1 ) months ; the median was 11 ( 95 % CI : 10 , 11 ) months .
The Kaplan - Meier estimate of the median time to first platelet response was 2 . 1 weeks ( 95 % CI : 1 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) .
Twenty - four ( 32 % ) patients maintained every platelet count ≥ 50 x 109 / L for at least 6 months in the absence of Nplate and any medication for ITP ( concomitant or rescue ) ; the median time to onset of maintaining every platelet count ≥ 50 x 109 / L for at least 6 months was 27 weeks ( range 6 to 57 ) .
Study 4 ( NCT00116688 ) Extension Study Patients who had completed a prior Nplate study ( including Study 1 and Study 2 ) were allowed to enroll in a long - term open - label extension study .
Following Nplate discontinuation in Studies 1 and 2 , seven patients maintained platelet counts of ≥ 50 × 109 / L .
Among 291 patients who subsequently entered the extension study and received Nplate , platelet counts were increased and sustained regardless of whether they had received Nplate or placebo in the prior placebo - controlled studies .
The majority of patients reached a median platelet count of 50 × 109 / L after receiving one to three doses of Nplate , and these platelet counts were maintained throughout the remainder of the study with a median duration of Nplate treatment of 78 weeks and a maximum duration of 277 weeks .
14 . 2 Pediatric Patients with ITP The safety and efficacy of Nplate in pediatric patients 1 year and older with ITP for at least 6 months were assessed in two double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials .
Study 5 ( NCT01444417 ) In Study 5 , patients refractory or relapsed after at least one prior ITP therapy with a platelet count ≤ 30 x 109 / L were stratified by age and randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to receive Nplate ( n = 42 ) or placebo ( n = 20 ) .
The starting dose for all ages was 1 mcg / kg weekly .
Over a 24 - week treatment period , dose was titrated up to a maximum of 10 mcg / kg weekly of either Nplate or placebo in an effort to maintain a target platelet count of ≥ 50 × 109 / L to 200 × 109 / L .
The median age of the patients was 9 . 5 years ( range 3 to 17 ) and 57 % were female .
Approximately 58 % of patients had a baseline count ≤ 20 x 109 / L , which was similar between treatment arms .
The percentage of patients with at least 2 prior ITP therapies ( predominantly immunoglobulins and corticosteroids ) was 81 % in the group treated with Nplate and 70 % in the group treated with placebo .
One patient in each group had undergone splenectomy .
Study 5 results are shown in Table 6 .
The efficacy of Nplate in this trial was measured by the proportion of patients receiving Nplate achieving a durable platelet response and the proportion of patient achieving an overall platelet response .
A durable platelet response was defined as achieving at least 6 weekly platelet counts ≥ 50 × 109 / L during weeks 18 through 25 of treatment .
A transient platelet response was defined as a weekly platelet count ≥ 50 × 109 / L for 4 or more times during weeks 2 through 25 , but without durable platelet response .
An overall platelet response was defined as a durable or a transient platelet response .
Platelet responses were excluded for 4 weeks after receiving rescue medications .

Study 6 ( NCT00515203 ) In study 6 , patients diagnosed with ITP at least 6 months prior to enrollment with a platelet count ≤ 30 x 109 / L were stratified by age and randomized ( 3 : 1 ) to receive Nplate ( n = 17 ) or placebo ( n = 5 ) .
The starting dose for all ages was 1 mcg / kg weekly .
Over a 12 - week treatment period dose was titrated up to a maximum of 10 mcg / kg weekly of either Nplate or placebo in an effort to maintain a target platelet count of ≥ 50 × 109 / L to 250 × 109 / L .
The median age of the patients was 10 years ( range 1 to 17 years ) and 27 . 3 % of patients were female .
Approximately 82 % of patients had a baseline count ≤ 20 x 109 / L , which was similar between treatment arms .
The percentage of patients with at least 2 prior ITP therapies ( predominantly IVIG and corticosteroids ) was 88 % in the group treated with Nplate and 100 % in the group treated with placebo .
Six patients in the Nplate group and 2 patients in the placebo group had undergone splenectomy .
The efficacy of Nplate in this trial was measured by the proportion of patients who achieved a platelet count of ≥ 50 × 109 / L for 2 consecutive weeks and by the proportion of patients who achieved an increase in platelet count of ≥ 20 × 109 / L above baseline for 2 consecutive weeks .
Platelet responses within 4 weeks following rescue medications use were excluded .
Of the 17 patients who received romiplostim , 15 achieved a platelet count of ≥ 50 × 109 / L for 2 consecutive weeks ( 88 . 2 % , 95 % CI : 63 . 6 % , 98 . 5 % ) .
The same 15 patients also achieved an increase in platelet count of ≥ 20 × 109 / L above baseline for 2 consecutive weeks during the treatment period ( 88 . 2 % , 95 % CI : 63 . 6 % , 98 . 5 % ) .
None of the patients treated with placebo achieved either endpoint .
Study 7 ( NCT02279173 ) Long - Term Pediatric Study In study 7 , patients diagnosed with ITP at least 6 months prior to enrollment and who received at least 1 prior ITP therapy or were ineligible for other ITP therapies were enrolled to a study to evaluate efficacy for up to 3 years .
Nplate was administered weekly for up to 3 years by subcutaneous injection starting at a dose of 1 mcg / kg with weekly increments to a maximum dose of 10 mcg / kg to reach a target platelet count between 50 × 109 / L and 200 × 109 / L .
The median age of the patients was 10 years ( range 1 to 17 years ) and the median and maximum duration of treatment were 156 weeks and 163 weeks , respectively .
Among the 203 patients , the mean ( SD ) and median percentage of time with a platelet response ( platelet count ≥ 50 × 109 / L ) within the first 6 months of initiation of Nplate without rescue medication use for the past 4 weeks was 50 . 6 % ( 37 ) and 50 . 0 % , respectively .
Sixty ( 29 . 6 % ) subjects overall received rescue medications .
Rescue medications ( i . e . , corticosteroids , platelet transfusions , IVIG , azathioprine , anti - D immunoglobulin , and danazol ) were permitted .
The safety analysis set includes all subjects who received at least one dose of romiplostim in study 7 .
Bleeding events were identified using narrow search of pre - defined list of preferred terms for Haemorrhages ( SMQ ) .
Incidence rate of bleeding event is calculated as the number of subjects with bleeding events / the number of subjects on treatment .
Incidence of rescue medication is calculated as the number of subjects with rescue medication / the number of subjects on treatment .
Rescue medication start from week 1 .
Only platelet counts where rescue medication was not administered less than 28 days prior to evaluation are included .

Summary of Efficacy Endpoints for Long - term Use of NPLATE ( Study 7 ) - With Number of Patients With Bleeding Events , Number of Subjects With Rescue Medication Use , Number of Subjects on Treatment , Median Platelet Counts During the Treatment Period [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Patients with Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome Efficacy studies of Nplate could not be conducted in humans with acute radiation syndrome for ethical and feasibility reasons .
Approval for this indication was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals , Nplate ' s effect on platelet count in healthy human volunteers and on data supporting Nplate ' s effect on thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP and insufficient response to corticosteroids , immunoglobulins , or splenectomy .
Because of the uncertainty associated with extrapolating animal efficacy data to humans , the selection of a human dose for Nplate is aimed at providing platelet response to Nplate that is similar to that observed in efficacy studies conducted in animals .
The recommended dose of Nplate for patients exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation is 10 mcg / kg administered once as a subcutaneous injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
The 10 mcg / kg dosing regimen for humans is based on population modeling and simulation analyses .
For pediatric patients ( including term neonates ) , extrapolation was based on data supporting Nplate ' s effect on thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP and an insufficient response to corticosteroids , immunoglobulins , or splenectomy .
The safety of Nplate for the acute radiation syndrome setting was assessed based on the clinical experience in patients with ITP [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] and from a study with healthy volunteers .
The efficacy of Nplate was studied in a randomized , blinded , placebo - controlled study in a non - human primate model of radiation injury .
Rhesus monkeys were randomized to either a control ( n = 40 ) or treated ( n = 40 ) cohort .
Animals were exposed to total body irradiation ( TBI ) of 6 . 8 Gy from a Cobalt60 gamma ray source , representing a dose that would be lethal in 70 % of animals by 60 days of follow - up ( LD70 / 60 ) .
Animals were administered a single subcutaneous dose of blinded treatment ( control article [ sterile saline ] or Nplate [ 5 mg / kg ] ) 24 hours post - irradiation .
The primary efficacy endpoint was survival .
Animals received medical management consisting of intravenous or subcutaneous fluids , anti - ulcer medication , anti - emetic medication , analgesics , antimicrobials , and other support as required .
Nplate significantly ( one - sided p = 0 . 0002 ) increased 60 - day survival in the irradiated animals : 72 . 5 % survival ( 29 / 40 ) in the Nplate group compared to 32 . 5 % survival ( 13 / 40 ) in the control group .
In the same study , an exploratory cohort of n = 40 animals received Nplate ( 5 mg / kg ) on day 1 and pegfilgrastim ( 0 . 3 mg / kg ) on days 1 and 8 post - irradiation .
Survival in this combined treatment group was 87 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : ( 73 . 2 % , 95 . 8 % ) ) .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA - approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ) .
Advise patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation ( Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome ) that efficacy studies of Nplate for this indication could not be conducted in humans for ethical and feasibility reasons and that , therefore , approval of this use was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Inform patients of the following risks and considerations for Nplate : • Nplate therapy is administered to achieve and maintain a platelet count ≥ 50 × 109 / L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding ; Nplate is not used to normalize platelet counts .
• Following discontinuation of Nplate , thrombocytopenia and risk of bleeding may develop that is worse than that experienced prior to the Nplate therapy .
• Nplate therapy may increase the risk of reticulin fiber formation within the bone marrow .
This formation may improve upon discontinuation .
Detection of peripheral blood cell abnormalities may necessitate a bone marrow examination .
• Too much Nplate may result in excessive platelet counts and a risk for thrombotic / thromboembolic complications .
• Nplate stimulates certain bone marrow cells to make platelets and increases the risk of progression to acute myelogenous leukemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes .
• Platelet counts and CBCs must be performed weekly until a stable Nplate dose has been achieved ; thereafter , platelet counts and CBCs must be performed monthly while taking Nplate .
• Patients must be closely monitored with weekly platelet counts and CBCs for at least 2 weeks following Nplate discontinuation .
• Even with Nplate therapy , patients should continue to avoid situations or medications that may increase the risk for bleeding .
Pregnancy : • Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to inform their prescriber of a known or suspected pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Lactation : • Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Nplate [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 2 ) ] .

Revised : 01 / 2021 MEDICATION GUIDE Nplate ® ( N - plāt ) ( romiplostim ) for injection What is the most important information I should know about Nplate ?
Nplate can cause serious side effects , including : • Worsening of a precancerous blood condition to a blood cancer ( leukemia ) .
Nplate is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) , or for any condition other than immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) .
If you have MDS and receive Nplate , your MDS condition may worsen and become an acute leukemia .
If MDS worsens to become acute leukemia you may die sooner from the acute leukemia .
• Higher risk for blood clots .
○ You may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot if your platelet count becomes high during treatment with Nplate .
You may have severe complications or die from some forms of blood clots , such as clots that spread to the lungs or that cause heart attacks or strokes .
○ If you have a chronic liver disease , you may get blood clots in the veins of your liver .
This may affect your liver function .
• Injection of too much Nplate may cause a dangerous increase in your blood platelet count and serious side effects .
Your healthcare provider may change your dose or stop Nplate depending upon the change in your blood platelet count .
You must have blood platelet counts done before you start , during , and after Nplate therapy is stopped ( see “ How will I receive Nplate ? ” )
.
See “ What are the possible side effects of Nplate ? ”
for other side effects of Nplate .
What is Nplate ?
• Nplate is a prescription medicine used to treat low blood platelet counts ( thrombocytopenia ) in : • adults with immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) when certain medicines or surgery to remove your spleen have not worked well enough .
• children 1 year of age and older with ITP for at least 6 months when certain medicines or surgery to remove your spleen have not worked well enough .
• Nplate is a prescription medicine also used to treat people including newborns who have been exposed to high levels of radiation ( acute radiation syndrome ) .
The effectiveness of Nplate for this use was only studied in animals , because it could not be studied in people .
• Nplate is not for use in people with a precancerous condition called myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , or low platelet count caused by any condition other than ITP .
• Nplate is only used if your low platelet count and medical condition increase your risk of bleeding .
• Nplate is used to try to keep your platelet count about 50 , 000 per microliter in order to lower the risk for bleeding .
Nplate is not used to make your platelet count normal .
• It is not known if Nplate is safe and effective in children under the age of 1 .
Before receiving Nplate , first speak to your healthcare provider and understand the benefits and risks of Nplate .
Be sure to tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions , including if you : • have had surgery to remove your spleen ( splenectomy ) • have a bone marrow problem , including a blood cancer or MDS • have or had a blood clot • have chronic liver disease • have bleeding problems • are pregnant or plan to become pregnant .
Nplate may harm your unborn baby .
Tell your healthcare provider if you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant during treatment with Nplate .
