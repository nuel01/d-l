5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension : Abrupt discontinuation of GENOSYL may lead to worsening oxygenation and increasing pulmonary artery pressure ( 5 . 1 ) .
Methemoglobinemia : Methemoglobin increases with the dose of nitric oxide ; following discontinuation or reduction of nitric oxide , methemoglobin levels return to baseline over a period of hours ( 5 . 2 ) .
Elevated NO2 Levels : Monitor NO2 levels ( 5 . 3 ) .
Heart Failure : In patients with pre - existing left ventricular dysfunction , GENOSYL may increase pulmonary capillary wedge pressure leading to pulmonary edema ( 5 . 4 ) .
5 . 1 Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome following Abrupt Discontinuation Wean from GENOSYL [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Abrupt discontinuation of GENOSYL may lead to worsening oxygenation and increasing pulmonary artery pressure , i . e . , Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome .
Signs and symptoms of Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome include hypoxemia , systemic hypotension , bradycardia , and decreased cardiac output .
If Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension occurs , reinstate GENOSYL therapy immediately .
5 . 2 Hypoxemia from Methemoglobinemia Nitric oxide combines with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin , which does not transport oxygen .
Methemoglobin levels increase with the dose of GENOSYL ; it can take 8 hours or more before steady - state methemoglobin levels are attained .
Monitor methemoglobin and adjust the dose of GENOSYL to optimize oxygenation .
If methemoglobin levels do not resolve with decrease in dose or discontinuation of GENOSYL , additional therapy may be warranted to treat methemoglobinemia [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
5 . 3 Airway Injury from Nitrogen Dioxide Nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) forms in gas mixtures containing NO and O2 .
Nitrogen dioxide may cause airway inflammation and damage to lung tissues .
If there is an unexpected change in NO2 concentration , or if the NO2 concentration reaches 0 . 5 ppm when measured in the breathing circuit , then the delivery system should be assessed in accordance with the GENOSYL Delivery System Operator ' s Manual troubleshooting section , and the NO2 analyzer should be recalibrated .
The dose of GENOSYL and / or FiO2 should be adjusted as appropriate .
5 . 4 Worsening Heart Failure Patients with left ventricular dysfunction treated with GENOSYL may experience pulmonary edema , increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , worsening of left ventricular dysfunction , systemic hypotension , bradycardia and cardiac arrest .
Discontinue GENOSYL while providing symptomatic care .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label ; Hypoxemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] Worsening Heart Failure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] The most common adverse reaction is hypotension ( 6 ) .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The adverse reaction information from the clinical studies does , however , provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates .
Controlled studies have included 325 patients on nitric oxide doses of 5 to 80 ppm and 251 patients on placebo .
Total mortality in the pooled trials was 11 % on placebo and 9 % on nitric oxide gas for inhalation , a result adequate to exclude nitric oxide mortality being more than 40 % worse than placebo .
In both the NINOS and CINRGI studies , the duration of hospitalization was similar in nitric oxide gas for inhalation and placebo - treated groups .
From all controlled studies , at least 6 months of follow - up is available for 278 patients who received nitric oxide gas and 212 patients who received placebo .
Among these patients , there was no evidence of an adverse effect of treatment on the need for re - hospitalization , special medical services , pulmonary disease , and neurological sequelae .
In the NINOS study , treatment groups were similar with respect to the incidence and severity of intracranial hemorrhage , Grade IV hemorrhage , periventricular leukomalacia , cerebral infarction , seizures requiring anticonvulsant therapy , pulmonary hemorrhage , or gastrointestinal hemorrhage .
In CINRGI , the only adverse reaction ( > 2 % higher incidence on nitric oxide gas for inhalation than on placebo ) was hypotension ( 14 % vs . 11 % ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Post marketing reports of accidental exposure to nitric oxide for inhalation in hospital staff has been associated with chest discomfort , dizziness , dry throat , dyspnea , and headache .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nitric oxide donor compounds may increase the risk of developing methemoglobinemia ( 7 ) .
7 . 1 Nitric Oxide Donor Agents Nitric oxide donor agents such as prilocaine , sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerine may increase the risk of developing methemoglobinemia .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of nitric oxide for inhalation has been demonstrated in term and near - term neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with evidence of pulmonary hypertension [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Additional studies conducted in premature neonates for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia have not demonstrated substantial evidence of efficacy [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
No information about its effectiveness in other age populations is available .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Nitric oxide is not indicated for use in the adult population .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with nitric oxide gas is manifest by elevations in methemoglobin and pulmonary toxicities associated with inspired NO2 .
Elevated NO2 may cause acute lung injury .
Elevations in methemoglobin reduce the oxygen delivery capacity of the circulation .
In clinical studies , NO2 levels > 3 ppm or methemoglobin levels > 7 % were treated by reducing the dose of , or discontinuing , nitric oxide gas .
Methemoglobinemia that does not resolve after reduction or discontinuation of therapy can be treated with intravenous vitamin C , intravenous methylene blue , or blood transfusion , based upon the clinical situation .
11 DESCRIPTION GENOSYL ( nitric oxide ) is administered by inhalation .
Nitric oxide is a pulmonary vasodilator .
Nitric oxide is generated from liquid dinitrogen tetroxide ( N2O4 ) by the cassette in the GENOSYL Delivery System .
Upon initiation of GENOSYL Delivery System , the liquid N2O4 is heated and the equilibrium shifts to nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) gas .
The NO2 is then converted into nitric oxide ( NO ) using the antioxidant cartridges , and nitric oxide is delivered to the patient by means of a ventilator or a nasal cannula .
The amount of nitric oxide administered to the patient is set by controlling the temperature of the N2O4 liquid module , which controls the pressure inside the liquid module , which in turn controls the mass of NO2 that is sent to the primary cartridges , and hence the mass of nitric oxide .
The mass flow of nitric oxide , together with the air from the pump , control the nitric oxide concentration .
A nitric oxide sensor monitors the nitric oxide in the patient line .
GENOSYL Delivery System is designed to deliver a controlled level of nitric oxide blended with breathing air or oxygen - enriched breathing air .
The GENOSYL Delivery System controls the flow of nitric oxide mixed with air delivered to the patient .
The structural formula of nitric oxide ( NO ) is shown below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Nitric oxide relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase , activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine 3 ' , 5 ' - monophosphate , which then leads to vasodilation .
When inhaled , nitric oxide selectively dilates the pulmonary vasculature , and because of efficient scavenging by hemoglobin , has minimal effect on the systemic vasculature .
GENOSYL appears to increase the partial pressure of arterial oxygen ( PaO2 ) by dilating pulmonary vessels in better ventilated areas of the lung , redistributing pulmonary blood flow away from lung regions with low ventilation / perfusion ( V / Q ) ratios toward regions with normal ratios .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on Pulmonary Vascular Tone in PPHN Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn ( PPHN ) occurs as a primary developmental defect or as a condition secondary to other diseases such as meconium aspiration syndrome ( MAS ) , pneumonia , sepsis , hyaline membrane disease , congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( CDH ) , and pulmonary hypoplasia .
In these states , pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) is high , which results in hypoxemia secondary to right - to - left shunting of blood through the patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale .
In neonates with PPHN , nitric oxide gas for inhalation improves oxygenation ( as indicated by significant increases in PaO2 ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of nitric oxide has been studied in adults .
Absorption and Distribution Nitric oxide is absorbed systemically after inhalation .
Most of it traverses the pulmonary capillary bed where it combines with hemoglobin that is 60 % to 100 % oxygen - saturated .
At this level of oxygen saturation , nitric oxide combines predominantly with oxyhemoglobin to produce methemoglobin and nitrate .
At low oxygen saturation , nitric oxide can combine with deoxyhemoglobin to transiently form nitrosylhemoglobin , which is converted to nitrogen oxides and methemoglobin upon exposure to oxygen .
Within the pulmonary system , nitric oxide can combine with oxygen and water to produce nitrogen dioxide and nitrite , respectively , which interact with oxyhemoglobin to produce methemoglobin and nitrate .
Thus , the end products of nitric oxide that enter the systemic circulation are predominantly methemoglobin and nitrate .
Metabolism Methemoglobin disposition has been investigated as a function of time and nitric oxide exposure concentration in neonates with respiratory failure .
The methemoglobin ( MetHb ) concentration - time profiles during the first 12 hours of exposure to 0 , 5 , 20 , and 80 ppm nitric oxide are shown in Figure 1 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Methemoglobin concentrations increased during the first 8 hours of nitric oxide exposure .
The mean methemoglobin level remained below 1 % in the placebo group and in the 5 ppm and 20 ppm nitric oxide gas groups , but reached approximately 5 % in the 80 ppm nitric oxide gas group .
Methemoglobin levels > 7 % were attained only in patients receiving 80 ppm , where they comprised 35 % of the group .
The average time to reach peak methemoglobin was 10 ± 9 ( SD ) hours ( median , 8 hours ) in these 13 patients , but one patient did not exceed 7 % until 40 hours .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Elimination Nitrate has been identified as the predominant nitric oxide metabolite excreted in the urine , accounting for > 70 % of the nitric oxide dose inhaled .
Nitrate is cleared from the plasma by the kidney at rates approaching the rate of glomerular filtration .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was apparent , at inhalation exposures up to the recommended dose ( 20 ppm ) , in rats for 20 hr / day for up to two years .
Higher exposures have not been investigated .
Nitric oxide gas has demonstrated genotoxicity in Salmonella ( Ames Test ) , human lymphocytes , and after in vivo exposure in rats .
There are no animal or human studies to evaluate nitric oxide for effects on fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Treatment of Hypoxic Respiratory Failure ( HRF ) The efficacy of nitric oxide gas was investigated in term and near - term newborns with hypoxic respiratory failure ( HRF ) resulting from a variety of etiologies .
Inhalation of nitric oxide gas reduces the oxygenation index ( OI = mean airway pressure in cm H2O × fraction of inspired oxygen concentration [ FiO2 ] × 100 divided by systemic arterial concentration in mm Hg [ PaO2 ] ) and increases PaO2 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
NINOS Study The Neonatal Inhaled Nitric Oxide Study ( NINOS ) was a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , multicenter trial in 235 neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure .
The objective of the study was to determine whether inhaled nitric oxide would reduce the occurrence of death and / or initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) in a prospectively defined cohort of term or near - term neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure unresponsive to conventional therapy .
Hypoxic respiratory failure was caused by meconium aspiration syndrome ( MAS ; 49 % ) , pneumonia / sepsis ( 21 % ) , idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension of the newborn ( PPHN ; 17 % ) , or respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ; 11 % ) .
Infants 14 days of age ( mean , 1 . 7 days ) with a mean PaO2 of 46 mm Hg and a mean oxygenation index ( OI ) of 43 cm H2O / mm Hg were initially randomized to receive 100 % O2 with ( n = 114 ) or without ( n = 121 ) 20 ppm nitric oxide for up to 14 days .
Response to study drug was defined as a change from baseline in PaO2 30 minutes after starting treatment ( full response = > 20 mm Hg , partial = 10 - 20 mm Hg , no response = < 10 mm Hg ) .
Neonates with a less than full response were evaluated for a response to 80 ppm nitric oxide or control gas .
The primary results of this study are presented in Table 1 .
Table 1 : Summary of Clinical Results from Hypoxic Respiratory Failure Study Control ( n = 121 ) Nitric Oxide gas ( n = 114 ) P value Death or ECMO [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 77 ( 64 % ) 52 ( 46 % ) 0 . 006 Death 20 ( 17 % ) 16 ( 14 % ) 0 . 60 ECMO 66 ( 55 % ) 44 ( 39 % ) 0 . 014 [ 1 ] Death or need for ECMO was the primary end point of this study [ 2 ] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Although the incidence of death by 120 days of age was similar in both groups ( NO , 14 % ; control 17 % ) , significantly fewer infants in the nitric oxide group required ECMO compared with controls ( 39 % vs . 55 % , p = 0 . 014 ) .
The combined incidence of death and / or initiation of ECMO showed a significant advantage for the nitric oxide treated group ( 46 % vs . 64 % , p = 0 . 006 ) .
The nitric oxide group also had significantly greater increases in PaO2 and greater decreases in the OI and the alveolar - arterial oxygen gradient than the control group ( p < 0 . 001 for all parameters ) .
Significantly more patients had at least a partial response to the initial administration of study drug in the nitric oxide group ( 66 % ) than the control group ( 26 % , p < 0 . 001 ) .
Of the 125 infants who did not respond to 20 ppm nitric oxide control , similar percentages of NO - treated ( 18 % ) and control ( 20 % ) patients had at least a partial response to 80 ppm nitric oxide gas for inhalation or control drug , suggesting a lack of additional benefit for the higher dose of nitric oxide .
No infant had study drug discontinued for toxicity .
Inhaled nitric oxide gas had no detectable effect on mortality .
The adverse events collected in the NINOS trial occurred at similar incidence rates in both treatment groups [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Follow - up exams were performed at 18 - 24 months for the infants enrolled in this trial .
In the infants with available follow - up , the two treatment groups were similar with respect to their mental , motor , audiologic , or neurologic evaluations .
CINRGI Study This study was a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , multi - center trial of 186 term and near - term neonates with pulmonary hypertension and hypoxic respiratory failure .
The primary objective of the study was to determine whether nitric oxide gas would reduce the receipt of ECMO in these patients .
Hypoxic respiratory failure was caused by MAS ( 35 % ) , idiopathic PPHN ( 30 % ) , pneumonia / sepsis ( 24 % ) , or RDS ( 8 % ) .
Patients with a mean PaO2 of 54 mm Hg and a mean OI of 44 cm H2O / mm Hg were randomly assigned to receive either 20 ppm nitric oxide gas ( n = 97 ) or nitrogen gas ( placebo ; n = 89 ) in addition to their ventilatory support .
Patients who exhibited a PaO2 > 60 mm Hg and a pH < 7 . 55 were weaned to 5 ppm nitric oxide gas or placebo .
The primary results from the CINRGI study are presented in Table 2 .
Table 2 : Summary of Clinical Results from Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn Study Placebo Nitric oxide gas P value ECMO [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 51 / 89 ( 57 % ) 30 / 97 ( 31 % ) < 0 . 001 Death 5 / 89 ( 6 % ) 3 / 97 ( 3 % ) 0 . 48 [ 1 ] ECMO was the primary end point of this study [ 2 ] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Significantly fewer neonates in the nitric oxide gas group required ECMO compared to the control group ( 31 % vs . 57 % , p < 0 . 001 ) .
While the number of deaths were similar in both groups ( Nitric oxide gas , 3 % ; placebo , 6 % ) , the combined incidence of death and / or receipt of ECMO was decreased in the nitric oxide gas group ( 33 % vs . 58 % , p < 0 . 001 ) .
In addition , the nitric oxide gas group had significantly improved oxygenation as measured by PaO2 , OI , and alveolar - arterial gradient ( p < 0 . 001 for all parameters ) .
Of the 97 patients treated with nitric oxide gas , 2 ( 2 % ) were withdrawn from study drug due to methemoglobin levels > 4 % .
The frequency and number of adverse events reported were similar in the two study groups [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In clinical trials , reduction in the need for ECMO has not been demonstrated with the use of inhaled nitric oxide in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( CDH ) .
14 . 2 Ineffective in Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) In a randomized , double - blind , parallel , multicenter study , 385 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) associated with pneumonia ( 46 % ) , surgery ( 33 % ) , multiple trauma ( 26 % ) , aspiration ( 23 % ) , pulmonary contusion ( 18 % ) , and other causes , with PaO2 / FiO2 < 250 mm Hg despite optimal oxygenation and ventilation , received placebo ( n = 193 ) or nitric oxide gas ( n = 192 ) , 5 ppm , for 4 hours to 28 days or until weaned because of improvements in oxygenation .
Despite acute improvements in oxygenation , there was no effect of nitric oxide gas on the primary endpoint of days alive and off ventilator support .
These results were consistent with outcome data from a smaller dose ranging study of nitric oxide ( 1 . 25 to 80 ppm ) .
GENOSYL ( nitric oxide ) for inhalation is not indicated for use in ARDS .
14 . 3 Ineffective in Prevention of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ( BPD ) The safety and efficacy of nitric oxide gas for the prevention of chronic lung disease [ bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) ] in neonates ≤ 34 weeks gestational age requiring respiratory support has been studied in four large previously conducted multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials in a total of 2 , 600 preterm infants .
Of these , 1 , 290 received placebo , and 1 , 310 received inhaled nitric oxide at doses ranging from 5 - 20 ppm , for treatment periods of 7 - 24 days duration .
The primary endpoint for these studies was alive and without BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age ( PMA ) .
The need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA served as a surrogate endpoint for the presence of BPD .
Overall , efficacy for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants was not established .
There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups with regard to overall deaths , methemoglobin levels , or adverse events commonly observed in premature infants , including intraventricular hemorrhage , patent ductus arteriosus , pulmonary hemorrhage , and retinopathy of prematurity .
The use of GENOSYL ( nitric oxide ) for prevention of BPD in preterm neonates ≤ 34 weeks gestational age is not recommended .
