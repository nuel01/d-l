11 DESCRIPTION Veltassa is a powder for suspension in water for oral administration .
The active ingredient is patiromer sorbitex calcium which consists of the active moiety , patiromer , a non - absorbed potassium - binding polymer , and a calcium - sorbitol counterion .
Each gram of patiromer is equivalent to a nominal amount of 2 grams of patiromer sorbitex calcium .
The chemical name for patiromer sorbitex calcium is cross - linked polymer of calcium 2 - fluoroprop - 2 - enoate with diethenylbenzene and octa - 1 , 7 - diene , combination with D - glucitol .
Patiromer sorbitex calcium is an amorphous , free - flowing powder that is composed of individual spherical beads .
Patiromer sorbitex calcium is insoluble in solvents such as water , 0 . 1 M HCl , n - heptane and methanol .
The chemical structure of patiromer sorbitex calcium is presented in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 : Chemical Structure of Patiromer Sorbitex Calcium [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each packet of Veltassa contains 8 . 4 grams , 16 . 8 grams or 25 . 2 grams of patiromer , the active moiety .
The inactive ingredient is xanthan gum .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Veltassa is a non - absorbed , cation exchange polymer that contains a calcium - sorbitol counterion .
Veltassa increases fecal potassium excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract .
Binding of potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the gastrointestinal lumen , resulting in a reduction of serum potassium levels .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a Phase 1 study in healthy adult subjects ( 6 to 8 subjects per group ) , Veltassa ( 0 grams to 50 . 4 grams per day ) administered three times a day for 8 days caused a dose - dependent increase in fecal potassium excretion .
A corresponding dose - dependent decrease in urinary potassium excretion with no change in serum potassium were also observed .
Compared to placebo , Veltassa doses of 25 . 2 and 50 . 4 grams per day significantly decreased mean daily urinary potassium excretion .
In a Phase 1 , open - label , multiple - dose crossover study in 12 healthy subjects , 25 . 2 grams of patiromer per day was administered orally as a once daily , twice daily or thrice daily regimen for 6 days in a randomly assigned order .
A significant increase in mean daily fecal potassium excretion and concomitant decrease in mean daily urinary potassium excretion were observed during the treatment periods for all three dosing regimens .
The mean increase in fecal potassium excretion ranged from 1283 to 1550 mg / day , and the mean decrease in urinary potassium excretion ranged from 1438 to 1534 mg / day across the three dosing regimens .
No significant differences were observed among the dosing regimens with respect to mean daily fecal potassium and urinary potassium excretion .
This was true for the overall comparison among the three dosing regimens , as well as for the pairwise comparisons .
In an open - label , uncontrolled study , 25 patients with hyperkalemia ( mean baseline serum potassium of 5 . 9 mEq / L ) and chronic kidney disease were given a controlled potassium diet for 3 days , followed by 16 . 8 grams patiromer daily ( as divided doses ) for 2 days while the controlled diet was continued .
A statistically significant reduction in serum potassium ( - 0 . 2 mEq / L ) was observed at 7 hours after the first dose .
Serum potassium levels continued to decline during the 48 - hour treatment period ( - 0 . 8 mEq / L at 48 hours after the first dose ) .
Potassium levels remained stable for 24 hours after the last dose , then rose during the 4 - day observation period following discontinuation of Veltassa .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In radiolabeled ADME studies in rats and dogs , patiromer was not systemically absorbed and was excreted in the feces .
Quantitative whole - body autoradiography analysis in rats demonstrated that radioactivity was limited to the gastrointestinal tract , with no detectable level of radioactivity in any other tissues or organs .
Effect of Food Veltassa can be taken with or without food .
In an open - label study , 114 patients with hyperkalemia were randomized to Veltassa once daily with food or without food .
Serum potassium at the end of treatment , the change from baseline in serum potassium , and the mean dose of Veltassa were similar between groups .
Drug Interactions Twenty - eight ( 28 ) drugs were tested to determine the potential for interaction with Veltassa .
Fourteen ( 14 ) drugs tested did not show an in vitro interaction with Veltassa ( acetylsalicylic acid , allopurinol , amoxicillin , apixaban , atorvastatin , cephalexin , digoxin , glipizide , lisinopril , phenytoin , riboflavin , rivaroxaban , spironolactone and valsartan ) .
Twelve ( 12 ) of the 14 drugs that showed an in vitro interaction were subsequently tested in vivo .
These studies in healthy volunteers showed that Veltassa did not alter the systemic exposure of amlodipine , cinacalcet , clopidogrel , furosemide , lithium , metoprolol , trimethoprim , verapamil or warfarin when coadministered with Veltassa .
Veltassa decreased the systemic exposure of coadministered ciprofloxacin , levothyroxine and metformin .
However , there was no interaction when Veltassa and these drugs were taken 3 hours apart ( Figure 2 ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .

Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed .
Patiromer did not impair the fertility in male or female rats at doses up to 10 - fold the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Two - Part , Randomized Withdrawal Study The efficacy of Veltassa was demonstrated in a two - part , single - blind randomized withdrawal study that evaluated Veltassa in hyperkalemic patients with CKD on stable doses of at least one renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system inhibitor ( i . e . , angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor , angiotensin II receptor blocker , or aldosterone antagonist ) .
In Part A , 243 patients were treated with Veltassa for 4 weeks .
Patients with a baseline serum potassium of 5 . 1 mEq / L to < 5 . 5 mEq / L received a starting Veltassa dose of 8 . 4 grams patiromer per day ( as a divided dose ) and patients with a baseline serum potassium of 5 . 5 mEq / L to < 6 . 5 mEq / L received a starting Veltassa dose of 16 . 8 grams patiromer per day ( as a divided dose ) .
The dose of Veltassa was titrated , as needed , based on the serum potassium level , assessed starting on Day 3 and then at weekly visits ( Weeks 1 , 2 and 3 ) to the end of the 4 - week treatment period , with the aim of maintaining serum potassium in the target range ( 3 . 8 mEq / L to < 5 . 1 mEq / L ) .
The mean age of patients was 64 years , 58 % of patients were men , and 98 % were Caucasian .
Approximately 97 % of patients had hypertension , 57 % had type 2 diabetes , and 42 % had heart failure .
Results for the Part A primary endpoint , the change in serum potassium from Baseline to Week 4 , are summarized in Table 2 .
Mean serum potassium over time for the intent - to - treat population is displayed in Figure 3 .
For the Part A secondary endpoint , 76 % ( 95 % CI : 70 % , 81 % ) of patients had a serum potassium in the target range of 3 . 8 mEq / L to < 5 . 1 mEq / L at Week 4 .
The mean daily doses of Veltassa were 13 grams and 21 grams in patients with serum potassium of 5 . 1 to < 5 . 5 mEq / L and 5 . 5 to < 6 . 5 mEq / L , respectively .

In patients randomized to Veltassa , the mean daily dose was 21 grams at the start of Part B and during Part B .
The Part B primary endpoint was the change in serum potassium from Part B baseline to the earliest visit at which the patient ' s serum potassium was first outside of the range of 3 . 8 to < 5 . 5 mEq / L , or to Part B Week 4 if the patient ' s serum potassium remained in the range .
In Part B , serum potassium rose by 0 . 72 mEq / L in patients who were switched to placebo , versus no change in patients who remained on Veltassa .
Results are summarized in Table 3 .
