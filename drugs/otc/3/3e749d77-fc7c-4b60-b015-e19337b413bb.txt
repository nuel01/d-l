2 . 1 Important Dosing Information Evaluation of Iron Stores and Nutritional Factors Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment .
Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg / L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20 % .
The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy .
Monitoring of Response to Therapy Correct or exclude other causes of anemia ( e . g . , vitamin deficiency , metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions , bleeding , etc . ) before initiating PROCRIT .
Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment , monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion .
Selection of Formulation In pregnant women , lactating women , neonates , and infants use only single - dose vials ( the benzyl alcohol - free formulation ) [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 2 , and 8 . 4 ) ] .
2 . 2 Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease In controlled trials , patients experienced greater risks for death , serious adverse cardiovascular reactions , and stroke when administered erythropoiesis - stimulating agents ( ESAs ) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g / dL .
No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level , ESA dose , or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks .
Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of PROCRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse reactions [ see Boxed Warning and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
For all patients with CKD : When initiating or adjusting therapy , monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable , then monitor at least monthly .
When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise , rate of decline , ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability .
A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change .
• Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks .
Decreases in dose can occur more frequently .
Avoid frequent dose adjustments .
• If the hemoglobin rises rapidly ( e . g . , more than 1 g / dL in any 2 - week period ) , reduce the dose of PROCRIT by 25 % or more as needed to reduce rapid responses .
• For patients who do not respond adequately , if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g / dL after 4 weeks of therapy , increase the dose by 25 % .
• For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12 - week escalation period , increasing the PROCRIT dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks .
Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions .
Evaluate other causes of anemia .
Discontinue PROCRIT if responsiveness does not improve .
For adult patients with CKD on dialysis : • Initiate PROCRIT treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g / dL .
• If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g / dL , reduce or interrupt the dose of PROCRIT .
• The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units / kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously .
The intravenous route is recommended for patients on hemodialysis .
For adult patients with CKD not on dialysis : • Consider initiating PROCRIT treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g / dL and the following considerations apply : • The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and , • Reducing the risk of alloimmunization and / or other RBC transfusion - related risks is a goal • If the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g / dL , reduce or interrupt the dose of PROCRIT , and use the lowest dose of PROCRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions .
• The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units / kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously .
For pediatric patients with CKD : • Initiate PROCRIT treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g / dL .
• If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 12 g / dL , reduce or interrupt the dose of PROCRIT .
• The recommended starting dose for pediatric patients ( ages 1 month or older ) is 50 Units / kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously .
When treating patients who have chronic kidney disease and cancer , physicians should refer to Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 and 5 . 2 ) .
2 . 3 Zidovudine - treated Patients with HIV - infection Starting Dose The recommended starting dose in adults is 100 Units / kg as an intravenous or subcutaneous injection 3 times per week .
Dose Adjustment • If hemoglobin does not increase after 8 weeks of therapy , increase PROCRIT dose by approximately 50 to 100 Units / kg at 4 - to 8 - week intervals until hemoglobin reaches a level needed to avoid RBC transfusions or 300 Units / kg .
• Withhold PROCRIT if hemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dL .
Resume therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose when hemoglobin declines to less than 11 g / dL .
Discontinue PROCRIT if an increase in hemoglobin is not achieved at a dose of 300 Units / kg for 8 weeks .
2 . 4 Patients on Cancer Chemotherapy Initiate PROCRIT in patients on cancer chemotherapy only if the hemoglobin is less than 10 g / dL , and if there is a minimum of two additional months of planned chemotherapy .
Use the lowest dose of PROCRIT necessary to avoid RBC transfusions .
Recommended Starting Dose Adults : • 150 Units / kg subcutaneously 3 times per week until completion of a chemotherapy course or • 40 , 000 Units subcutaneously weekly until completion of a chemotherapy course .
Pediatric Patients ( 5 to 18 years ) : • 600 Units / kg intravenously weekly until completion of a chemotherapy course .
Dose Reduction Reduce dose by 25 % if : • Hemoglobin increases greater than 1 g / dL in any 2 - week period or • Hemoglobin reaches a level needed to avoid RBC transfusion .
Withhold dose if hemoglobin exceeds a level needed to avoid RBC transfusion .
Reinitiate at a dose 25 % below the previous dose when hemoglobin approaches a level where RBC transfusions may be required .
Dose Increase After the initial 4 weeks of PROCRIT therapy , if hemoglobin increases by less than 1 g / dL and remains below 10 g / dL , increase dose to : • 300 Units / kg three times per week in adults or • 60 , 000 Units weekly in adults • 900 Units / kg ( maximum 60 , 000 Units ) weekly in pediatric patients After 8 weeks of therapy , if there is no response as measured by hemoglobin levels or if RBC transfusions are still required , discontinue PROCRIT .
2 . 5 Surgery Patients The recommended PROCRIT regimens are : • 300 Units / kg per day subcutaneously for 15 days total : administered daily for 10 days before surgery , on the day of surgery , and for 4 days after surgery .
• 600 Units / kg subcutaneously in 4 doses administered 21 , 14 , and 7 days before surgery and on the day of surgery .

Use caution in patients with coexistent cardiovascular disease and stroke ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Increased Mortality and / or Increased Risk of Tumor Progression or Recurrence in Patients With Cancer ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Hypertension : Control hypertension prior to initiating and during treatment with PROCRIT ( 5 . 3 ) .
• Seizures : PROCRIT increases the risk for seizures in patients with CKD ( 5 . 4 ) .
Increase monitoring of these patients for changes in seizure frequency or premonitory symptoms ( 5 . 4 ) .
• PRCA : If severe anemia and low reticulocyte count develop during PROCRIT treatment , withhold PROCRIT and evaluate for PRCA ( 5 . 6 ) .
• Serious Allergic Reactions : Discontinue PROCRIT and manage reactions ( 5 . 7 ) .
• Severe Cutaneous Reactions : Discontinue PROCRIT ( 5 . 8 ) .
5 . 1 Increased Mortality , Myocardial Infarction , Stroke , and Thromboembolism • In controlled clinical trials of patients with CKD comparing higher hemoglobin targets ( 13 – 14 g / dL ) to lower targets ( 9 – 11 . 3 g / dL ) , PROCRIT and other ESAs increased the risk of death , myocardial infarction , stroke , congestive heart failure , thrombosis of hemodialysis vascular access , and other thromboembolic events in the higher target groups .
• Using ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g / dL increases the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular reactions and has not been shown to provide additional benefit [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Use caution in patients with coexistent cardiovascular disease and stroke [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Patients with CKD and an insufficient hemoglobin response to ESA therapy may be at even greater risk for cardiovascular reactions and mortality than other patients .
A rate of hemoglobin rise of greater than 1 g / dL over 2 weeks may contribute to these risks .
• In controlled clinical trials of patients with cancer , PROCRIT and other ESAs increased the risks for death and serious adverse cardiovascular reactions .
These adverse reactions included myocardial infarction and stroke .
• In controlled clinical trials , ESAs increased the risk of death in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) and the risk of deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) in patients undergoing orthopedic procedures .
The design and overall results of the 3 large trials comparing higher and lower hemoglobin targets are shown in Table 1 .
Table 1 : Randomized Controlled Trials Showing Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With CKD Normal Hematocrit Study ( NHS ) ( N = 1265 ) CHOIR ( N = 1432 ) TREAT ( N = 4038 ) Time Period of Trial 1993 to 1996 2003 to 2006 2004 to 2009 Population CKD patients on hemodialysis with coexisting CHF or CAD , hematocrit 30 ± 3 % on epoetin alfa CKD patients not on dialysis with hemoglobin < 11 g / dL not previously administered epoetin alfa CKD patients not on dialysis with type II diabetes , hemoglobin ≤ 11 g / dL Hemoglobin Target ; Higher vs .

In this study , patients were randomized to epoetin alfa treatment targeted to a maintenance hemoglobin of either 14 ± 1 g / dL or 10 ± 1 g / dL .
The trial was terminated early with adverse safety findings of higher mortality in the high hematocrit target group .
Higher mortality ( 35 % vs . 29 % ) was observed for the patients randomized to a target hemoglobin of 14 g / dL than for the patients randomized to a target hemoglobin of 10 g / dL .
For all - cause mortality , the HR = 1 . 27 ; 95 % CI ( 1 . 04 , 1 . 54 ) ; p = 0 . 018 .
The incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction , vascular access thrombosis , and other thrombotic events was also higher in the group randomized to a target hemoglobin of 14 g / dL .
CHOIR : A randomized , prospective trial , 1432 patients with anemia due to CKD who were not undergoing dialysis and who had not previously received epoetin alfa therapy were randomized to epoetin alfa treatment targeting a maintenance hemoglobin concentration of either 13 . 5 g / dL or 11 . 3 g / dL .
The trial was terminated early with adverse safety findings .
A major cardiovascular event ( death , myocardial infarction , stroke , or hospitalization for congestive heart failure ) occurred in 125 of the 715 patients ( 18 % ) in the higher hemoglobin group compared to 97 of the 717 patients ( 14 % ) in the lower hemoglobin group [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 1 . 34 , 95 % CI : 1 . 03 , 1 . 74 ; p = 0 . 03 ] .
TREAT : A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , prospective trial of 4038 patients with : CKD not on dialysis ( eGFR of 20 – 60 mL / min ) , anemia ( hemoglobin levels ≤ 11 g / dL ) , and type 2 diabetes mellitus , patients were randomized to receive either darbepoetin alfa treatment or a matching placebo .
Placebo group patients also received darbepoetin alfa when their hemoglobin levels were below 9 g / dL .
The trial objectives were to demonstrate the benefit of darbepoetin alfa treatment of the anemia to a target hemoglobin level of 13 g / dL , when compared to a " placebo " group , by reducing the occurrence of either of two primary endpoints : ( 1 ) a composite cardiovascular endpoint of all - cause mortality or a specified cardiovascular event ( myocardial ischemia , CHF , MI , and CVA ) or ( 2 ) a composite renal endpoint of all - cause mortality or progression to end stage renal disease .
The overall risks for each of the two primary endpoints ( the cardiovascular composite and the renal composite ) were not reduced with darbepoetin alfa treatment ( see Table 1 ) , but the risk of stroke was increased nearly two - fold in the darbepoetin alfa - treated group versus the placebo group : annualized stroke rate 2 . 1 % vs . 1 . 1 % , respectively , HR 1 . 92 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 38 , 2 . 68 ; p < 0 . 001 .
The relative risk of stroke was particularly high in patients with a prior stroke : annualized stroke rate 5 . 2 % in the darbepoetin alfa - treated group and 1 . 9 % in the placebo group , HR 3 . 07 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 44 , 6 . 54 .
Also , among darbepoetin alfa - treated subjects with a past history of cancer , there were more deaths due to all causes and more deaths adjudicated as due to cancer , in comparison with the control group .
Patients with Cancer An increased incidence of thromboembolic reactions , some serious and life - threatening , occurred in patients with cancer treated with ESAs .
In a randomized , placebo - controlled study ( Study 2 in Table 2 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] ) of 939 women with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , patients received either weekly epoetin alfa or placebo for up to a year .
This study was designed to show that survival was superior when epoetin alfa was administered to prevent anemia ( maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g / dL or hematocrit between 36 % and 42 % ) .
This study was terminated prematurely when interim results demonstrated a higher mortality at 4 months ( 8 . 7 % vs . 3 . 4 % ) and a higher rate of fatal thrombotic reactions ( 1 . 1 % vs . 0 . 2 % ) in the first 4 months of the study among patients treated with epoetin alfa .
Based on Kaplan - Meier estimates , at the time of study termination , the 12 - month survival was lower in the epoetin alfa group than in the placebo group ( 70 % vs . 76 % ; HR 1 . 37 , 95 % CI : 1 . 07 , 1 . 75 ; p = 0 . 012 ) .
Patients Having Surgery An increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) in patients receiving epoetin alfa undergoing surgical orthopedic procedures was demonstrated [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In a randomized , controlled study , 680 adult patients , not receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and undergoing spinal surgery , were randomized to 4 doses of 600 Units / kg epoetin alfa ( 7 , 14 , and 21 days before surgery , and the day of surgery ) and standard of care ( SOC ) treatment ( n = 340 ) or to SOC treatment alone ( n = 340 ) .
A higher incidence of DVTs , determined by either color flow duplex imaging or by clinical symptoms , was observed in the epoetin alfa group ( 16 [ 4 . 7 % ] patients ) compared with the SOC group ( 7 [ 2 . 1 % ] patients ) .
In addition to the 23 patients with DVTs included in the primary analysis , 19 [ 2 . 8 % ] patients ( n = 680 ) experienced 1 other thrombovascular event ( TVE ) each ( 12 [ 3 . 5 % ] in the epoetin alfa group and 7 [ 2 . 1 % ] in the SOC group ) .
Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis is strongly recommended when ESAs are used for the reduction of allogeneic RBC transfusions in surgical patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Increased mortality was observed in a randomized , placebo - controlled study of PROCRIT in adult patients who were undergoing CABG surgery ( 7 deaths in 126 patients randomized to PROCRIT versus no deaths among 56 patients receiving placebo ) .
Four of these deaths occurred during the period of study drug administration and all 4 deaths were associated with thrombotic events .
5 . 2 Increased Mortality and / or Increased Risk of Tumor Progression or Recurrence in Patients With Cancer ESAs resulted in decreased locoregional control / progression - free survival ( PFS ) and / or overall survival ( OS ) ( see Table 2 ) .
Adverse effects on PFS and / or OS were observed in studies of patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer ( Studies 1 , 2 , and 4 ) , lymphoid malignancy ( Study 3 ) , and cervical cancer ( Study 5 ) ; in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy ( Studies 6 and 7 ) ; and in patients with non - small cell lung cancer or various malignancies who were not receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy ( Studies 8 and 9 ) .

Doses were titrated to achieve and maintain the lowest hemoglobin level sufficient to avoid transfusion and not to exceed 12 g / dL .
Decreased Overall Survival Study 2 was described in the previous section [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Mortality at 4 months ( 8 . 7 % vs . 3 . 4 % ) was significantly higher in the epoetin alfa arm .
The most common investigator - attributed cause of death within the first 4 months was disease progression ; 28 of 41 deaths in the epoetin alfa arm and 13 of 16 deaths in the placebo arm were attributed to disease progression .
Investigator - assessed time to tumor progression was not different between the 2 groups .
Survival at 12 months was significantly lower in the epoetin alfa arm ( 70 % vs . 76 % ; HR 1 . 37 , 95 % CI : 1 . 07 , 1 . 75 ; p = 0 . 012 ) .
Study 3 was a randomized , double - blind study ( darbepoetin alfa vs . placebo ) conducted in 344 anemic patients with lymphoid malignancy receiving chemotherapy .
With a median follow - up of 29 months , overall mortality rates were significantly higher among patients randomized to darbepoetin alfa as compared to placebo ( HR 1 . 36 , 95 % CI : 1 . 02 , 1 . 82 ) .
Study 8 was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind study ( epoetin alfa vs . placebo ) in which patients with advanced non - small cell lung cancer receiving only palliative radiotherapy or no active therapy were treated with epoetin alfa to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g / dL .
Following an interim analysis of 70 patients ( planned accrual 300 patients ) , a significant difference in survival in favor of the patients in the placebo arm of the study was observed ( median survival 63 vs . 129 days ; HR 1 . 84 ; p = 0 . 04 ) .
Study 9 was a randomized , double - blind study ( darbepoetin alfa vs . placebo ) in 989 anemic patients with active malignant disease , neither receiving nor planning to receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy .
There was no evidence of a statistically significant reduction in proportion of patients receiving RBC transfusions .
The median survival was shorter in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group than in the placebo group ( 8 months vs . 10 . 8 months ; HR 1 . 30 , 95 % CI : 1 . 07 , 1 . 57 ) .
Decreased Progression - free Survival and Overall Survival Study 1 was a randomized , open - label , multicenter study in 2 , 098 anemic women with metastatic breast cancer , who received first line or second line chemotherapy .
This was a noninferiority study designed to rule out a 15 % risk increase in tumor progression or death of epoetin alfa plus standard of care ( SOC ) as compared with SOC alone .
At the time of clinical data cutoff , the median progression free survival ( PFS ) per investigator assessment of disease progression was 7 . 4 months in each arm ( HR 1 . 09 , 95 % CI : 0 . 99 , 1 . 20 ) , indicating the study objective was not met .
There were more deaths from disease progression in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm ( 59 % vs . 56 % ) and more thrombotic vascular events in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm ( 3 % vs . 1 % ) .
At the final analysis , 1653 deaths were reported ( 79 . 8 % subjects in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group and 77 . 8 % subjects in the SOC group ) .
Median overall survival in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group was 17 . 8 months compared with 18 . 0 months in the SOC alone group ( HR 1 . 07 , 95 % CI : 0 . 97 , 1 . 18 ) .
Study 4 was a randomized , open - label , controlled , factorial design study in which darbepoetin alfa was administered to prevent anemia in 733 women receiving neo - adjuvant breast cancer treatment .
A final analysis was performed after a median follow - up of approximately 3 years .
The 3 - year survival rate was lower ( 86 % vs . 90 % ; HR 1 . 42 , 95 % CI : 0 . 93 , 2 . 18 ) and the 3 - year relapse - free survival rate was lower ( 72 % vs . 78 % ; HR 1 . 33 , 95 % CI : 0 . 99 , 1 . 79 ) in the darbepoetin alfa - treated arm compared to the control arm .
Study 5 was a randomized , open - label , controlled study that enrolled 114 of a planned 460 cervical cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
Patients were randomized to receive epoetin alfa to maintain hemoglobin between 12 and 14 g / dL or to RBC transfusion support as needed .
The study was terminated prematurely due to an increase in thromboembolic adverse reactions in epoetin alfa - treated patients compared to control ( 19 % vs . 9 % ) .
Both local recurrence ( 21 % vs . 20 % ) and distant recurrence ( 12 % vs . 7 % ) were more frequent in epoetin alfa - treated patients compared to control .
Progression - free survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa - treated group compared to control ( 59 % vs . 62 % ; HR 1 . 06 , 95 % CI : 0 . 58 , 1 . 91 ) .
Overall survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa - treated group compared to control ( 61 % vs . 71 % ; HR 1 . 28 , 95 % CI : 0 . 68 , 2 . 42 ) .
Study 6 was a randomized , placebo - controlled study in 351 head and neck cancer patients where epoetin beta or placebo was administered to achieve target hemoglobins ≥ 14 and ≥ 15 g / dL for women and men , respectively .
Locoregional progression - free survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta ( HR 1 . 62 , 95 % CI : 1 . 22 , 2 . 14 ; p = 0 . 0008 ) with medians of 406 days and 745 days in the epoetin beta and placebo arms , respectively .
Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta ( HR 1 . 39 , 95 % CI : 1 . 05 , 1 . 84 ; p = 0 . 02 ) .
Decreased Locoregional Control Study 7 was a randomized , open - label , controlled study conducted in 522 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck receiving radiation therapy alone ( no chemotherapy ) who were randomized to receive darbepoetin alfa to maintain hemoglobin levels of 14 to 15 . 5 g / dL or no darbepoetin alfa .
An interim analysis performed on 484 patients demonstrated that locoregional control at 5 years was significantly shorter in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa ( RR 1 . 44 , 95 % CI : 1 . 06 , 1 . 96 ; p = 0 . 02 ) .
Overall survival was shorter in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa ( RR 1 . 28 , 95 % CI : 0 . 98 , 1 . 68 ; p = 0 . 08 ) .
5 . 3 Hypertension PROCRIT is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension .
Following initiation and titration of PROCRIT , approximately 25 % of patients on dialysis required initiation of or increases in antihypertensive therapy ; hypertensive encephalopathy and seizures have been reported in patients with CKD receiving PROCRIT .
Appropriately control hypertension prior to initiation of and during treatment with PROCRIT .
Reduce or withhold PROCRIT if blood pressure becomes difficult to control .
Advise patients of the importance of compliance with antihypertensive therapy and dietary restrictions [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 4 Seizures PROCRIT increases the risk of seizures in patients with CKD .
During the first several months following initiation of PROCRIT , monitor patients closely for premonitory neurologic symptoms .
Advise patients to contact their healthcare practitioner for new - onset seizures , premonitory symptoms or change in seizure frequency .
5 . 5 Lack or Loss of Hemoglobin Response to PROCRIT For lack or loss of hemoglobin response to PROCRIT , initiate a search for causative factors ( e . g . , iron deficiency , infection , inflammation , bleeding ) .
If typical causes of lack or loss of hemoglobin response are excluded , evaluate for PRCA [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
In the absence of PRCA , follow dosing recommendations for management of patients with an insufficient hemoglobin response to PROCRIT therapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 6 Pure Red Cell Aplasia Cases of PRCA and of severe anemia , with or without other cytopenias that arise following the development of neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin have been reported in patients treated with PROCRIT .
This has been reported predominantly in patients with CKD receiving ESAs by subcutaneous administration .
PRCA has also been reported in patients receiving ESAs for anemia related to hepatitis C treatment ( an indication for which PROCRIT is not approved ) .
If severe anemia and low reticulocyte count develop during treatment with PROCRIT , withhold PROCRIT and evaluate patients for neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin .
Contact Janssen Products , LP at 1 - 800 - JANSSEN ( 1 - 800 - 526 - 7736 ) to perform assays for binding and neutralizing antibodies .
Permanently discontinue PROCRIT in patients who develop PRCA following treatment with PROCRIT or other erythropoietin protein drugs .
Do not switch patients to other ESAs .
5 . 7 Serious Allergic Reactions Serious allergic reactions , including anaphylactic reactions , angioedema , bronchospasm , skin rash , and urticaria may occur with PROCRIT .
Immediately and permanently discontinue PROCRIT and administer appropriate therapy if a serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs .
5 . 8 Severe Cutaneous Reactions Blistering and skin exfoliation reactions including Erythema multiforme and Stevens - Johnson Syndrome ( SJS ) / Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis ( TEN ) , have been reported in patients treated with ESAs ( including PROCRIT ) in the postmarketing setting .
Discontinue PROCRIT therapy immediately if a severe cutaneous reaction , such as SJS / TEN , is suspected .
5 . 9 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative PROCRIT from multiple - dose vials contains benzyl alcohol and is contraindicated for use in neonates , infants , pregnant women , and lactating women [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
In addition , do not mix PROCRIT with bacteriostatic saline ( which also contains benzyl alcohol ) when administering PROCRIT to these patient populations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Serious and fatal reactions including " gasping syndrome " can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol - preserved drugs , including PROCRIT multiple - dose vials .
The " gasping syndrome " is characterized by central nervous system depression , metabolic acidosis , and gasping respirations .
There is a potential for similar risks to fetuses and infants exposed to benzyl alcohol in utero or in breast - fed milk , respectively .
PROCRIT multiple - dose vials contain 11 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL .
The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 2 , and 8 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 10 Risk of Infectious Diseases Due to Albumin ( Human ) Content PROCRIT contains albumin , a derivative of human blood [ see Description ( 11 ) ] .
Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes , it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases .
A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) also is considered extremely remote .
No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for albumin .
5 . 11 Dialysis Management Patients may require adjustments in their dialysis prescriptions after initiation of PROCRIT .
Patients receiving PROCRIT may require increased anticoagulation with heparin to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal circuit during hemodialysis .

• Surgery Patients : Adverse reactions in ≥ 5 % of PROCRIT - treated patients in clinical studies were nausea , vomiting , pruritus , headache , injection site pain , chills , deep vein thrombosis , cough , and hypertension ( 6 . 1 ) .
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Janssen Products , LP at 1 - 800 - JANSSEN ( 1 - 800 - 526 - 7736 ) or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Adult Patients Three double - blind , placebo - controlled studies , including 244 patients with CKD on dialysis , were used to identify the adverse reactions to PROCRIT .
In these studies , the mean age of patients was 48 years ( range : 20 to 80 years ) .
One hundred and thirty - three ( 55 % ) patients were men .
The racial distribution was as follows : 177 ( 73 % ) patients were white , 48 ( 20 % ) patients were black , 4 ( 2 % ) patients were Asian , 12 ( 5 % ) patients were other , and racial information was missing for 3 ( 1 % ) patients .
Two double - blind , placebo - controlled studies , including 210 patients with CKD not on dialysis , were used to identify the adverse reactions to PROCRIT .
In these studies , the mean age of patients was 57 years ( range : 24 to 79 years ) .
One hundred and twenty - one ( 58 % ) patients were men .
The racial distribution was as follows : 164 ( 78 % ) patients were white , 38 ( 18 % ) patients were black , 3 ( 1 % ) patients were Asian , 3 ( 1 % ) patients were other , and racial information was missing for 2 ( 1 % ) patients .
The adverse reactions with a reported incidence of ≥ 5 % in PROCRIT - treated patients and that occurred at a ≥ 1 % higher frequency than in placebo - treated patients are shown in the table below : Table 3 : Adverse Reactions in Patients With CKD on DialysisAdverse Reaction PROCRIT - treated Patients ( n = 148 ) Placebo - treated Patients ( n = 96 ) Hypertension 27 . 7 % 12 . 5 % Arthralgia 16 . 2 % 3 . 1 % Muscle spasm 7 . 4 % 6 . 3 % Pyrexia 10 . 1 % 8 . 3 % Dizziness 9 . 5 % 8 . 3 % Medical Device Malfunction ( artificial kidney clotting during dialysis ) 8 . 1 % 4 . 2 % Vascular Occlusion ( vascular access thrombosis ) 8 . 1 % 2 . 1 % Upper respiratory tract infection 6 . 8 % 5 . 2 % An additional serious adverse reaction that occurred in less than 5 % of epoetin alfa - treated dialysis patients and greater than placebo was thrombosis ( 2 . 7 % PROCRIT and 1 % placebo ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The adverse reactions with a reported incidence of ≥ 5 % in PROCRIT - treated patients and that occurred at a ≥ 1 % higher frequency than in placebo - treated patients are shown in the table below : Table 4 : Adverse Reactions in Patients With CKD Not on DialysisAdverse Reactions PROCRIT - treated Patients ( n = 131 ) Placebo - treated Patients ( n = 79 ) Hypertension 13 . 7 % 10 . 1 % Arthralgia 12 . 2 % 7 . 6 % Additional serious adverse reactions that occurred in less than 5 % of epoetin alfa - treated patients not on dialysis and greater than placebo were erythema ( 0 . 8 % PROCRIT and 0 % placebo ) and myocardial infarction ( 0 . 8 % PROCRIT and 0 % placebo ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients with CKD on dialysis , the pattern of adverse reactions was similar to that found in adults .
Zidovudine - treated Patients with HIV - infection A total of 297 zidovudine - treated patients with HIV - infection were studied in 4 placebo - controlled studies .
A total of 144 ( 48 % ) patients were randomly assigned to receive PROCRIT and 153 ( 52 % ) patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo .
PROCRIT was administered at doses between 100 and 200 Units / kg 3 times weekly subcutaneously for up to 12 weeks .
For the combined PROCRIT treatment groups , a total of 141 ( 98 % ) men and 3 ( 2 % ) women between the ages of 24 and 64 years were enrolled .
The racial distribution of the combined PROCRIT treatment groups was as follows : 129 ( 90 % ) white , 8 ( 6 % ) black , 1 ( 1 % ) Asian , and 6 ( 4 % ) other .
In double - blind , placebo - controlled studies of 3 months duration involving approximately 300 zidovudine - treated patients with HIV - infection , adverse reactions with an incidence of ≥ 1 % in patients treated with PROCRIT were : Table 5 : Adverse Reactions in Zidovudine - treated Patients with HIV - infectionAdverse Reaction PROCRIT ( n = 144 ) Placebo ( n = 153 ) Pyrexia 42 % 34 % Cough 26 % 14 % Rash 19 % 7 % Injection site irritation 7 % 4 % Urticaria 3 % 1 % Respiratory tract congestion 1 % Not reported Pulmonary embolism 1 % Not reported Patients with Cancer on Chemotherapy The data below were obtained in Study C1 , a 16 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled study that enrolled 344 patients with anemia secondary to chemotherapy .
There were 333 patients who were evaluable for safety ; 168 of 174 patients ( 97 % ) randomized to PROCRIT received at least 1 dose of study drug , and 165 of 170 patients ( 97 % ) randomized to placebo received at least 1 placebo dose .
For the once weekly PROCRIT - treatment group , a total of 76 men ( 45 % ) and 92 women ( 55 % ) between the ages of 20 and 88 years were treated .
The racial distribution of the PROCRIT - treatment group was 158 white ( 94 % ) and 10 black ( 6 % ) .
PROCRIT was administered once weekly for an average of 13 weeks at a dose of 20 , 000 to 60 , 000 IU subcutaneously ( mean weekly dose was 49 , 000 IU ) .
The adverse reactions with a reported incidence of ≥ 5 % in PROCRIT - treated patients that occurred at a higher frequency than in placebo - treated patients are shown in the table below : Table 6 : Adverse Reactions in Patients with CancerAdverse Reaction PROCRIT ( n = 168 ) Placebo ( n = 165 ) Nausea 35 % 30 % Vomiting 20 % 16 % Myalgia 10 % 5 % Arthralgia 10 % 6 % Stomatitis 10 % 8 % Cough 9 % 7 % Weight decrease 9 % 5 % Leukopenia 8 % 7 % Bone pain 7 % 4 % Rash 7 % 5 % Hyperglycemia 6 % 4 % Insomnia 6 % 2 % Headache 5 % 4 % Depression 5 % 4 % Dysphagia 5 % 2 % Hypokalemia 5 % 3 % Thrombosis 5 % 3 % Surgery Patients Four hundred sixty - one patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery were studied in a placebo - controlled study ( S1 ) and a comparative dosing study ( 2 dosing regimens , S2 ) .
A total of 358 patients were randomly assigned to receive PROCRIT and 103 ( 22 % ) patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo .
PROCRIT was administered daily at a dose of 100 to 300 IU / kg subcutaneously for 15 days or at 600 IU / kg once weekly for 4 weeks .
For the combined PROCRIT treatment groups , a total of 90 ( 25 % ) and 268 ( 75 % ) women between the ages of 29 and 89 years were enrolled .
The racial distribution of the combined PROCRIT treatment groups was as follows : 288 ( 80 % ) white , 64 ( 18 % ) black , 1 ( < 1 % ) Asian , and 5 ( 1 % ) other .
The adverse reactions with a reported incidence of ≥ 1 % in PROCRIT - treated patients that occurred at a higher frequency than in placebo - treated patients are shown in the table below : Table 7 : Adverse Reactions in Surgery PatientsAdverse Reaction Study S1 Study S2 PROCRIT 300 U / kg PROCRIT 100 U / kg Placebo PROCRIT 600 U / kg × 4 weeks PROCRIT 300 U / kg × 15 days ( n = 112 ) [ 1 ] ( n = 101 ) null ( n = 103 ) null ( n = 73 ) [ 2 ] ( n = 72 ) null Nausea 47 % 43 % 45 % 45 % 56 % Vomiting 21 % 12 % 14 % 19 % 28 % Pruritus 16 % 16 % 14 % 12 % 21 % Headache 13 % 11 % 9 % 10 % 18 % Injection site pain 13 % 9 % 8 % 12 % 11 % Chills 7 % 4 % 1 % 1 % 0 % Deep vein thrombosis 6 % 3 % 3 % 0 % [ 3 ] 0 % null Cough 5 % 4 % 0 % 4 % 4 % Hypertension 5 % 3 % 5 % 5 % 6 % Rash 2 % 2 % 1 % 3 % 3 % Edema 1 % 2 % 2 % 1 % 3 % [ 1 ] Study included patients undergoing orthopedic surgery treated with PROCRIT or placebo for 15 days .
[ 2 ] Study included patients undergoing orthopedic surgery treated with PROCRIT 600 U / kg weekly for 4 weeks or 300 U / kg daily for 15 days .
[ 3 ] DVTs were determined by clinical symptoms .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of PROCRIT .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Seizures [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • PRCA [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Serious allergic reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • Injection site reactions , including irritation and pain • Porphyria • Severe Cutaneous Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] 6 . 3 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to epoetin alfa with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading .
Neutralizing antibodies to epoetin alfa that cross - react with endogenous erythropoietin and other ESAs can result in PRCA or severe anemia ( with or without other cytopenias ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary PROCRIT from multiple - dose vials contains benzyl alcohol and is contraindicated in pregnant women [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
When therapy with PROCRIT is needed during pregnancy , use a benzyl alcohol - free formulation ( i . e . , single - dose vial ) .
Do not mix PROCRIT with bacteriostatic saline when administering to pregnant women because it contains benzyl alcohol ( see Clinical Considerations ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
The limited available data on PROCRIT use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
In animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies , adverse fetal effects including embryo - fetal death , skeletal anomalies , and growth defects occurred when pregnant rats received epoetin alfa at doses approximating the clinical recommended starting doses ( see Data ) .
Consider the benefits and risks of PROCRIT single - dose vials for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing PROCRIT to a pregnant woman .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
.
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4 % and 15 – 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions The multiple - dose vials of PROCRIT contain benzyl alcohol .
The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
There is a potential for similar risks to fetuses exposed to benzyl alcohol in utero .
Data Human Data There are reports of pregnant women with anemia alone or anemia associated with severe renal disease and other hematologic disorders who received PROCRIT .
Polyhydramnios and intrauterine growth restriction were reported in women with chronic renal disease , which is associated with an increased risk for these adverse pregnancy outcomes .
Due to the limited number of exposed pregnancies and multiple confounding factors ( such as underlying maternal conditions , other maternal medications , and gestational timing of exposure ) , these published case reports and studies do not reliably estimate the frequency , presence or absence of adverse outcomes .
Animal Data When rats received PROCRIT at doses greater than or equal to 100 Units / kg / day during mating and through early pregnancy ( dosing stopped prior to organogenesis ) , there were slight increases in the incidences of pre - and post - implantation loss , and a decrease in live fetuses in the presence of maternal toxicity ( red limbs / pinna , focal splenic capsular toxicity , increased organ weights ) .
This animal dose level of 100 Units / kg / day may approximate the clinical recommended starting dose , depending on the treatment indication .
When pregnant rats and rabbits received intravenous doses of up to 500 mg / kg / day of PROCRIT only during organogenesis ( gestational days 7 to 17 in rats and gestational days 6 to 18 in rabbits ) , no teratogenic effects were observed in the offspring .
The offspring ( F1 generation ) of the treated rats were observed postnatally ; rats from the F1 generation reached maturity and were mated ; no PROCRIT - related effects were apparent for their offspring ( F2 generation fetuses ) .
When pregnant rats received PROCRIT at doses of 500 Units / kg / day late in pregnancy ( after the period of organogenesis from day 17 of gestation through day 21 of lactation ) , pups exhibited decreased number of caudal vertebrae , decreased body weight gain , and delayed appearance of abdominal hair , eyelid opening , and ossification in the presence of maternal toxicity ( red limbs / pinna , increased organ weights ) .
This animal dose level of 500 U / kg / day is approximately five times the clinical recommended starting dose depending on the patient ' s treatment indication .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary PROCRIT from multiple - dose vials contains benzyl alcohol and is contraindicated in lactating women [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
Advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed for at least 2 weeks after the last dose .
The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
There is a potential for similar risks to infants exposed to benzyl alcohol through human milk .
Do not mix PROCRIT with bacteriostatic saline containing benzyl alcohol , if administering PROCRIT to a lactating woman [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
There is no information regarding the presence of PROCRIT in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
However , endogenous erythropoietin is present in human milk .
Because many drugs are present in human milk , caution should be exercised when PROCRIT from single - dose vials is administered to a lactating woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The multiple - dose vials are formulated with benzyl alcohol and are contraindicated for use in neonates and infants [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
When therapy with PROCRIT is needed in neonates and infants , use the single - dose vial , which is a benzyl alcohol - free formulation .
Do not mix the single - dose vials with bacteriostatic saline when administering PROCRIT to neonates or infants because it contains benzyl alcohol [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the " gasping syndrome " occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative .
In these cases , benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg / kg / day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine ( blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0 . 61 to 1 . 378 mmol / L ) .
Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration , seizures , intracranial hemorrhage , hematologic abnormalities , skin breakdown , hepatic and renal failure , hypotension , bradycardia , and cardiovascular collapse .
Preterm , low birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol .
The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients with CKD PROCRIT is indicated in pediatric patients , ages 1 month to 16 years of age , for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD requiring dialysis .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 1 month old have not been established [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Use of PROCRIT in pediatric patients with CKD not requiring dialysis is supported by efficacy in pediatric patients requiring dialysis .
The mechanism of action of PROCRIT is the same for these two populations .
Published literature also has reported the use of PROCRIT in pediatric patients with CKD not requiring dialysis .
Dose - dependent increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit were observed with reductions in transfusion requirements .
The safety data from the pediatric studies and postmarketing reports are similar to those obtained from the studies of PROCRIT in adult patients with CKD [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Postmarketing reports do not indicate a difference in safety profiles in pediatric patients with CKD requiring dialysis and not requiring dialysis .
Pediatric Patients with Cancer on Chemotherapy PROCRIT is indicated in patients 5 to 18 years old for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 5 years of age have not been established [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The safety data from these studies are similar to those obtained from the studies of PROCRIT in adult patients with cancer [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients With HIV - infection Receiving Zidovudine Published literature has reported the use of PROCRIT in 20 zidovudine - treated , anemic , pediatric patients with HIV - infection , ages 8 months to 17 years , treated with 50 to 400 Units / kg subcutaneously or intravenously 2 to 3 times per week .
Increases in hemoglobin levels and in reticulocyte counts and decreases in or elimination of RBC transfusions were observed .
Pharmacokinetics in Neonates Limited pharmacokinetic data from a study of 7 preterm , very low birth weight neonates and 10 healthy adults given intravenous erythropoietin suggested that distribution volume was approximately 1 . 5 to 2 times higher in the preterm neonates than in the healthy adults , and clearance was approximately 3 times higher in the preterm neonates than in the healthy adults .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 4553 patients who received PROCRIT in the 6 studies for treatment of anemia due to CKD not receiving dialysis , 2726 ( 60 % ) were age 65 years and over , while 1418 ( 31 % ) were 75 years and over .
Of the 757 patients who received PROCRIT in the 3 studies of CKD patients on dialysis , 361 ( 47 % ) were age 65 years and over , while 100 ( 13 % ) were 75 years and over .
No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric and younger patients .
Dose selection and adjustment for an elderly patient should be individualized to achieve and maintain the target hemoglobin [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Among 778 patients enrolled in the 3 clinical studies of PROCRIT for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant chemotherapy , 419 received PROCRIT and 359 received placebo .
Of the 419 who received PROCRIT , 247 ( 59 % ) were age 65 years and over , while 78 ( 19 % ) were 75 years and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric and younger patients .
The dose requirements for PROCRIT in geriatric and younger patients within the 3 studies were similar .
Among 1731 patients enrolled in the 6 clinical studies of PROCRIT for reduction of allogeneic RBC transfusions in patients undergoing elective surgery , 1085 received PROCRIT and 646 received placebo or standard of care treatment .
Of the 1085 patients who received PROCRIT , 582 ( 54 % ) were age 65 years and over , while 245 ( 23 % ) were 75 years and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric and younger patients .
The dose requirements for PROCRIT in geriatric and younger patients within the 4 studies using the 3 times weekly schedule and 2 studies using the weekly schedule were similar .
Insufficient numbers of patients age 65 years or older were enrolled in clinical studies of PROCRIT for the treatment of patients treated with zidovudine for HIV - infection to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE PROCRIT overdosage can cause hemoglobin levels above the desired level , which should be managed with discontinuation or reduction of PROCRIT dosage and / or with phlebotomy , as clinically indicated [ see Pharmacodynamics ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Cases of severe hypertension have been observed following overdose with ESAs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action PROCRIT stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as endogenous erythropoietin .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics PROCRIT increases the reticulocyte count within 10 days of initiation , followed by increases in the RBC count , hemoglobin , and hematocrit , usually within 2 to 6 weeks .
The rate of hemoglobin increase varies among patients and is dependent upon the dose of PROCRIT administered .
For correction of anemia in hemodialysis patients , a greater biologic response is not observed at doses exceeding 300 Units / kg 3 times weekly .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In adult and pediatric patients with CKD , the elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of plasma erythropoietin after intravenous administration of PROCRIT ranged from 4 to 13 hours .
After subcutaneous administration , Cmax was achieved within 5 to 24 hours .
The t1 / 2 in adult patients with serum creatinine greater than 3 mg / dL was similar between those not on dialysis and those maintained on dialysis .
The pharmacokinetic data indicate no apparent difference in PROCRIT t1 / 2 among adult patients above or below 65 years of age .
A pharmacokinetic study comparing 150 Units / kg subcutaneous 3 times weekly to 40 , 000 Units subcutaneous weekly dosing regimen was conducted for 4 weeks in healthy subjects ( n = 12 ) and for 6 weeks in anemic cancer patients ( n = 32 ) receiving cyclic chemotherapy .
There was no accumulation of serum erythropoietin after the 2 dosing regimens during the study period .
The 40 , 000 Units weekly regimen had a higher Cmax ( 3 - to 7 - fold ) , longer Tmax ( 2 - to 3 - fold ) , higher AUC0 – 168 h ( 2 - to 3 - fold ) of erythropoietin and lower clearance ( CL ) ( 50 % ) than the 150 Units / kg 3 times weekly regimen .
In anemic cancer patients , the average t1 / 2 was similar ( 40 hours with range of 16 to 67 hours ) after both dosing regimens .
After the 150 Units / kg 3 times weekly dosing , the values of Tmax and CL were similar ( 13 . 3 ± 12 . 4 vs . 14 . 2 ± 6 . 7 hours , and 20 . 2 ± 15 . 9 vs . 23 . 6 ± 9 . 5 mL / hr / kg ) between week 1 when patients were receiving chemotherapy ( n = 14 ) and week 3 when patients were not receiving chemotherapy ( n = 4 ) .
Differences were observed after the 40 , 000 Units weekly dosing with longer Tmax ( 38 ± 18 hours ) and lower CL ( 9 . 2 ± 4 . 7 mL / hr / kg ) during week 1 when patients were receiving chemotherapy ( n = 18 ) compared with those ( 22 ± 4 . 5 hours , 13 . 9 ± 7 . 6 mL / hr / kg , respectively ) during week 3 when patients were not receiving chemotherapy ( n = 7 ) .
The pharmacokinetic profile of PROCRIT in pediatric patients appeared similar to that of adults .
The pharmacokinetics of PROCRIT has not been studied in patients with HIV - infection .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of PROCRIT has not been evaluated .
PROCRIT was not mutagenic or clastogenic under the conditions tested : PROCRIT was negative in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay ( Ames test ) , in the in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation assay ( the hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyl transferase [ HGPRT ] locus ) , in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in mammalian cells , and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
When administered intravenously to male and female rats prior to and during mating , and to females through the beginning of implantation ( up to gestational day 7 ; dosing stopped prior to the beginning of organogenesis ) , doses of 100 and 500 Units / kg / day of PROCRIT caused slight increases in pre - implantation loss , post - implantation loss and decreases in the incidence of live fetuses .
It is not clear whether these effects reflect a drug effect on the uterine environment or on the conceptus .
This animal dose level of 100 Units / kg / day approximates the clinical recommended starting dose , depending on the patient ' s treatment indication , but may be lower than the clinical dose in patients whose doses have been adjusted .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease Adult Patients on Dialysis Patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis : ESA effects on rates of transfusion In clinical studies of patients with CKD on dialysis , PROCRIT increased hemoglobin levels and decreased the need for RBC transfusion .
Overall , more than 95 % of patients were RBC transfusion - independent after receiving PROCRIT for 3 months .
In clinical studies at starting doses of 50 to 150 Units / kg 3 times weekly , adult patients responded with an average rate of hemoglobin rise as presented in Table 8 .
Table 8 : Average Rate of Hemoglobin Rise in 2 WeeksStarting Dose ( 3 Times Weekly Intravenously ) Hemoglobin Increase in 2 Weeks 50 Units / kg 0 . 5 g / dL 100 Units / kg 0 . 8 g / dL 150 Units / kg 1 . 2 g / dL The safety and efficacy of PROCRIT were evaluated in 13 clinical studies involving intravenous administration to a total of 1010 patients on dialysis with anemia .
Overall , more than 90 % of the patients treated with PROCRIT experienced improvement in hemoglobin concentrations .
In the 3 largest of these clinical studies , the median maintenance dose necessary to maintain the hemoglobin between 10 to 12 g / dL was approximately 75 Units / kg 3 times weekly .
More than 95 % of patients were able to avoid RBC transfusions .
In the largest US multicenter study , approximately 65 % of the patients received doses of 100 Units / kg 3 times weekly or less to maintain their hemoglobin at approximately 11 . 7 g / dL .
Almost 10 % of patients received a dose of 25 Units / kg or less , and approximately 10 % received a dose of more than 200 Units / kg 3 times weekly to maintain their hemoglobin at this level .
In the Normal Hematocrit Study , the yearly transfusion rate was 51 . 5 % in the lower hemoglobin group ( 10 g / dL ) and 32 . 4 % in the higher hemoglobin group ( 14 g / dL ) .
Other ESA trials In a 26 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , 118 patients on dialysis with an average hemoglobin of approximately 7 g / dL were randomized to either PROCRIT or placebo .
By the end of the study , average hemoglobin increased to approximately 11 g / dL in the PROCRIT - treated patients and remained unchanged in patients receiving placebo .
PROCRIT - treated patients experienced improvements in exercise tolerance and patient - reported physical functioning at month 2 that were maintained throughout the study .
A multicenter , unit - dose study was also conducted in 119 patients receiving peritoneal dialysis who self - administered PROCRIT subcutaneously .
Patients responded to PROCRIT administered subcutaneously in a manner similar to patients receiving intravenous administration .
Pediatric Patients with CKD on Dialysis The safety and efficacy of PROCRIT were studied in a placebo - controlled , randomized study of 113 pediatric patients with anemia ( hemoglobin ≤ 9 g / dL ) undergoing peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis .
The initial dose of PROCRIT was 50 Units / kg intravenously or subcutaneously 3 times weekly .
The dose of study drug was titrated to achieve either a hemoglobin of 10 to 12 g / dL or an absolute increase in hemoglobin of 2 g / dL over baseline .
At the end of the initial 12 weeks , a statistically significant rise in mean hemoglobin ( 3 . 1 g / dL vs . 0 . 3 g / dL ) was observed only in the PROCRIT arm .
The proportion of pediatric patients achieving a hemoglobin of 10 g / dL , or an increase in hemoglobin of 2 g / dL over baseline , at any time during the first 12 weeks was higher in the PROCRIT arm ( 96 % vs . 58 % ) .
Within 12 weeks of initiating PROCRIT therapy , 92 . 3 % of the pediatric patients were RBC transfusion independent as compared to 65 . 4 % who received placebo .
Among patients who received 36 weeks of PROCRIT , hemodialysis patients received a higher median maintenance dose [ 167 Units / kg / week ( n = 28 ) vs . 76 Units / kg / week ( n = 36 ) ] and took longer to achieve a hemoglobin of 10 to 12 g / dL ( median time to response 69 days vs . 32 days ) than patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis .
Adult Patients With CKD Not Requiring Dialysis Four clinical studies were conducted in patients with CKD not on dialysis involving 181 patients treated with PROCRIT .
These patients responded to PROCRIT therapy in a manner similar to that observed in patients on dialysis .
Patients with CKD not on dialysis demonstrated a dose - dependent and sustained increase in hemoglobin when PROCRIT was administered by either an intravenous or subcutaneous route , with similar rates of rise of hemoglobin when PROCRIT was administered by either route .
Patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis : ESA effects on rates of transfusion In TREAT , a randomized , double - blind trial of 4038 patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes not on dialysis , a post - hoc analysis showed that the proportion of patients receiving RBC transfusions was lower in patients administered an ESA to target a hemoglobin of 13 g / dL compared to the control arm in which an ESA was administered intermittently if hemoglobin concentration decreased to less than 9 g / dL ( 15 % versus 25 % , respectively ) .
In CHOIR , a randomized open - label study of 1432 patients with CKD not on dialysis , use of epoetin alfa to target a higher ( 13 . 5 g / dL ) versus lower ( 11 . 3 g / dL ) hemoglobin goal did not reduce the use of RBC transfusions .
In each trial , no benefits occurred for the cardiovascular or end - stage renal disease outcomes .
In each trial , the potential benefit of ESA therapy was offset by worse cardiovascular safety outcomes resulting in an unfavorable benefit - risk profile [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
ESA Effects on rates of death and other serious cardiac adverse reactions Three randomized outcome trials ( Normal Hematocrit Study [ NHS ] , Correction of Anemia with Epoetin Alfa in Chronic Kidney Disease [ CHOIR ] , and Trial of Darbepoetin Alfa in Type 2 Diabetes and CKD [ TREAT ] ) have been conducted in patients with CKD using Epogen / PROCRIT / Aranesp to target higher vs . lower hemoglobin levels .
Though these trials were designed to establish a cardiovascular or renal benefit of targeting higher hemoglobin levels , in all 3 studies , patients randomized to the higher hemoglobin target experienced worse cardiovascular outcomes and showed no reduction in progression to ESRD .
In each trial , the potential benefit of ESA therapy was offset by worse cardiovascular safety outcomes resulting in an unfavorable benefit - risk profile [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
14 . 2 Zidovudine - treated Patients With HIV - infection The safety and efficacy of PROCRIT were evaluated in 4 placebo - controlled studies enrolling 297 anemic patients ( hemoglobin < 10 g / dL ) with HIV - infection receiving concomitant therapy with zidovudine .
In the subgroup of patients ( 89 / 125 PROCRIT and 88 / 130 placebo ) with pre - study endogenous serum erythropoietin levels ≤ 500 mUnits / mL , PROCRIT reduced the mean cumulative number of units of blood transfused per patient by approximately 40 % as compared to the placebo group .
Among those patients who required RBC transfusions at baseline , 43 % of patients treated with PROCRIT versus 18 % of placebo - treated patients were RBC transfusion - independent during the second and third months of therapy .
PROCRIT therapy also resulted in significant increases in hemoglobin in comparison to placebo .
When examining the results according to the weekly dose of zidovudine received during month 3 of therapy , there was a statistically significant reduction ( p < 0 . 003 ) in RBC transfusion requirements in patients treated with PROCRIT ( n = 51 ) compared to placebo - treated patients ( n = 54 ) whose mean weekly zidovudine dose was ≤ 4200 mg / week .
Approximately 17 % of the patients with endogenous serum erythropoietin levels ≤ 500 mUnits / mL receiving PROCRIT in doses from 100 to 200 Units / kg 3 times weekly achieved a hemoglobin of 12 . 7 g / dL without administration of RBC transfusions or significant reduction in zidovudine dose .
In the subgroup of patients whose pre - study endogenous serum erythropoietin levels were > 500 mUnits / mL , PROCRIT therapy did not reduce RBC transfusion requirements or increase hemoglobin compared to the corresponding responses in placebo - treated patients .
14 . 3 Patients with Cancer on Chemotherapy The safety and effectiveness of PROCRIT was assessed in two multicenter , randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , placebo - controlled , double - blind studies ( Study C1 and Study C2 ) and a pooled analysis of six additional randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , multicenter , placebo - controlled , double - blind studies .
All studies were conducted in patients with anemia due to concomitantly administered cancer chemotherapy .
Study C1 enrolled 344 adult patients , Study C2 enrolled 222 pediatric patients , and the pooled analysis contained 131 patients randomized to epoetin alfa or placebo .
In Studies C1 and C2 , efficacy was demonstrated by a reduction in the proportion of patients who received an RBC transfusion , from week 5 through end of the study , with the last - known RBC transfusion status carried forward for patients who discontinued treatment .
In the pooled analysis , efficacy was demonstrated by a reduction in the proportion of patients who received an RBC transfusion from week 5 through end of the study in the subset of patients who were remaining on therapy for 6 or more weeks .
Study C1 Study C1 was conducted in patients with anemia ( hemoglobin < 11 . 5 g / dL for males ; < 10 . 5 g / dL for females ) with non - myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy .
Randomization was stratified by type of malignancy ( lung vs . breast vs . other ) , concurrent radiation therapy planned ( yes or no ) , and baseline hemoglobin ( < 9 g / dL vs . ≥ 9 g / dL ) ; patients were randomized to epoetin alfa 40 , 000 Units ( n = 174 ) or placebo ( n = 170 ) as a weekly subcutaneous injection commencing on the first day of the chemotherapy cycle .
Ninety - one percent of patients were white , 44 % were male , and the median age of patients was 66 years ( range : 20 to 88 years ) .
The proportion of patients withdrawn from the study prior to week 5 was less than 10 % for placebo - treated or epoetin - treated patients .
Per protocol , the last available hemoglobin values from patients who dropped out were included in the efficacy analyses .
Efficacy results are shown in Table 9 .

[ 2 ] Two - sided p < 0 . 001 , logistic regression analysis adjusting for accrual rate and stratification variables .
Study C2 Study C2 was conducted in 222 patients with anemia , ages 5 to 18 , receiving chemotherapy for the treatment of various childhood malignancies .
Randomization was stratified by cancer type ( solid tumors , Hodgkin ' s disease , acute lymphocytic leukemia , vs . non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma ) ; patients were randomized to receive epoetin alfa at 600 Units / kg maximum 40 , 000 Units ( n = 111 ) or placebo ( n = 111 ) as a weekly intravenous injection .
Sixty - nine percent of patients were white , 55 % were male , and the median age of patients was 12 years ( range : 5 to 18 years ) .
Two ( 2 % ) of placebo - treated patients and 3 ( 3 % ) of epoetin alfa - treated patients dropped out of the study prior to week 5 .
There were fewer RBC transfusions from week 5 through the end - of - study in epoetin - alfa treated patients [ 51 % ( 57 / 111 ) ] compared to placebo - treated patients [ 69 % ( 77 / 111 ) ] .
There was no evidence of an improvement in health - related quality of life , including no evidence of an effect on fatigue , energy , or strength in patients receiving PROCRIT as compared to those receiving placebo .
Pooled Analysis ( Three Times Per Week Dosing ) The results of 6 studies of similar design and that randomized 131 patients to epoetin alfa or placebo were pooled to assess the safety and effectiveness of epoetin alfa .
Patients were randomized to receive epoetin alfa at 150 Units / kg ( n = 63 ) or placebo ( n = 68 ) , subcutaneously three times per week for 12 weeks in each study .
Across all studies , 72 patients were treated with concomitant non cisplatin - containing chemotherapy regimens and 59 patients were treated with concomitant cisplatin - containing chemotherapy regimens .
Twelve patients ( 19 % ) in the epoetin alfa arm and 10 patients ( 15 % ) in the placebo - arm dropped out prior to week 6 and are excluded from efficacy analyses .

14 . 4 Surgery Patients The safety and efficacy of PROCRIT were evaluated in a placebo - controlled , double - blind study ( S1 ) enrolling 316 patients scheduled for major , elective orthopedic hip or knee surgery who were expected to require ≥ 2 units of blood and who were not able or willing to participate in an autologous blood donation program .
Patients were stratified into 1 of 3 groups based on their pretreatment hemoglobin [ ≤ 10 g / dL ( n = 2 ) , > 10 to ≤ 13 g / dL ( n = 96 ) , and > 13 to ≤ 15 g / dL ( n = 218 ) ] and then randomly assigned to receive 300 Units / kg PROCRIT , 100 Units / kg PROCRIT , or placebo by subcutaneous injection for 10 days before surgery , on the day of surgery , and for 4 days after surgery .
All patients received oral iron and a low - dose , postoperative warfarin regimen .
Treatment with PROCRIT 300 Units / kg significantly ( p = 0 . 024 ) reduced the risk of allogeneic RBC transfusion in patients with a pretreatment hemoglobin of > 10 to ≤ 13 g / dL ; 5 / 31 ( 16 % ) of patients treated with PROCRIT 300 Units / kg , 6 / 26 ( 23 % ) of patients treated with PROCRIT 100 Units / kg , and 13 / 29 ( 45 % ) of placebo - treated patients were transfused .
There was no significant difference in the number of patients transfused between PROCRIT ( 9 % 300 Units / kg , 6 % 100 Units / kg ) and placebo ( 13 % ) in the > 13 to ≤ 15 g / dL hemoglobin stratum .
There were too few patients in the ≤ 10 g / dL group to determine if PROCRIT is useful in this hemoglobin strata .
In the > 10 to ≤ 13 g / dL pretreatment stratum , the mean number of units transfused per PROCRIT - treated patient ( 0 . 45 units blood for 300 Units / kg , 0 . 42 units blood for 100 Units / kg ) was less than the mean transfused per placebo - treated patient ( 1 . 14 units ) ( overall p = 0 . 028 ) .
In addition , mean hemoglobin , hematocrit , and reticulocyte counts increased significantly during the presurgery period in patients treated with PROCRIT .
PROCRIT was also evaluated in an open - label , parallel - group study ( S2 ) enrolling 145 patients with a pretreatment hemoglobin level of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13 g / dL who were scheduled for major orthopedic hip or knee surgery and who were not participating in an autologous program .
Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 subcutaneous dosing regimens of PROCRIT ( 600 Units / kg once weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery and on the day of surgery , or 300 Units / kg once daily for 10 days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery , and for 4 days after surgery ) .
All patients received oral iron and appropriate pharmacologic anticoagulation therapy .
From pretreatment to presurgery , the mean increase in hemoglobin in the 600 Units / kg weekly group ( 1 . 44 g / dL ) was greater than that observed in the 300 Units / kg daily group .
The mean increase in absolute reticulocyte count was smaller in the weekly group ( 0 . 11 × 106 / mm3 ) compared to the daily group ( 0 . 17 × 106 / mm3 ) .
Mean hemoglobin levels were similar for the 2 treatment groups throughout the postsurgical period .
The erythropoietic response observed in both treatment groups resulted in similar RBC transfusion rates [ 11 / 69 ( 16 % ) in the 600 Units / kg weekly group and 14 / 71 ( 20 % ) in the 300 Units / kg daily group ] .
The mean number of units transfused per patient was approximately 0 . 3 units in both treatment groups .

If you decide to take PROCRIT , your healthcare provider should prescribe the smallest dose of PROCRIT that is necessary to reduce your chance of needing RBC transfusions .
What is PROCRIT ?
PROCRIT is a prescription medicine used to treat anemia .
People with anemia have a lower - than - normal number of RBCs .
PROCRIT works like the human protein called erythropoietin to help your body make more RBCs .

PROCRIT may be used to treat anemia if it is caused by : • Chronic kidney disease ( you may or may not be on dialysis ) .
• Chemotherapy that will be used for at least two months after starting PROCRIT .
• A medicine called zidovudine ( AZT ) used to treat HIV infection .
PROCRIT may also be used to reduce the chance you will need RBC transfusions if you are scheduled for certain surgeries where a lot of blood loss is expected .
If your hemoglobin level stays too high or if your hemoglobin goes up too quickly , this may lead to serious health problems which may result in death .
These serious health problems may happen if you take PROCRIT , even if you do not have an increase in your hemoglobin level .
PROCRIT has not been proven to improve quality of life , fatigue , or well - being .
PROCRIT should not be used for treatment of anemia : • If you have cancer and you will not be receiving chemotherapy that may cause anemia .

• Do not use a single - dose vial of PROCRIT more than one time .
• Do not shake PROCRIT .
• Gather the other supplies you will need for your injection ( vial , syringe , alcohol wipes , cotton ball , and a puncture - proof container for throwing away the syringe and needle ) .
See Figure 1 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • 5 .
Check the date on the PROCRIT vial to be sure that the drug has not expired .
• 6 .
Wash your hands well with soap and water before preparing the medicine .
See Figure 2 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • 7 .
Flip off the protective color cap on the top of the vial .
Do not remove the grey rubber stopper .
Wipe the top of the grey rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe .
See Figures 3 and 4 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 3 Figure 4 • 8 .
Check the package containing the syringe .
If the package has been opened or damaged , do not use that syringe .
Throw away the syringe in the puncture - proof disposable container .
If the syringe package is undamaged , open the package and remove the syringe .
• 9 .
Using a syringe and needle that has been recommended by your healthcare provider , carefully remove the needle cover .
See Figure 5 .
Then draw air into the syringe by pulling back on the plunger .
The amount of air drawn into the syringe should be equal to the amount ( mL or cc ) of the PROCRIT dose prescribed by your healthcare provider .
See Figure 6 .
