Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug product exposure : Hypersensitivity ; contact allergy 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on KERYDIN use in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk for major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In oral animal reproductive studies , administration of tavaborole during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal toxicity and malformations at 570 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose ( MRHD ) based on Area Under the Curve ( AUC ) comparisons in rats and embryofetal toxicity at 155 times the MRHD based on AUC comparisons in rabbits .
Embryofetal toxicity was noted following dermal administration in rabbits up to 36 times the MRHD based on AUC comparisons [ see Data ] .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies carry some risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The background risk of major birth defects in the U . S . general population is 2 % to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data Oral administration : In an oral embryofetal development study in rats , oral doses of 30 , 100 , and 300 mg / kg / day tavaborole were administered during the period of organogenesis ( gestational days 6 – 19 ) to pregnant female rats .
In the presence of maternal toxicity , embryofetal toxicity ( increased embryofetal resorption and / or deaths ) and drug - related skeletal malformations and variations suggestive of delayed development ( i . e . , a delay in ossification ) were noted in fetuses at 300 mg / kg / day tavaborole [ 570 times the MRHD based on AUC comparisons ] .
No developmental toxicity was noted in rats at 100 mg / kg / day tavaborole ( 26 times the MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
In an oral embryofetal development study in rabbits , oral doses of 15 , 50 , and 150 mg / kg / day tavaborole were administered during the period of organogenesis ( gestational days 7 – 19 ) to pregnant female rabbits .
In the presence of maternal toxicity , excessive embryofetal mortality due to post - implantation loss was noted at 150 mg / kg / day tavaborole .
No drug related malformations were noted in rabbits at 150 mg / kg / day tavaborole ( 155 times the MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No embryofetal mortality was noted in rabbits at 50 mg / kg / day tavaborole ( 16 times the MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
In an oral pre - and post - natal development study in rats , oral doses of 15 , 60 , and 100 mg / kg / day tavaborole were administered from the beginning of organogenesis ( gestation day 6 ) through the end of lactation ( lactation day 20 ) .
In the presence of minimal maternal toxicity , no embryofetal toxicity or effects on postnatal development were noted at 100 mg / kg / day ( 29 times the MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
Topical administration : In a dermal embryofetal development study in rabbits , topical doses of 1 % , 5 % , and 10 % tavaborole solution were administered during the period of organogenesis ( gestational days 6 – 28 ) to pregnant female rabbits .
A dose dependent increase in dermal irritation at the treatment site was noted at 5 % and 10 % tavaborole solution .
A decrease in fetal bodyweight was noted at 10 % tavaborole solution .
No drug related malformations were noted in rabbits at 10 % tavaborole solution ( 36 times the MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No embryofetal toxicity was noted in rabbits at 5 % tavaborole solution ( 26 times the MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of KERYDIN in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production after topical application of KERYDIN to women who are breastfeeding .
KERYDIN is systemically absorbed .
The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of KERYDIN to a breastfed infant .
Therefore , the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for KERYDIN and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from KERYDIN or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of KERYDIN were established in patients 6 years of age and older .
Use of KERYDIN in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of KERYDIN in adults with additional data from an open - label pharmacokinetics study of tavaborole in subjects 12 years to less than 17 years old [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In clinical trials of 791 subjects who were exposed to KERYDIN , 19 % were 65 years of age and over , while 4 % were 75 years of age and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action KERYDIN is an oxaborole antifungal [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics At therapeutic doses , KERYDIN is not expected to prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Tavaborole undergoes extensive metabolism .
Renal excretion is the major route of elimination of the metabolites .
In a clinical pharmacology trial of six healthy adult male volunteers who received a single topical application of 5 % 14 C - tavaborole solution , tavaborole conjugates and metabolites were shown to be excreted primarily in the urine .
The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of tavaborole was investigated in 24 adult subjects with distal subungual onychomycosis involving at least 4 toenails ( including at least 1 great toenail ) following a single dose and a 2 - week daily topical application of 200 μL of a 5 % solution of tavaborole to all ten toenails and 2 mm of skin surrounding each toenail .
Steady state was achieved after 14 days of dosing .
After a single dose , the mean ( ± standard deviation ) peak concentration ( Cmax ) of tavaborole was 3 . 5 ± 2 . 3 ng / mL ( n = 21 with measurable concentrations , range 0 . 618 – 10 . 2 ng / mL , LLOQ = 0 . 5 ng / mL ) , and the mean AUClast ± SD was 44 . 4 ± 25 . 5 ng * hr / mL ( n = 21 ) .
After 2 weeks of daily dosing , the mean Cmax ± SD was 5 . 2 ± 3 . 5 ng / mL ( n = 24 , range 1 . 5 – 12 . 8 ng / mL ) , and the mean AUCτ ± SD was 75 . 8 ± 44 . 5 ng * hr / mL .
In another study PK of tavaborole was investigated in 22 subjects aged 12 years to less than 17 years with distal subungual onychomycosis involving at least 4 toenails ( including at least 1 great toenail with at least 20 % involvement ) following once daily application of 5 % solution of tavaborole to all ten toenails and 2 mm of skin surrounding each toenail for 29 days .
On Day 29 , the mean ± SD Cmax was 5 . 9 ± 4 . 9 ng / mL ( n = 21 with measurable concentrations , range 1 . 0 – 16 . 4 ng / mL , LLOQ = 0 . 5 ng / mL ) , and the mean ± SD AUC0 - 24 was 76 . 0 ± 62 . 5 ng * hr / mL .
Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies In vitro studies have shown that tavaborole , at therapeutic concentrations , neither inhibits nor induces cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) enzymes .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of tavaborole is inhibition of fungal protein synthesis .
Tavaborole inhibits protein synthesis by inhibition of an aminoacyl - transfer ribonucleic acid ( tRNA ) synthetase ( AARS ) .
Activity in vitro and in clinical infections Tavaborole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] : Trichophyton rubrum Trichophyton mentagrophytes Mechanism of Resistance Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum strains from isolates collected in the clinical trials have not demonstrated resistance following repeated exposure to tavaborole .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In an oral carcinogenicity study in Sprague - Dawley rats , oral doses of 12 . 5 , 25 , and 50 mg / kg / day tavaborole were administered to rats once daily for 104 weeks .
No drug related neoplastic findings were noted at oral doses up to 50 mg / kg / day tavaborole ( 14 times the MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
In a dermal carcinogenicity study in CD - 1 mice , topical doses of 5 % , 10 % , and 15 % tavaborole solution were administered to mice once daily for 104 weeks .
No drug related neoplastic findings were noted at topical doses up to 15 % tavaborole solution ( 89 times the MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
Tavaborole revealed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests ( Ames assay and Human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay ) and one in vivo genotoxicity test ( rat micronucleus assay ) .
No effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats that were administered oral doses up to 300 mg / kg / day tavaborole ( 107 times the MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) prior to and during early pregnancy .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy and safety of KERYDIN was evaluated in two multicenter , double - blind , randomized , vehicle - controlled trials .
KERYDIN or vehicle was applied once daily for 48 weeks in subjects with 20 % to 60 % clinical involvement of the target toenail , without dermatophytomas or lunula ( matrix ) involvement .
A total of 1194 subjects ( 795 KERYDIN , 399 Vehicle ) 18 to 88 years of age , 82 % male , 84 % white , participated in these two trials .
Efficacy assessments were made at 52 weeks following a 48 - week treatment period .
The Complete Cure efficacy endpoint included negative mycology ( negative KOH wet mount and negative fungal culture ) and Completely Clear Nail ( no clinical evidence of onychomycosis as evidenced by a normal toenail plate , no onycholysis , and no subungual hyperkeratosis ) .
Efficacy results from the two trials are summarized in Table 2 .
