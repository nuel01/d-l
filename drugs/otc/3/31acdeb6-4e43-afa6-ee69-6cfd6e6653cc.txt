2 . 8 Discontinuing Treatment with Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets A gradual reduction in the dose , rather than abrupt cessation , is recommended whenever possible when discontinuing Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets .
In clinical studies with venlafaxine extended - release capsules , tapering was achieved by reducing the daily dosage by 75 mg at one - week intervals .
Given that dosage strengths of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets are not available below 112 . 5 mg , use another venlafaxine extended - release product for discontinuation [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Individualization of tapering may be necessary .
In some patients , discontinuation may need to occur over a period of several months [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
2 . 9 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor ( MAOI ) Antidepressant At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI ( intended to treat psychiatric disorders ) and initiation of therapy with Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets .
In addition , at least 7 days should be allowed after stopping Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .

5 . 1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo - controlled trials of antidepressant drugs ( SSRIs and other antidepressant classes ) that included approximately 77 , 000 adult patients and 4 , 500 pediatric patients , the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant - treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo - treated patients .
There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs , but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied .
There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications , with the highest incidence in patients with MDD .
The drug - placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1 , 000 patients treated are provided in Table 1 .
Table 1 : Risk Differences of the Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo - Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric * and Adult Patients * Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients .
Age Range Drug - Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors per 1 , 000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo < 18 years old 14 additional patients 18 – 24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 – 64 years old 1 fewer patient ≥ 65 years old 6 fewer patients It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children , adolescents , and young adults extends to longer - term use , i . e . , beyond four months .
However , there is substantial evidence from placebo - controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors .
Monitor all antidepressant - treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors , especially during the initial few months of drug therapy , and at times of dosage changes .
Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider .
Consider changing the therapeutic regimen , including possibly discontinuing Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , in patients whose depression is persistently worse , or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors .
5 . 2 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin - norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) , including Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , can precipitate serotonin syndrome , a potentially life - threatening condition .
The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs ( including triptans , tricyclic antidepressants , fentanyl , lithium , tramadol , tryptophan , buspirone , amphetamines , and St . John ’ s Wort ) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin , i . e . , MAOIs [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone .
Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes ( e . g . , agitation , hallucinations , delirium , coma ) , autonomic instability ( e . g . , tachycardia , labile blood pressure , dizziness , diaphoresis , flushing , hyperthermia ) , neuromuscular symptoms ( e . g . , tremor , rigidity , myoclonus , hyperreflexia , incoordination ) , seizures , and gastrointestinal symptoms ( e . g . , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ) .
The concomitant use of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets with MAOIs is contraindicated .
In addition , do not initiate Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue .
No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes ( such as oral tablets or local tissue injection ) .
If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , discontinue Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets before initiating treatment with the MAOI [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 9 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor all patients taking Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets for the emergence of serotonin syndrome .
Discontinue treatment with Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur , and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment .
If concomitant use of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted , inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms .
5 . 3 Elevated Blood Pressure In controlled trials , there were dose - related increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure , as well as cases of sustained hypertension [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor blood pressure before initiating treatment with Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets and regularly during treatment .
Control pre - existing hypertension before initiating treatment with Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets .
Use caution in treating patients with pre - existing hypertension or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions that might be compromised by increases in blood pressure .
Sustained blood pressure elevation can lead to adverse outcomes .
Cases of elevated blood pressure requiring immediate treatment have been reported with venlafaxine extended - release capsules .
Consider dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment for patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure .
Across all clinical studies with venlafaxine , 1 . 4 % of patients in the venlafaxine extended - release capsules treated groups experienced a ≥ 15 mm Hg increase in supine diastolic blood pressure ( SDBP ) ≥ 105 mm Hg , compared to 0 . 9 % of patients in the placebo groups .
Similarly , 1 % of patients in the venlafaxine extended - release capsules treated groups experienced a ≥ 20 mm Hg increase in supine systolic blood pressure ( SSBP ) with blood pressure ≥ 180 mm Hg , compared to 0 . 3 % of patients in the placebo groups [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Treatment with venlafaxine extended - release capsules was associated with sustained hypertension ( defined as SDBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and ≥ 10 mm Hg above baseline for three consecutive on - therapy visits ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
An insufficient number of patients received mean doses of venlafaxine extended - release capsules over 300 mg per day in clinical studies to fully evaluate the incidence of sustained increases in blood pressure at these higher doses .
5 . 4 Increased Risk of Bleeding Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition , including Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , may increase the risk of bleeding events , ranging from ecchymoses , hematomas , epistaxis , petechiae , and gastrointestinal hemorrhage to life - threatening hemorrhage .
Concomitant use of aspirin , Nonsteroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) , warfarin , and other anti - coagulants or other drugs known to affect platelet function may add to this risk .
Case reports and epidemiological studies ( case - control and cohort design ) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding .
Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants .
For patients taking warfarin , carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating , titrating , or discontinuing Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets .
5 . 5 Angle - Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs , including Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy .
Avoid use of antidepressants , including Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles .
5 . 6 Activation of Mania / Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder , treating a depressive episode with Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed / manic episode .
Mania or hypomania was reported in venlafaxine extended - release capsules treated patients in the premarketing studies in MDD ( see Table 2 ) .
Prior to initiating treatment with Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , screen for any personal or family history of bipolar , mania , or hypomania .
Table 2 : Incidence ( % ) of Mania or Hypomania Reported in Venlafaxine Extended - Release Capsules Treated Patients in the Premarketing StudiesIndication Venlafaxine Extended - Release Capsules Placebo MDD 0 . 3 0 . 0 GAD 0 . 0 0 . 2 5 . 7 Discontinuation Syndrome Discontinuation symptoms have been systematically evaluated in patients taking venlafaxine , including prospective analyses of clinical studies in GAD and retrospective surveys of studies in MDD .
Abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction of venlafaxine at various doses has been found to be associated with the appearance of new symptoms , the frequency of which increased with increased dose level and with longer duration of treatment .
Reported symptoms include agitation , anorexia , anxiety , confusion , impaired coordination and balance , diarrhea , dizziness , dry mouth , dysphoric mood , fasciculation , fatigue , flu - like symptoms , headaches , hypomania , insomnia , nausea , nervousness , nightmares , sensory disturbances ( including shock - like electrical sensations ) , somnolence , sweating , tremor , vertigo , and vomiting .
There have been postmarketing reports of serious discontinuation symptoms which can be protracted and severe .
Completed suicide , suicidal thoughts , aggression and violent behavior have been observed in patients during reduction in venlafaxine extended - release capsules dosage , including during discontinuation .
Other postmarketing reports describe visual changes ( such as blurred vision or trouble focusing ) and increased blood pressure after stopping or reducing the dose of venlafaxine extended - release capsules .
During marketing of venlafaxine extended - release capsules , other SNRIs , and SSRIs , there have been reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs , particularly when abrupt , including the following : irritability , lethargy , emotional lability , tinnitus , and seizures .
Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets .
A gradual reduction in the dose , rather than abrupt cessation , is recommended .
If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment , then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered .
Subsequently , the healthcare provider may continue decreasing the dose , but at a more gradual rate .
In some patients , discontinuation may need to occur over a period of several months [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 8 ) ] .
Given that dosage strengths of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets are not available below 112 . 5 mg , use another venlafaxine extended - release product for discontinuation [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 8 Seizures Cases of seizures have been reported with venlafaxine therapy .
Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorder .
Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets should be prescribed with caution in patients with a history of seizures and should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures .
5 . 9 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs , including Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets In many cases , the hyponatremia appears to be the result of the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone ( SIADH ) secretion .
Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol / L have been reported .
Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs .
Also , patients taking diuretics , or those who are otherwise volume - depleted , may be at greater risk [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Consider discontinuation of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia , and institute appropriate medical intervention .
Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache , difficulty concentrating , memory impairment , confusion , weakness , and unsteadiness , which may lead to falls .
Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and / or acute cases have included hallucination , syncope , seizure , coma , respiratory arrest , and death .
5 . 10 Weight and Height Changes in Pediatric Patients Weight Changes The average change in body weight and incidence of weight loss ( percentage of patients who lost 3 . 5 % or more ) in the placebo - controlled pediatric studies in MDD and GAD with venlafaxine extended - release capsules are shown in Tables 3 and 4 .
Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .

The risks associated with longer term use of venlafaxine extended - release capsules were assessed in an open - label MDD study of pediatric patients 6 years to 17 years old who received venlafaxine extended - release capsules for up to six months .
The pediatric patients 6 years to 17 years old in the study had increases in weight that were less than expected , based on data from age - and sex - matched peers .
The difference between observed weight gain and expected weight gain was larger for pediatric patients 6 years to < 12 years old than for pediatric patients ≥ 12 years old .
Height Changes Table 5 shows the average height increase in pediatric patients in the short - term , placebo - controlled MDD and GAD studies with venlafaxine extended - release capsules .
The differences in height increases in GAD and MDD studies were most notable in patients younger than twelve .
Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .

MDD and GAD ( pooled , 8 weeks ) 10 0 . 0 3 5 . 12 Interstitial Lung Disease and Eosinophilic Pneumonia Interstitial lung disease and eosinophilic pneumonia associated with venlafaxine therapy have been rarely reported .
The possibility of these events should be considered in Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets patients who present with progressive dyspnea , cough or chest discomfort .
Such patients should undergo a prompt medical evaluation , and discontinuation of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets should be considered .
5 . 13 Sexual Dysfunction Use of SNRIs , including Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In male patients , SNRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure , decreased libido , and erectile dysfunction .
In female patients , SNRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm .
It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment , because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported .
When evaluating changes in sexual function , obtaining a detailed history ( including timing of symptom onset ) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes , including the underlying psychiatric disorder .
Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling : • Hypersensitivity [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] • Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Serotonin Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Elevated Blood Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Increased Risk of Bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Angle - Closure Glaucoma [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Activation of Mania / Hypomania [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Discontinuation Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • Seizures [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] • Hyponatremia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] • Weight and Height Changes in Pediatric Patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] • Appetite Changes in Pediatric Patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] • Interstitial Lung Disease and Eosinophilic Pneumonia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) ] • Sexual Dysfunction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 5 % and at least twice the rate of placebo ) : nausea , somnolence , dry mouth , sweating , abnormal ejaculation , anorexia , constipation , impotence ( men ) , and libido decreased ( 6 . 1 ) .

6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tabletsfor the treatment of MDD and GAD is based on adequate and well controlled studies of venlafaxine extended - release capsules .
Below is a display of adverse reactions of venlafaxine extended - release capsules from those adequate and well - controlled studies in MDD , GAD , and other indications .
Most Common Adverse Reactions The most commonly observed adverse reactions in the clinical study database in venlafaxine extended - release capsules treated patients in MDD , GAD , and other indications ( incidence ≥ 5 % and at least twice the rate of placebo ) were : nausea ( 30 . 0 % ) , somnolence ( 15 . 3 % ) , dry mouth ( 14 . 8 % ) , sweating ( 11 . 4 % ) , abnormal ejaculation ( 9 . 9 % ) , anorexia ( 9 . 8 % ) , constipation ( 9 . 3 % ) , impotence ( 5 . 3 % ) and decreased libido ( 5 . 1 % ) .
Adverse Reactions Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation of Treatment Combined across short - term , placebo - controlled premarketing studies for MDD , GAD , and other indications , 12 % of the 3 , 558 patients who received venlafaxine extended - release capsules within a dosage range of 37 . 5 mg to 225 mg discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction , compared with 4 % of the 2 , 197 placebo - treated patients in those studies [ Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets are only available as 112 . 5 mg dosage strength ] .
The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in ≥ 1 % of the venlafaxine extended - release capsules treated patients in the short - term studies ( up to 12 weeks ) in MDD , GAD , and other indications are shown in Table 7 .

A dose - related increase in mean supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure was evident in patients treated with venlafaxine extended - release capsules .
Across all clinical studies in MDD , GAD , and other indications , 1 . 4 % of patients in the venlafaxine extended - release capsules groups experienced an increase in SDBP of ≥ 15 mm Hg along with a blood pressure ≥ 105 mm Hg , compared to 0 . 9 % of patients in the placebo groups .
Similarly , 1 % of patients in the venlafaxine extended - release capsules groups experienced an increase in SSBP of ≥ 20 mm Hg with a blood pressure ≥ 180 mm Hg , compared to 0 . 3 % of patients in the placebo groups .

Venlafaxine extended - release capsules treatment for up to 8 weeks and up to 6 months in premarketing placebo - controlled GAD trials was associated with mean final on - therapy increases in serum cholesterol concentration of approximately 1 . 0 mg / dL and 2 . 3 mg / dL , respectively while placebo subjects experienced mean final decreases of 4 . 9 mg / dL and 7 . 7 mg / dL , respectively .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of venlafaxine extended - release capsules .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .

Avoid concomitant use ( 7 . 1 ) .
7 . 1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets Table 13 : Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Venlafaxine Extended - Release TabletsMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ( MAOI ) Clinical Impact Concomitant use of SNRIs , including Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , with MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome .
Intervention Concomitant use of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs , including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 9 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Other Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact Concomitant use of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets with other serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome .
Intervention Monitor for symptoms of serotonin syndrome when Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets is used concomitantly with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems .
If serotonin syndrome occurs , consider discontinuation of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets and / or concomitant serotonergic drugs [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 8 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Alcohol Clinical Impact Based on an in vitro study , alcohol increases the release rate of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Avoid concomitant use of alcohol during treatment with Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets .
Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact Concomitant use of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets with an antiplatelet or anticoagulant drug may potentiate the risk of bleeding .
This may be due to the effect of venlafaxine on the release of serotonin by platelets .
Intervention Closely monitor patients receiving an antiplatelet or anticoagulant drug for bleeding when Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets is initiated or discontinued [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Concomitant use of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets with a CYP3A inhibitor increases the Cmax and AUC of venlafaxine and O - desmethylvenlafaxine ( ODV ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may increase the risk of toxicity of venlafaxine .
Intervention Consider reducing the dose of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets .
CYP2D6 Substrates Clinical Impact Concomitant use of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets with a CYP2D6 substrate increases Cmax and AUC of the CYP2D6 substrate , which may increase the risk of toxicity of the CYP2D6 substrate [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Consider reduction in dose of concomitant CYP2D6 substrates .
7 . 2 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Weight Loss Agents The safety and efficacy of venlafaxine therapy in combination with weight loss agents , including phentermine , have not been established .
Coadministration of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets and weight loss agents is not recommended .
Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets are not indicated for weight loss alone or in combination with other products .
Laboratory Test Interference False - positive urine immunoassay screening tests for phencyclidine ( PCP ) and amphetamine have been reported in patients taking venlafaxine .
This is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests .
False positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of venlafaxine therapy .
Confirmatory tests , such as gas chromatography / mass spectrometry , will distinguish venlafaxine from PCP and amphetamine .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Third trimester use may increase risk for symptoms of poor neonatal adaptation ( respiratory distress , temperature instability , feeding difficulty , hypotonia , tremor , irritability ) in the neonate ( 8 . 1 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants , including Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1 - 844 - 405 - 6185 or visiting online at https : / / womensmentalhealth . org / research / pregnancyregistry / antidepressants .
Risk Summary Available data from published epidemiologic studies on venlafaxine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse fetal outcomes ( see Data ) .
Available data from observational studies with venlafaxine have identified a potential increased risk for preeclampsia when used during mid to late pregnancy ; exposure to SNRIs near delivery may increase the risk for postpartum hemorrhage ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
There are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy and poor neonatal adaptation in newborns exposure to SNRIs , including Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
In animal studies , there was no evidence of malformations or fetotoxicity following administration of venlafaxine during organogenesis at doses up to 2 . 5 times ( rat ) or 4 times ( rabbit ) the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis .
Postnatal mortality and decreased pup weights were observed following venlafaxine administration to pregnant rats during gestation and lactation at 2 . 5 times ( mg / m2 ) the maximum human daily dose .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Women who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants .
This finding is from a prospective , longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy .
Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum .
Maternal Adverse Reactions Exposure to venlafaxine in mid to late pregnancy may increase the risk for preeclampsia , and exposure to SNRIs near delivery may increase the risk for postpartum hemorrhage .
Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions Neonates exposed to SNRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization , respiratory support , and tube feeding .
Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery .
Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress , cyanosis , apnea , seizures , temperature instability , feeding difficulty , vomiting , hypoglycemia , hypotonia , hypertonia , hyperreflexia , tremors , jitteriness , irritability , and constant crying .
These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SNRIs or possibly a drug discontinuation syndrome .
It should be noted that , in some cases , the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Monitor neonates who were exposed to Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets in the third trimester of pregnancy for drug discontinuation syndrome .
Data Human Data Published epidemiological studies of pregnant women exposed to venlafaxine have not established an increase of major birth defects , miscarriage , or other adverse developmental outcomes .
Methodological limitations may both fail to identify true findings and also identify findings that are not true .
Retrospective cohort studies based on claims data have shown an association between venlafaxine use and preeclampsia , compared to depressed women who did not take an antidepressant during pregnancy .
One study that assessed venlafaxine exposure in the second trimester or first half of the third trimester and preeclampsia showed an increased risk compared to unexposed depressed women ( adjusted ( adj ) RR 1 . 57 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 . 29 - 1 . 91 ) .
Preeclampsia was observed at venlafaxine doses equal to or greater than 75 mg per day and a duration of treatment > 30 days .
Another study that assessed venlafaxine exposure in gestational weeks 10 - 20 and preeclampsia showed an increased risk at doses equal to or greater than 150 mg per day .
Available data are limited by possible outcome misclassification and possible confounding due to depression severity and other confounders .
Retrospective cohort studies based on claims data have suggested an association between venlafaxine use near the time of delivery or through delivery and postpartum hemorrhage .
One study showed an increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage when venlafaxine exposure occurred through delivery , compared to unexposed depressed women ( adj RR 2 . 24 [ 95 % CI 1 . 69 - 2 . 97 ] ) .
There was no increased risk in women who were exposed to venlafaxine earlier in pregnancy .
Limitations of this study include possible confounding due to depression severity and other confounders .
Another study showed an increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage when SNRI exposure occurred for at least 15 days in the last month of pregnancy or through delivery , compared to unexposed women ( adj RR 1 . 64 - 1 . 76 ) .
The results of this study may be confounded by the effects of depression .
Animal Data Venlafaxine did not cause malformations in offspring of rats or rabbits given doses up to 2 . 5 times ( rat ) or 4 times ( rabbit ) the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis .
However , in rats , there was a decrease in pup weight , an increase in stillborn pups , and an increase in pup deaths during the first 5 days of lactation , when dosing began during pregnancy and continued until weaning .
The cause of these deaths is not known .
These effects occurred at 2 . 5 times ( mg / m2 ) the maximum human daily dose .
The no effect dose for rat pup mortality was 0 . 25 times the human dose on a mg / m2 basis .
When desvenlafaxine succinate , the major metabolite of venlafaxine , was administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 300 mg / kg / day and 75 mg / kg / day , respectively , no fetal malformations were observed .
These doses were associated with a plasma exposure ( AUC ) 19 times ( rats ) and 0 . 5 times ( rabbits ) the AUC exposure at an adult human dose of 100 mg per day .
However , fetal weights were decreased and skeletal ossification was delayed in rats in association with maternal toxicity at the highest dose , with an AUC exposure at the no - effect dose that is 4 . 5 - times the AUC exposure at an adult human dose of 100 mg per day .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from published literature report the presence of venlafaxine and its active metabolite in human milk and have not shown adverse reactions in breastfed infants ( see Data ) .
There are no data on the effects of venlafaxine on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data In a lactation study conducted in 11 breastfeeding women ( at a mean of 20 . 1 months post - partum ) who were taking a mean daily dose of 194 . 3 mg of venlafaxine and in a lactation study conducted in 6 breastfeeding women who were taking a daily dose of 225 mg to 300 mg of venlafaxine ( at a mean of 7 months post - partum ) , the estimated mean relative infant dose was 8 . 1 % and 6 . 4 % based on the sum of venlafaxine and its major metabolite , desvenlafaxine .
No adverse reactions were seen in the infants .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established .
Two placebo - controlled trials in 766 pediatric patients with MDD and two placebo - controlled trials in 793 pediatric patients with GAD have been conducted with venlafaxine extended - release capsules , and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients .
In the studies conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years , the occurrence of blood pressure and cholesterol increases was considered to be clinically relevant in pediatric patients and was similar to that observed in adult patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The following adverse reactions were also observed in pediatric patients : abdominal pain , agitation , dyspepsia , ecchymosis , epistaxis , and myalgia .
Although no studies have been designed to primarily assess Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablet ’ s impact on the growth , development , and maturation of children and adolescents , the studies that have been done suggest that venlafaxine extended - release capsules may adversely affect weight and height [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] .
Decreased appetite and weight loss were observed in placebo - controlled studies of pediatric patients 6 to 17 years [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 , 5 . 11 ) ] .
In pediatric clinical studies , the adverse reaction , suicidal ideation , was observed .
Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use The percentage of patients in clinical studies for venlafaxine extended - release capsules for MDD and GAD who were 65 years of age or older are shown in Table 14 .
Table 14 : Percentage ( and Number of Patients Studied ) of Patients 65 Years of Age and Older by Indication * Indication Venlafaxine Extended - Release Capsules * In addition , in the premarketing assessment of venlafaxine tablets , 12 % ( 357 / 2 , 897 ) of patients were ≥ 65 years of age .
MDD 4 ( 14 / 357 ) GAD 6 ( 77 / 1 , 381 ) No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients , and other reported clinical experience generally has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients .
However , greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
SSRIs and SNRIs , including Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients , who may be at greater risk for this adverse event [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine and ODV are not substantially altered in the elderly [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly on the basis of age alone , although other clinical circumstances , some of which may be more common in the elderly , such as renal or hepatic impairment , may warrant a dose reduction [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 , 2 . 7 ) ] .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Dosage reduction is recommended in patients with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) , moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) , and severe ( Child - Pugh Class C ) hepatic impairment or hepatic cirrhosis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment Dosage reduction is recommended in patients with mild ( CLcr = 60 - 89 mL / min ) or moderate ( CLcr = 30 - 59 mL / min ) renal impairment , and in patients undergoing hemodialysis or with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets contains venlafaxine which is not a controlled substance .
9 . 2 Abuse Abuse is the intentional , non - therapeutic use of a drug , even once , for its desirable psychological or physiological effects .
While venlafaxine has not been systematically studied in clinical studies for its potential for abuse , there was no indication of drug - seeking behavior in the clinical studies .
However , it is not possible to predict on the basis of premarketing experience the extent to which a CNS - active drug will be misused , diverted , and / or abused once marketed .
Consequently , providers should carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely , observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of venlafaxine ( e . g . , development of tolerance , incrementation of dose , drug - seeking behavior ) .
9 . 3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use , manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug .
In vitro studies revealed that venlafaxine has virtually no affinity for opiate , benzodiazepine , phencyclidine ( PCP ) , or N - methyl - D - aspartic acid ( NMDA ) receptors .
Venlafaxine was not found to have any significant CNS stimulant activity in rodents .
In primate drug discrimination studies , venlafaxine showed no significant stimulant or depressant abuse liability .
Discontinuation effects have been reported in patients receiving venlafaxine [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 8 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Human Experience During the premarketing evaluations of venlafaxine extended - release capsules and immediate - release venlafaxine tablets ( for MDD ) , there were twenty reports of acute overdosage with immediate - release venlafaxine tablets ( 6 and 14 reports in venlafaxine extended - release capsules and immediate - release venlafaxine tablets patients , respectively ) , either alone or in combination with other drugs and / or alcohol .
Somnolence was the most commonly reported symptom .
Among the other reported symptoms were paresthesia of all four limbs , moderate dizziness , nausea , numb hands and feet , and hot - cold spells 5 days after the overdose .
In most cases , no signs or symptoms were associated with overdose .
The majority of the reports involved ingestion in which the total dose of venlafaxine taken was estimated to be no more than several - fold higher than the usual therapeutic dose .
One patient who ingested 2 . 75 g of venlafaxine was observed to have two generalized convulsions and a prolongation of QTc to 500 msec , compared with 405 msec at baseline .
Mild sinus tachycardia was reported in two of the other patients .
Actions taken to treat the overdose included no treatment , hospitalization and symptomatic treatment , and hospitalization plus treatment with activated charcoal .
All patients recovered .
In postmarketing experience , overdose with venlafaxine has occurred predominantly in combination with alcohol and / or other drugs .
The most commonly reported events in overdosage include tachycardia , changes in level of consciousness ( ranging from somnolence to coma ) , mydriasis , seizures , and vomiting .
Electrocardiogram changes ( e . g . , prolongation of QT interval , bundle branch block , QRS prolongation ) , ventricular tachycardia , bradycardia , hypotension , rhabdomyolysis , vertigo , liver necrosis , serotonin syndrome , and death have been reported .
Published retrospective studies report that venlafaxine overdosage may be associated with an increased risk of fatal outcomes compared to that observed with SSRI antidepressant products , but lower than that for tricyclic antidepressants .
Epidemiological studies have shown that venlafaxine - treated patients have a higher preexisting burden of suicide risk factors than SSRI - treated patients .
The extent to which the finding of an increased risk of fatal outcomes can be attributed to the toxicity of venlafaxine in overdosage , as opposed to some characteristic ( s ) of venlafaxine - treated patients , is not clear .
Prescriptions for Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management , in order to reduce the risk of overdose .
Management of Overdosage No specific antidotes for Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets are known .
In managing overdosage , consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement .
Consider contacting a Poison Center ( 1 800 - 222 - 1222 ) or a medical toxicologist for overdosage management recommendations for Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of venlafaxine in treatment of MDD and GAD is unclear , but is thought to be related to the potentiation of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system , through inhibition of reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In - Vitro studies have demonstrated that venlafaxine and its active metabolite , O - desmethylvenlafaxine ( ODV ) , are potent and selective inhibitors of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and weak inhibitors of dopamine reuptake .
Venlafaxine and ODV have no significant affinity for muscarinic - cholinergic , H1 - histaminergic , or α1 - adrenergic receptors in vitro .
Pharmacologic activity at these receptors is hypothesized to be associated with the various anticholinergic , sedative , and cardiovascular effects seen with other psychotropic drugs .
Venlafaxine and ODV do not possess monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitory activity .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following single doses of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets under fed conditions , the dose - normalized geometric mean area under curve ( AUC ) of venlafaxine and ODV were 93 . 21 % and 93 . 14 % , respectively , and the dose - normalized geometric mean peak concentration ( Cmax ) of venlafaxine and ODV were 93 . 27 % and 106 . 3 % , respectively , compared to those following venlafaxine extended - release capsules under fed conditions .
Steady - state plasma concentrations of venlafaxine and ODV are attained within 3 days of oral multiple - dose therapy .
Absorption The absolute bioavailability of venlafaxine extended - release capsule is approximately 45 % .
Following a 112 . 5 mg Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets under fed conditions , the median time to attain Cmax ( Tmax ) was 10 hours ( range 5 - 18 hours ) for venlafaxine and 18 hours ( range 5 - 28 hours ) for ODV .
Effect of Food Ingestion of a high - fat meal with Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets increases mean AUC of venlafaxine and ODV by 18 % and 17 % , respectively ; increases mean Cmax of venlafaxine and ODV by 35 % and 22 % , respectively .
Median Tmax was altered by food ( median Tmax was 24 hours for both venlafaxine and ODV under fasted conditions ) .
Distribution At therapeutic concentrations , venlafaxine and ODV are minimally bound to plasma proteins ( 27 % and 30 % , respectively ) .
Administration of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein - bound should not cause increased free concentrations of the other drug .
Following a single 112 . 5 mg dose of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , the mean apparent volume of distribution ( Vz / F ) of venlafaxine is 1375 L . Elimination Following a single 112 . 5 mg dose of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets , the mean apparent clearance ( CL / F ) of venlafaxine is 170 L / hour and the mean elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of venlafaxine and ODV are 6 . 8 ± 1 . 6 hours and 11 . 3 ± 2 . 3 hours , respectively .
Metabolism Following absorption , venlafaxine undergoes extensive pre - systemic metabolism in the liver , primarily to ODV , but also to N - desmethylvenlafaxine , N , O - didesmethylvenlafaxine , and other minor metabolites .
In vitro studies indicate that the formation of ODV is catalyzed by CYP2D6 ; this has been confirmed in a clinical study showing that poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 had increased levels of venlafaxine and reduced levels of ODV compared to extensive metabolizers ( Figure 1 ) .
Excretion Approximately 87 % of a venlafaxine dose is recovered in the urine within 48 hours as unchanged venlafaxine ( 5 % ) , unconjugated ODV ( 29 % ) , conjugated ODV ( 26 % ) , or other minor inactive metabolites ( 27 % ) .
Renal elimination of venlafaxine and its metabolites is the primary route of excretion .
Specific Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients from two studies receiving immediate - release venlafaxine tablets involving both twice daily and three times daily regimens showed that dose - normalized trough plasma levels of either venlafaxine or ODV were unaltered by age or gender differences .
Exposures of venlafaxine and ODV in specific populations are summarized in Figure 1 .

Alcohol : An in vitro study showed significant increase of venlafaxine release from Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets at 6 hours with approximately 100 % of the drug release in the presence of 40 % and 20 % alcohol , respectively [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Effects of 5 % and 10 % alcohol on drug release were not significant compared to 0 % alcohol .
There is no in vivo study conducted for the effect of alcohol on drug exposure .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Tumors were not increased by venlafaxine treatment in mice or rats .
Venlafaxine was given by oral gavage to mice for 18 months at doses up to 120 mg / kg per day , which was 1 . 7 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis .
Venlafaxine was also given to rats by oral gavage for 24 months at doses up to 120 mg / kg per day .
In rats receiving the 120 mg / kg dose , plasma concentrations of venlafaxine at necropsy were 1 times ( male rats ) and 6 times ( female rats ) the plasma concentrations of patients receiving the maximum recommended human dose .
Plasma levels of the ODV were lower in rats than in patients receiving the maximum recommended dose .
ODV , the major human metabolite of venlafaxine , administered by oral gavage to mice and rats for 2 years did not increase the incidence of tumors in either study .
Mice received ODV at dosages up to 500 / 300 mg / kg / day ( dosage lowered after 45 weeks of dosing ) .
The exposure at the 300 mg / kg / day dose is 9 times that of a human dose of 225 mg / day .
Rats received ODV at dosages up to 300 mg / kg / day ( males ) or 500 mg / kg / day ( females ) .
The exposure at the highest dose is approximately 8 ( males ) or 11 ( females ) times that of a human dose of 225 mg / day .
Mutagenesis Venlafaxine and the major human metabolite , ODV , were not mutagenic in the Ames reverse mutation assay in Salmonella bacteria or the Chinese hamster ovary / HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay .
Venlafaxine was also not mutagenic or clastogenic in the in vitro BALB / c - 3T3 mouse cell transformation assay , the sister chromatid exchange assay in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells , or in the in vivo chromosomal aberration assay in rat bone marrow .
ODV was not clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay or in the in vivo chromosomal aberration assay in rats .
Impairment of Fertility Reproduction and fertility studies of venlafaxine in rats showed no adverse effects of venlafaxine on male or female fertility at oral doses of up to 2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 225 mg / day on a mg / m2 basis .
However , when desvenlafaxine succinate , the major human metabolite of venlafaxine , was administered orally to male and female rats , fertility was reduced at the high dose of 300 mg / kg / day , which is 10 ( males ) and 19 ( females ) times the AUC exposure at an adult human dose of 100 mg per day .
There was no effect on fertility at 100 mg / kg / day , which is 3 ( males ) or 5 ( females ) times the AUC exposure at an adult human dose of 100 mg per day .
These studies did not address reversibility of the effect on fertility .
The relevance of these findings to humans is not known .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Major Depressive Disorder The efficacy of Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets for the treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD ) in adult patients is based upon adequate and well - controlled studies of venlafaxine extended - release capsules .
The results of these adequate and well - controlled studies of venlafaxine extended - release capsules are presented below .
The efficacy of venlafaxine extended - release capsules as a treatment for Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) was established in two placebo - controlled , short - term ( 8 weeks for study 1 ; 12 weeks for study 2 ) , flexible - dose studies , with doses starting at 75 mg per day and ranging to 225 mg per day in adult outpatients meeting DSM - III - R or DSM - IV criteria for MDD [ Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets are only available in 112 . 5 mg dosage strength ] .
In moderately depressed outpatients , the initial dose of venlafaxine was 75 mg per day .
In both studies , venlafaxine extended - release capsules demonstrated superiority over placebo on the primary efficacy measure defined as change from baseline in the HAM - D - 21 total score to the endpoint visit .
Venlafaxine extended - release capsules also demonstrated superiority over placebo on the key secondary efficacy endpoint , the Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) Severity of Illness scale .
Examination of gender subsets of the population studied did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender .
In a longer - term study , adult outpatients with MDD who had responded during an 8 - week open - label study on venlafaxine extended - release capsules 75 mg , 150 mg , or 225 mg , once daily every morning were randomized to continuation of their same venlafaxine extended - release capsules dose or to placebo , for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse .
Response during the open - label phase was defined as a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≤ 3 and a HAM - D - 21 total score of ≤ 10 at the day 56 evaluation .
Relapse during the double - blind phase was defined as follows : ( 1 ) a reappearance of major depressive disorder as defined by DSM - IV criteria and a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥ 4 ( moderately ill ) , ( 2 ) 2 consecutive CGI Severity of Illness item scores of ≥ 4 , or ( 3 ) a final CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥ 4 for any patient who withdrew from the study for any reason .
Patients receiving continued venlafaxine extended - release capsules treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 26 weeks compared with those receiving placebo .

The results of these adequate and well - controlled studies of venlafaxine extended - release capsules are presented below .
The efficacy of venlafaxine extended - release capsules as a treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) was established in two 8 - week , placebo - controlled , fixed - dose studies of 75 mg to 225 mg per day , one 6 - month , placebo - controlled , flexible - dose study of 75 mg to 225 mg per day ) , and one 6 - month , placebo - controlled , fixed - dose study of 37 . 5 mg , 75 mg , and 150 mg per day in adult outpatients meeting DSM - IV criteria for GAD [ Venlafaxine Extended - Release Tablets are only available in 112 . 5 mg dosage strength ] .
In one 8 - week study , venlafaxine extended - release capsules demonstrated superiority over placebo for the 75 mg , 150 mg , and 225 mg per day doses as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety ( HAM - A ) total score , both the HAM - A anxiety and tension items , and the Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) scale .
However , the 75 mg and 150 mg per day doses were not as consistently effective as the highest dose ( Study 1 ) .
A second 8 - week study evaluating doses of 75 mg and 150 mg per day and placebo showed that both doses were more effective than placebo on some of these same outcomes ; however , the 75 mg per day dose was more consistently effective than the 150 mg per day dose ( Study 2 ) .
A dose - response relationship for effectiveness in GAD was not clearly established in the 75 mg to 225 mg per day dose range studied .
Two 6 - month studies , one evaluating venlafaxine extended - release capsules doses of 37 . 5 mg , 75 mg , and 150 mg per day ( study 3 ) and the other evaluating venlafaxine extended - release capsules doses of 75 mg to 225 mg per day ( study 4 ) , showed that daily doses of 75 mg or higher were more effective than placebo on the HAM - A total , both the HAM - A anxiety and tension items , and the CGI scale during 6 months of treatment .
While there was also evidence for superiority over placebo for the 37 . 5 mg per day dose , this dose was not as consistently effective as the higher doses .
Examination of gender subsets of the population studied did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender .
