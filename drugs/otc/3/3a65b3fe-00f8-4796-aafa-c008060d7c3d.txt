[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Brompheniramine maleate is a histamine antagonist , specifically an H 1 - receptor - blocking agent belonging to the alkylamine class of antihistamines .
Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for receptor sites on effector cells .
Brompheniramine also has anticholinergic ( drying ) and sedative effects .
Among the antihistaminic effects , it antagonizes the allergic response ( vasodilation , increased vascular permeability , increased mucus secretion ) of nasal tissue .
Brompheniramine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract , with peak plasma concentration after single , oral dose of 4 mg reached in 5 hours ; urinary excretion is the major route of elimination , mostly as products of biodegradation ; the liver is assumed to be the main site of metabolic transformation .
Pseudoephedrine acts on sympathetic nerve endings and also on smooth muscle , making it useful as a nasal decongestant .
The nasal decongestant effect is mediated by the action of pseudoephedrine on α - sympathetic receptors , producing vasoconstriction of the dilated nasal arterioles .
Following oral administration , effects are noted within 30 minutes with peak activity occurring at approximately one hour .
Dextromethorphan acts centrally to elevate the threshold for coughing .
It has no analgesic or addictive properties .
The onset of antitussive action occurs in 15 to 30 minutes after administration and is of long duration .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Brompheniramine Maleate , Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride , and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide Syrup is indicated for relief of coughs and upper respiratory symptoms , including nasal congestion , associated with allergy or the common cold .

Do not use dextromethorphan in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) ( see Drug Interactions ) .
Antihistamines should not be used to treat lower respiratory tract conditions including asthma .
WARNINGS Especially in infants and small children , antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations , convulsions , and death .
Antihistamines may diminish mental alertness .
In the young child , they may produce excitation .
PRECAUTIONS General : Because of its antihistamine component , Brompheniramine Maleate , Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride , and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide Syrup should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma , narrow angle glaucoma , gastrointestinal obstruction , or urinary bladder neck obstruction .

Information for Patients : Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness , such as driving a car or operating dangerous machinery .
Drug Interactions : Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) Hyperpyrexia , hypotension , and death have been reported coincident with the coadministration of MAOIs and products containing dextromethorphan .
In addition , MAOIs prolong and intensify the anticholinergic ( drying ) effects of antihistamines and may enhance the effect of pseudoephedrine .
Concomitant administration of Brompheniramine Maleate , Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride , and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide Syrup and MAOIs should be avoided ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Central nervous system ( CNS ) depressants Antihistamines have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants ( hypnotics , sedatives , tranquilizers , antianxiety agents , etc . ) .
Antihypertensive drugs Sympathomimetic may reduce the effects of antihypertensive drugs .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Animal studies of Brompheniramine Maleate , Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride , and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide Syrup to assess the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or the effect on fertility have not been performed .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects - Pregnancy Category C : Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Brompheniramine Maleate , Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride , and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide Syrup .
It is also not known whether Brompheniramine Maleate , Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride , and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide Syrup can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
It should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Reproduction studies of brompheniramine maleate ( a component of Brompheniramine Maleate , Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride , and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide Syrup ) in rats and mice at doses up to 16 times the maximum human doses have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers : Because of the higher risk of intolerance of antihistamines in small infants generally , and in newborns and prematures in particular , Brompheniramine Maleate , Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride , and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide Syrup is contraindicated in nursing mothers .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .

OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms : Central nervous system effects from overdosage of brompheniramine may vary from depression to stimulation , especially in children .
Anticholinergic effects may be noted .
Toxic doses of pseudoephedrine may result in CNS stimulation , tachycardia , hypertension , and cardiac arrhythmias ; signs of CNS depression may occasionally be seen .
Dextromethorphan in toxic doses will cause drowsiness , ataxia , nystagmus , opisthotonos , and convulsive seizures .
Toxic Doses : Data suggest that individuals may respond in an unexpected manner to apparently small amounts of a particular drug .
A 2 ½ - year - old child survived the ingestion of 21 mg / kg of dextromethorphan exhibiting only ataxia , drowsiness , and fever , but seizures have been reported in 2 children following the ingestion of 13 – 17 mg / kg .
Another 2 ½ - year - old child survived a dose of 300 – 900 mg of brompheniramine .
The toxic dose of pseudoephedrine should be less than that of ephedrine , which is estimated to be 50 mg / kg .
Treatment : Induce emesis if patient is alert and is seen prior to 6 hours following ingestion .
Precautions against aspiration must be taken , especially in infants and small children .
Gastric lavage may be carried out , although in some instances tracheostomy may be necessary prior to lavage .
Naloxone hydrochloride 0 . 005 mg / kg intravenously may be of value in reversing the CNS depression that may occur from an overdose of dextromethorphan .
CNS stimulants may counter CNS depression .
Should CNS hyperactivity or convulsive seizures occur , intravenous short - acting barbiturates may be indicated .
Hypertensive responses and / or tachycardia should be treated appropriately .
Oxygen , intravenous fluids , and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated .
