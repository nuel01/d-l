[ Enter Active Ingredient here ] [ Enter Inactive Ingredients here ] ACTIONS This product combines the expectorant , guaifenesin , with the cough suppressant , codeine .
Guaifenesin enhances the output of lower respiratory tract fluid .
The enhanced flow of less viscid secretions promotes and facilitates the removal of mucus .
Codeine is a centrally acting agent which elevates the threshold for cough .
As a result , dry , unproductive coughs become more productive and less frequent .
