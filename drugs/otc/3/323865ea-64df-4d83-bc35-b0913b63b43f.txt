No artificial colorants .
No dairy , wheat , sugar or egg INDICATIONS & USAGE BioparTM delta - FORTE is specifically indicated as a primary and adjunctive treatment in pernicious anemia patients having idiosyncrasy or sensitivity to parenteral administration - or when parental therapy is refused ; MECHANISM OF ACTION COBALAMIN [ TREATMENT ] ; FOLATE [ PREVENTION ] ; INTRINSIC FACTOR [ B12 - ADJUVENT ] - Cobalamin is essential for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine - a reaction which also requires folate .
In the absence of cobalamin - ie , cobalamin deficiency , tetrahydrofolate cannot be regenerated from l - methylfolic acid , and a functional folate deficiency occurs - ie , “ methyl trap hypothesis ” .
Gastrointestinal absorption of cobalamin depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor , and lack of intrinisic factor results in cobalamin deficiency .
DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION The adult dose is one capsule daily preferably on an empty stomach .
A deficiency of cobalamin may present first as folate deficiency - which is why folate supplementation may mask the symptoms that would normally result and also why advanced folate supplementation requires licensed medical supervision ; because of this , reticulocyte plasma count , cobalamin and folate must be obtained prior to treatment .
Requirements of cobalamin and / or folate in excess of normal ( due to pregnancy , thyrotoxicosis , hemolytic anemia , hemorrhage , malignancy , hepatic and renal disease ) can usually be met with oral supplementation .
As a general rule - in Pernicious Anemia patients , treatment will be required for the remainder of the patient ’ s life , and usually requires weekly or monthly injections at the doctor ' s office .
Patients that are non - compliant with parenteral therapy ( injections ) may use this product as a substitute ONLY UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Mild transient diarrhea , polycythemia vera , itching , transitory exanthema , feeling of swelling of entire body may occur with administration of cobalamin .
Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folate .
Sensitivity to porcine intrinsic factor derived from liver substance has been reported in patients , and may occur at any time ; BioparTMdelta - FORTE contains a non - inhibitory form of intrinsic factor that is not derived from liver substance but rather just the mucosa ( stomach substance ) - in which such senstitivity is less likely to occur , however caution is advised and continuous monitoring under licensed medical supervision is required .
WARNING USE OF THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT DIRECT SUPERVISION OF A PHYSICIAN IS DANGEROUS ; Some patients afflicted with pernicious anemia may or not respond to the orally ingested vitamin B12 , and there is no known way to predict which patients may respond and which patients may cease to respond ; Periodic examinations and laboratory studies of pernicious anemia patients are essential and recommended ; and - The parenteral administration of ( cyano ) cobalamin - or vitamin B12 , is generally recognized as a fully effective treatment of pernicious anemia .
Parenteral alkyl - cobalamin preparations have not been and are not authorized for use except by or on the prescription of a physician .
PRECAUTIONS GENERAL : 0 . 1 mg or more of folic acid daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that the hematological remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive .
The safe tolerable limit for folic acid ( in preparations ) is 1 mg [ emphasis added ] ; Folic acid is not a substitute for vitamin B12 - although it may improve vitamin B12 - deficient anemias .
Exclusive use of folic acid in treating vitamin B12 - deficient anemias could result in progressive and irreversible neurologic damage .
Specifically , vitamin B12 deficiency allowed to progress over 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord - as observed when folate therapy is used as the only hematopoietic agent ; Doses of vitamin B12 exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency .
Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis ; and - A dietary deficiency of only vitamin B12 is rare ; multiple vitamin deficiency is expected in any dietary deficiency .
No single regimen fits all cases , and the status of the patient observed in follow - up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy .
DRUG INTERACTIONS : Colchicine , para - aminosalicylic acid , and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of cobalamin .
Epileptic , antineoplastic and Parkinson ' s medications are cautioned in the concimant use with folate supplementation .
HOW SUPPLIED BioparTM delta - FORTE is supplied as oval , annatto ( ” orangish - brown ” ) softgels * with imprint " 7N3 " .

REGULATORY BioparTM delta - FORTE is regulated as a drug to ensure it ' s use is under medical supervision , and because of this , advanced folate supplementation is possible [ 21 CFR 250 . 201 ] .
Intrinsic Factor was first marketed as Extralin ( R ) in 1932 , and Extralin - B ( R ) with B - vitamins in 1936 , followed by the Becotin ( R ) product which contained all the equivalent vitamins as this product plus intrinsic factor .
" Old " drugs , including virtamins , which were considered safe prior to 1938 , were permitted to continue on the market without further review .
However , FDA maintained the authority to review these old drugs if possible safety concerns became apparent .
In 1951 , the Durham - Humphrey Act was passed .
This act formally differentiated between prescription and OTC drugs .
