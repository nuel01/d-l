Discontinue VEGZELMA in patients who develop necrotizing fasciitis .
5 . 3 Hemorrhage Bevacizumab products can result in two distinct patterns of bleeding : minor hemorrhage , which is most commonly Grade 1 epistaxis , and serious hemorrhage , which in some cases has been fatal .
Severe or fatal hemorrhage , including hemoptysis , gastrointestinal bleeding , hematemesis , CNS hemorrhage , epistaxis , and vaginal bleeding occurred up to 5 - fold more frequently in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone .
Across clinical studies , the incidence of Grades 3 – 5 hemorrhagic events ranged from 0 . 4 % to 7 % in patients receiving bevacizumab [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Serious or fatal pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 31 % of patients with squamous NSCLC and 4 % of patients with non - squamous NSCLC receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to none of the patients receiving chemotherapy alone .
Do not administer VEGZELMA to patients with recent history of hemoptysis of 1 / 2 teaspoon or more of red blood .
Discontinue in patients who develop a Grades 3 – 4 hemorrhage .
5 . 4 Arterial Thromboembolic Events Serious , sometimes fatal , arterial thromboembolic events ( ATE ) including cerebral infarction , transient ischemic attacks , myocardial infarction , and angina , occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to patients receiving chemotherapy .
Across clinical studies , the incidence of Grades 3 – 5 ATE was 5 % in patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to ≤ 2 % in patients receiving chemotherapy alone ; the highest incidence occurred in patients with GBM .
The risk of developing ATE was increased in patients with a history of arterial thromboembolism , diabetes , or > 65 years [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .

Discontinue in patients who develop hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy .
5 . 7 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) was reported in < 0 . 5 % of patients across clinical studies .
The onset of symptoms occurred from 16 hours to 1 year after the first dose .
PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache , seizure , lethargy , confusion , blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances .
Mild to severe hypertension may be present .
Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES . Discontinue VEGZELMA in patients who develop PRES . Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days after discontinuing bevacizumab products , although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae .
The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab products in patients who developed PRES is not known .
5 . 8 Renal Injury and Proteinuria The incidence and severity of proteinuria was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab products as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy .
Grade 3 ( defined as urine dipstick 4 + or > 3 . 5 grams of protein per 24 hours ) to Grade 4 ( defined as nephrotic syndrome ) ranged from 0 . 7 % to 7 % in clinical studies .
The overall incidence of proteinuria ( all grades ) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705 , in which the incidence was 20 % .
Median onset of proteinuria was 5 . 6 months ( 15 days to 37 months ) after initiating bevacizumab .
Median time to resolution was 6 . 1 months ( 95 % CI : 2 . 8 , 11 . 3 ) .
Proteinuria did not resolve in 40 % of patients after median follow - up of 11 . 2 months and required discontinuation of bevacizumab in 30 % of the patients who developed proteinuria [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In an exploratory , pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies , 5 % of patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2 – 4 ( defined as urine dipstick 2 + or greater or > 1 gram of protein per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome ) proteinuria .
Grades 2 – 4 proteinuria resolved in 74 % of patients .
Bevacizumab was reinitiated in 42 % of patients .
Of the 113 patients who reinitiated bevacizumab , 48 % experienced a second episode of Grades 2 – 4 proteinuria .
Nephrotic syndrome occurred in < 1 % of patients receiving bevacizumab across clinical studies , in some instances with fatal outcome .
In a published case series , kidney biopsy of 6 patients with proteinuria showed findings consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy .
Results of a retrospective analysis of 5805 patients who received bevacizumab with chemotherapy and 3713 patients who received chemotherapy alone , showed higher rates of elevated serum creatinine levels ( between 1 . 5 to 1 . 9 times baseline levels ) in patients who received bevacizumab .
Serum creatinine levels did not return to baseline in approximately one - third of patients who received bevacizumab .
Monitor proteinuria by dipstick urine analysis for the development or worsening of proteinuria with serial urinalyses during VEGZELMA therapy .
Patients with a 2 + or greater urine dipstick reading should undergo further assessment with a 24 - hour urine collection .
Withhold for proteinuria greater than or equal to 2 grams per 24 hours and resume when less than 2 grams per 24 hours .
Discontinue in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome .
Data from a postmarketing safety study showed poor correlation between UPCR ( Urine Protein / Creatinine Ratio ) and 24 - hour urine protein [ Pearson Correlation 0 . 39 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 17 , 0 . 57 ) ] .
5 . 9 Infusion - Related Reactions Infusion - related reactions reported across clinical studies and postmarketing experience include hypertension , hypertensive crises associated with neurologic signs and symptoms , wheezing , oxygen desaturation , Grade 3 hypersensitivity , anaphylatoid / anaphylactic reacionts , chest pain , headaches , rigors , and diaphoresis .
In clinical studies , infusion - related reactions with the first dose occurred in < 3 % of patients and severe reactions occurred in 0 . 4 % of patients .
Decrease the rate of infusion for mild , clinically insignificant infusion - related reactions .
Interrupt the infusion in patients with clinically significant infusion - related reactions and consider resuming at a slower rate following resolution .
Discontinue in patients who develop a severe infusion - related reaction and administer appropriate medical therapy ( e . g . , epinephrine , corticosteroids , intravenous antihistamines , bronchodilators and / or oxygen ) .
5 . 10 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies , bevacizumab products may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
Congenital malformations were observed with the administration of bevacizumab to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis every 3 days at a dose as low as a clinical dose of 10 mg / kg .
Furthermore , animal models link angiogenesis and VEGF and VEGFR2 to critical aspects of female reproduction , embryo - fetal development , and postnatal development .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VEGZELMA and for 6 months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 11 Ovarian Failure The incidence of ovarian failure was 34 % vs . 2 % in premenopausal women receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy as compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone for adjuvant treatment of a solid tumor .
After discontinuing bevacizumab , recovery of ovarian function at all time points during the post - treatment period was demonstrated in 22 % of women receiving bevacizumab .
Recovery of ovarian function is defined as resumption of menses , a positive serum β - HCG pregnancy test , or an FSH level < 30 mIU / mL during the post - treatment period .
Long - term effects of bevacizumab products on fertility are unknown .
Inform females of reproductive potential of the risk of ovarian failure prior to initiating VEGZELMA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 12 Congestive Heart Failure ( CHF ) VEGZELMA is not indicated for use with anthracycline - based chemotherapy .
The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 left ventricular dysfunction was 1 % in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to 0 . 6 % of patients receiving chemotherapy alone .
Among patients who received prior anthracycline treatment , the rate of CHF was 4 % for patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy as compared to 0 . 6 % for patients receiving chemotherapy alone .
In previously untreated patients with a hematological malignancy , the incidence of CHF and decline in left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) were increased in patients receiving bevacizumab with anthracycline - based chemotherapy compared to patients receiving placebo with the same chemotherapy regimen .
The proportion of patients with a decline in LVEF from baseline of ≥ 20 % or a decline from baseline of 10 % to < 50 % , was 10 % in patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to 5 % in patients receiving chemotherapy alone .
Time to onset of left - ventricular dysfunction or CHF was 1 to 6 months after the first dose in at least 85 % of the patients and was resolved in 62 % of the patients who developed CHF in the bevacizumab arm compared to 82 % in the placebo arm .
Discontinue VEGZELMA in patients who develop CHF .

Selected Grades 3 – 5 non - hematologic and Grades 4 – 5 hematologic occurring at a higher incidence ( ≥ 2 % ) in patients receiving bevacizumab with FOLFOX4 compared to FOLFOX4 alone were fatigue ( 19 % vs . 13 % ) , diarrhea ( 18 % vs . 13 % ) , sensory neuropathy ( 17 % vs . 9 % ) , nausea ( 12 % vs . 5 % ) , vomiting ( 11 % vs . 4 % ) , dehydration ( 10 % vs . 5 % ) , hypertension ( 9 % vs . 2 % ) , abdominal pain ( 8 % vs . 5 % ) , hemorrhage ( 5 % vs . 1 % ) , other neurological ( 5 % vs . 3 % ) , ileus ( 4 % vs . 1 % ) and headache ( 3 % vs . 0 % ) .
These data are likely to under - estimate the true adverse reaction rates due to the reporting mechanisms .
First - Line Non Squamous Non - Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated as first - line treatment in 422 patients with unresectable NSCLC who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in an active - controlled , open - label , multicenter trial ( E4599 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Chemotherapy naïve patients with locally advanced , metastatic or recurrent non – squamous NSCLC were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive six 21 - day cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without bevacizumab ( 15 mg / kg every 3 weeks ) .
After completion or upon discontinuation of chemotherapy , patients randomized to receive bevacizumab continued to receive bevacizumab alone until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity .
The trial excluded patients with predominant squamous histology ( mixed cell type tumors only ) , CNS metastasis , gross hemoptysis ( 1 / 2 teaspoon or more of red blood ) , unstable angina , or receiving therapeutic anticoagulation .
The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population .
Only Grades 3 – 5 non - hematologic and Grades 4 – 5 hematologic adverse reactions were collected .
Grades 3 – 5 non - hematologic and Grades 4 – 5 hematologic adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence ( ≥ 2 % ) in patients receiving bevacizumab with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone were neutropenia ( 27 % vs . 17 % ) , fatigue ( 16 % vs . 13 % ) , hypertension ( 8 % vs . 0 . 7 % ) , infection without neutropenia ( 7 % vs . 3 % ) , venous thromboembolism ( 5 % vs . 3 % ) , febrile neutropenia ( 5 % vs . 2 % ) , pneumonitis / pulmonary infiltrates ( 5 % vs . 3 % ) , infection with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia ( 4 % vs . 2 % ) , hyponatremia ( 4 % vs . 1 % ) , headache ( 3 % vs . 1 % ) and proteinuria ( 3 % vs . 0 % ) .
Recurrent Glioblastoma The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in a multicenter , randomized , open - label study ( EORTC 26101 ) in patients with recurrent GBM following radiotherapy and temozolomide of whom 278 patients received at least one dose of bevacizumab and are considered safety evaluable [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
Patients were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to receive bevacizumab ( 10 mg / kg every 2 weeks ) with lomustine or lomustine alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population .
In the bevacizumab with lomustine arm , 22 % of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 10 % of patients in the lomustine arm .
In patients receiving bevacizumab with lomustine , the adverse reaction profile was similar to that observed in other approved indications .

Patients who had undergone a nephrectomy were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive either bevacizumab ( 10 mg / kg every 2 weeks ) or placebo with interferon alfa [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population .
Grades 3 – 5 adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence ( > 2 % ) were fatigue ( 13 % vs . 8 % ) , asthenia ( 10 % vs . 7 % ) , proteinuria ( 7 % vs . 0 % ) , hypertension ( 6 % vs . 1 % ; including hypertension and hypertensive crisis ) , and hemorrhage ( 3 % vs . 0 . 3 % ; including epistaxis , small intestinal hemorrhage , aneurysm ruptured , gastric ulcer hemorrhage , gingival bleeding , hemoptysis , hemorrhage intracranial , large intestinal hemorrhage , respiratory tract hemorrhage , and traumatic hematoma ) .

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other bevacizumab products may be misleading .
In clinical studies for adjuvant treatment of a solid tumor , 0 . 6 % ( 14 / 2233 ) of patients tested positive for treatment - emergent anti - bevacizumab antibodies as detected by an electrochemiluminescent ( ECL ) based assay .
Among these 14 patients , three tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against bevacizumab using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
The clinical significance of these anti - bevacizumab antibodies is not known .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of bevacizumab .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
General : Polyserositis Cardiovascular : Pulmonary hypertension , Mesenteric venous occlusion Gastrointestinal : Gastrointestinal ulcer , Intestinal necrosis , Anastomotic ulceration Hemic and lymphatic : Pancytopenia Hepatobiliary disorders : Gallbladder perforation Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : Osteonecrosis of the jaw Renal : Renal thrombotic microangiopathy ( manifested as severe proteinuria ) Respiratory : Nasal septum perforation Vascular : Arterial ( including aortic ) aneurysms , dissections , and rupture 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Effects of VEGZELMA on Other Drugs No clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan or its active metabolite SN38 , interferon alfa , carboplatin or paclitaxel was observed when bevacizumab was administered in combination with these drugs ; however , 3 of the 8 patients receiving bevacizumab with paclitaxel and carboplatin had lower paclitaxel exposure after four cycles of treatment ( at Day 63 ) than those at Day 0 , while patients receiving paclitaxel and carboplatin alone had a greater paclitaxel exposure at Day 63 than at Day 0 .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and their mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , bevacizumab products may cause fetal harm in pregnant women .
Limited postmarketing reports describe cases of fetal malformations with use of bevacizumab products in pregnancy ; however , these reports are insufficient to determine drug - associated risks .
In animal reproduction studies , intravenous administration of bevacizumab to pregnant rabbits every 3 days during organogenesis at doses approximately 1 to 10 times the clinical dose of 10 mg / kg produced fetal resorptions , decreased maternal and fetal weight gain and multiple congenital malformations including corneal opacities and abnormal ossification of the skull and skeleton including limb and phalangeal defects ( see Data ) .
Furthermore , animal models link angiogenesis and VEGF and VEGFR2 to critical aspects of female reproduction , embryofetal development , and postnatal development .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Pregnant rabbits dosed with 10 mg / kg to 100 mg / kg bevacizumab ( approximately 1 to 10 times the clinical dose of 10 mg / kg ) every three days during the period of organogenesis ( gestation day 6 – 18 ) exhibited decreases in maternal and fetal body weights and increased number of fetal resorptions .
There were dose - related increases in the number of litters containing fetuses with any type of malformation ( 42 % for the 0 mg / kg dose , 76 % for the 30 mg / kg dose , and 95 % for the 100 mg / kg dose ) or fetal alterations ( 9 % for the 0 mg / kg dose , 15 % for the 30 mg / kg dose , and 61 % for the 100 mg / kg dose ) .
Skeletal deformities were observed at all dose levels , with some abnormalities including meningocele observed only at the 100 mg / kg dose level .
Teratogenic effects included : reduced or irregular ossification in the skull , jaw , spine , ribs , tibia and bones of the paws ; fontanel , rib and hindlimb deformities ; corneal opacity ; and absent hindlimb phalanges .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of bevacizumab products in human milk , the effects on the breast fed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Human IgG is present in human milk , but published data suggest that breast milk antibodies do not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with VEGZELMA and for 6 months after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females Bevacizumab products may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VEGZELMA and for 6 months after the last dose .
Infertility Females Bevacizumab products increase the risk of ovarian failure and may impair fertility .
Inform females of reproductive potential of the risk of ovarian failure prior to the first - dose of VEGZELMA .
Long - term effects of bevacizumab products on fertility are not known .
In a clinical study of 179 premenopausal women randomized to receive chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab , the incidence of ovarian failure was higher in patients who received bevacizumab with chemotherapy ( 34 % ) compared to patients who received chemotherapy alone ( 2 % ) .
After discontinuing bevacizumab with chemotherapy , recovery of ovarian function occurred in 22 % of these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of bevacizumab products in pediatric patients have not been established .
In published literature reports , cases of non - mandibular osteonecrosis have been observed in patients under the age of 18 years who received bevacizumab .
Bevacizumab products are not approved for use in patients under the age of 18 years .
Antitumor activity was not observed among eight pediatric patients with relapsed GBM who received bevacizumab and irinotecan .
Addition of bevacizumab to standard of care did not result in improved event - free survival in pediatric patients enrolled in two randomized clinical studies , one in high grade glioma ( n = 121 ) and one in metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma or non - rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma ( n = 154 ) .
Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data from 152 pediatric and young adult patients with cancer ( 7 months to 21 years of age ) , bevacizumab clearance normalized by body weight in pediatrics was comparable to that in adults .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Juvenile cynomolgus monkeys with open growth plates exhibited physeal dysplasia following 4 to 26 weeks exposure at 0 . 4 to 20 times the recommended human dose ( based on mg / kg and exposure ) .
The incidence and severity of physeal dysplasia were dose - related and were partially reversible upon cessation of treatment .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In an exploratory , pooled analysis of 1745 patients from five randomized , controlled studies , 35 % of patients were ≥ 65 years old .
The overall incidence of ATE was increased in all patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy as compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone , regardless of age ; however , the increase in the incidence of ATE was greater in patients ≥ 65 years ( 8 % vs . 3 % ) as compared to patients < 65 years ( 2 % vs . 1 % ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Bevacizumab - adcd is a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor .
Bevacizumab - adcd is a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that contains human framework regions and murine complementarity - determining regions .
Bevacizumab - adcd has an approximate molecular weight of 149 kDa .
Bevacizumab - adcd is produced in a mammalian cell ( Chinese Hamster Ovary ) expression system .
VEGZELMA ( bevacizumab - adcd ) injection is a sterile , preservative - free , clear to opalescent , colorless to pale brown solution in a single - dose vial for intravenous use .
VEGZELMA contains bevacizumab - adcd at a concentration of 25 mg / mL in either 100 mg / 4 mL or 400 mg / 16 mL single - dose vials .
Each mL of solution contains 25 mg bevacizumab - adcd , dibasic sodium phosphate ( 1 . 2 mg ) , monobasic sodium phosphate ( 5 mg ) , polysorbate 20 ( 0 . 4 mg ) , trehalose ( 54 . 3 mg ) , and Water for Injection , USP .
The pH is 6 . 2 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Bevacizumab products bind VEGF and prevent the interaction of VEGF to its receptors ( Flt - 1 and KDR ) on the surface of endothelial cells .
The interaction of VEGF with its receptors leads to endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation in in vitro models of angiogenesis .
Administration of bevacizumab to xenotransplant models of colon cancer in nude ( athymic ) mice caused reduction of microvascular growth and inhibition of metastatic disease progression .
12 . 2 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic profile of bevacizumab was assessed using an assay that measures total serum bevacizumab concentrations ( i . e . , the assay did not distinguish between free bevacizumab and bevacizumab bound to VEGF ligand ) .
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 491 patients who received 1 to 20 mg / kg of bevacizumab every week , every 2 weeks , or every 3 weeks , bevacizumab pharmacokinetics are linear and the predicted time to reach more than 90 % of steady state concentration is 84 days .
The accumulation ratio following a dose of 10 mg / kg of bevacizumab once every 2 weeks is 2 . 8 .
Population simulations of bevacizumab exposures provide a median trough concentration of 80 . 3 mcg / mL on Day 84 ( 10 th , 90 th percentile : 45 , 128 ) following a dose of 5 mg / kg once every two weeks .
Distribution The mean ( % coefficient of variation [ CV % ] ) central volume of distribution is 2 . 9 ( 22 % ) L . Elimination The mean ( CV % ) clearance is 0 . 23 ( 33 ) L / day .
The estimated half - life is 20 days ( 11 to 50 days ) .
Specific Populations The clearance of bevacizumab varied by body weight , sex , and tumor burden .
After correcting for body weight , males had a higher bevacizumab clearance ( 0 . 26 L / day vs . 0 . 21 L / day ) and a larger central volume of distribution ( 3 . 2 L vs . 2 . 7 L ) than females .
Patients with higher tumor burden ( at or above median value of tumor surface area ) had a higher bevacizumab clearance ( 0 . 25 L / day vs . 0 . 20 L / day ) than patients with tumor burdens below the median .
In Study AVF2107g , there was no evidence of lesser efficacy ( hazard ratio for overall survival ) in males or patients with higher tumor burden treated with bevacizumab as compared to females and patients with low tumor burden .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted to assess potential of bevacizumab products for carcinogenicity or mutagenicity .
Bevacizumab products may impair fertility .
Female cynomolgus monkeys treated with 0 . 4 to 20 times the recommended human dose of bevacizumab exhibited arrested follicular development or absent corpora lutea , as well as dose - related decreases in ovarian and uterine weights , endometrial proliferation , and the number of menstrual cycles .
Following a 4 - or 12 - week recovery period , there was a trend suggestive of reversibility .
After the 12 - week recovery period , follicular maturation arrest was no longer observed , but ovarian weights were still moderately decreased .
Reduced endometrial proliferation was no longer observed at the 12 - week recovery time point ; however , decreased uterine weight , absent corpora lutea , and reduced number of menstrual cycles remained evident .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Rabbits dosed with bevacizumab exhibited reduced wound healing capacity .
Using full - thickness skin incision and partial thickness circular dermal wound models , bevacizumab dosing resulted in reductions in wound tensile strength , decreased granulation and re - epithelialization , and delayed time to wound closure .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Study AVF2107g The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab was evaluated in a double - blind , active - controlled study [ AVF2107g ( NCT00109070 ) ] in 923 patients with previously untreated mCRC who were randomized ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) to placebo with bolus - IFL ( irinotecan 125 mg / m2 , fluorouracil 500 mg / m2 , and leucovorin 20 mg / m2 given once weekly for 4 weeks every 6 weeks ) , bevacizumab ( 5 mg / kg every 2 weeks ) with bolus - IFL , or bevacizumab ( 5 mg / kg every 2 weeks ) with fluorouracil and leucovorin .
Enrollment to the bevacizumab with fluorouracil and leucovorin arm was discontinued , after enrollment of 110 patients in accordance with the protocol - specified adaptive design .
Bevacizumab was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum of 96 weeks .
The main outcome measure was overall survival ( OS ) .
The median age was 60 years ; 60 % were male , 79 % were White , 57 % had an ECOG performance status of 0 , 21 % had a rectal primary and 28 % received prior adjuvant chemotherapy .
The dominant site of disease was extra - abdominal in 56 % of patients and was the liver in 38 % of patients .
The addition of bevacizumab improved survival across subgroups defined by age ( < 65 years , ≥ 65 years ) and sex .
Results are presented in Table 9 and Figure 1 .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Study E3200 The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab were evaluated in a randomized , open - label , active - controlled study [ E3200 ( NCT00025337 ) ] in 829 patients who were previously treated with irinotecan and fluorouracil for initial therapy for metastatic disease or as adjuvant therapy .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) to FOLFOX4 ( Day 1 : oxaliplatin 85 mg / m2 and leucovorin 200 mg / m2 concurrently , then fluorouracil 400 mg / m2 bolus followed by 600 mg / m2 continuously ; Day 2 : leucovorin 200 mg / m2 , then fluorouracil 400 mg / m2 bolus followed by 600 mg / m2 continuously ; every 2 weeks ) , bevacizumab ( 10 mg / kg every 2 weeks prior to FOLFOX4 on Day 1 ) with FOLFOX4 , or bevacizumab alone ( 10 mg / kg every 2 weeks ) .
Bevacizumab was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
The main outcome measure was OS .
The bevacizumab alone arm was closed to accrual after enrollment of 244 of the planned 290 patients following a planned interim analysis by the data monitoring committee based on evidence of decreased survival compared to FOLFOX4 alone .
The median age was 61 years ; 60 % were male , 87 % were White , 49 % had an ECOG performance status of 0 , 26 % received prior radiation therapy , and 80 % received prior adjuvant chemotherapy , 99 % received prior irinotecan with or without fluorouracil for metastatic disease , and 1 % received prior irinotecan and fluorouracil as adjuvant therapy .
The addition of bevacizumab to FOLFOX4 resulted in significantly longer survival as compared to FOLFOX4 alone ; median OS was 13 . 0 months vs . 10 . 8 months [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 0 . 75 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 63 , 0 . 89 ) , p - value of 0 . 001 stratified log - rank test ] with clinical benefit seen in subgroups defined by age ( < 65 years , ≥ 65 years ) and sex .
PFS and ORR based on investigator assessment were higher in patients receiving bevacizumab with FOLFOX4 .
Study TRC - 0301 The activity of bevacizumab with fluorouracil ( as bolus or infusion ) and leucovorin was evaluated in a single arm study [ TRC - 0301 ( NCT00066846 ) ] enrolling 339 patients with mCRC with disease progression following both irinotecan - and oxaliplatin - based chemotherapy .
Seventy - three percent of patients received concurrent bolus fluorouracil and leucovorin .
One objective partial response was verified in the first 100 evaluable patients for an ORR of 1 % ( 95 % CI : 0 % , 5 . 5 % ) .
Study ML18147 The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab were evaluated in a prospective , randomized , open - label , multinational , controlled study [ ML18147 ( NCT00700102 ) ] in 820 patients with histologically confirmed mCRC who had progressed on a first - line bevacizumab - containing regimen .
Patients were excluded if they progressed within 3 months of initiating first - line chemotherapy and if they received bevacizumab for less than 3 consecutive months in the first - line setting .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) within 3 months after discontinuing bevacizumab as first - line treatment to receive fluoropyrimidine - irinotecan - or fluoropyrimidine - oxaliplatin - based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab ( 5 mg / kg every 2 weeks or 7 . 5 mg / kg every 3 weeks ) .
The choice of second - line treatment was contingent upon first - line chemotherapy .
Second - line treatment was administered until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity .
The main outcome measure was OS .
A secondary outcome measure was ORR .
The median age was 63 years ( 21 to 84 years ) ; 64 % were male , 52 % had an ECOG performance status of 1 , 44 % had an ECOG performance status of 0 , 58 % received irinotecan - based therapy as first - line treatment , 55 % progressed on first - line treatment within 9 months , and 77 % received their last dose of bevacizumab as first - line treatment within 42 days of being randomized .
Second - line chemotherapy regimens were generally balanced between each arm .
The addition of bevacizumab to fluoropyrimidine - based chemotherapy resulted in a statistically significant prolongation of OS and PFS .
There was no significant difference in ORR .

The first study [ BO17920 ( NCT00112918 ) ] was conducted in 3451 patients with high - risk stage II and III colon cancer , who had undergone surgery for colon cancer with curative intent .
Patients were randomized to receive bevacizumab at a dose equivalent to 2 . 5 mg / kg / week on either a 2 - weekly schedule with FOLFOX4 ( N = 1155 ) or on a 3 - weekly schedule with XELOX ( N = 1145 ) or FOLFOX4 alone ( N = 1151 ) .
The main outcome measure was disease free survival ( DFS ) in patients with stage III colon cancer .
The median age was 58 years ; 54 % were male , 84 % were White and 29 % were ≥ 65 years .
Eighty - three percent had stage III disease .
The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy did not improve DFS .
As compared to FOLFOX4 alone , the proportion of stage III patients with disease recurrence or with death due to disease progression were numerically higher for patients receiving bevacizumab with FOLFOX4 or with XELOX .
The hazard ratios for DFS were 1 . 17 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 98 , 1 . 39 ) for bevacizumab with FOLFOX4 versus FOLFOX4 alone and 1 . 07 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 90 , 1 . 28 ) for bevacizumab with XELOX versus FOLFOX4 alone .
The hazard ratios for OS were 1 . 31 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 03 , 1 . 67 ) and 1 . 27 ( 95 % CI : 1 , 1 . 62 ) for the comparison of bevacizumab with FOLFOX4 versus FOLFOX4 alone and bevacizumab with XELOX versus FOLFOX4 alone , respectively .
Similar lack of efficacy for DFS was observed in the bevacizumab - containing arms compared to FOLFOX4 alone in the high - risk stage II cohort .
In a second study [ NSABP - C - 08 ( NCT00096278 ) ] , patients with stage II and III colon cancer who had undergone surgery with curative intent , were randomized to receive either bevacizumab administered at a dose equivalent to 2 . 5 mg / kg / week with mFOLFOX6 ( N = 1354 ) or mFOLFOX6 alone ( N = 1356 ) .
The median age was 57 years , 50 % were male and 87 % White .
Seventy - five percent had stage III disease .
The main outcome was DFS among stage III patients .
The HR for DFS was 0 . 92 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 77 , 1 . 10 ) .
OS was not significantly improved with the addition of bevacizumab to mFOLFOX6 [ HR 0 . 96 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 75 , 1 . 22 ) ] .
14 . 3 First - Line Non – Squamous Non – Small Cell Lung Cancer Study E4599 The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab as first - line treatment of patients with locally advanced , metastatic , or recurrent non - squamous NSCLC was studied in a single , large , randomized , active - controlled , open - label , multicenter study [ E4599 ( NCT00021060 ) ] .
A total of 878 chemotherapy - naïve patients with locally advanced , metastatic or recurrent non – squamous NSCLC were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive six 21 - day cycles of paclitaxel ( 200 mg / m2 ) and carboplatin ( AUC 6 ) with or without bevacizumab 15 mg / kg .
After completing or discontinuing chemotherapy , patients randomized to receive bevacizumab continued to receive bevacizumab alone until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity .
The trial excluded patients with predominant squamous histology ( mixed cell type tumors only ) , CNS metastasis , gross hemoptysis ( 1 / 2 teaspoon or more of red blood ) , unstable angina , or receiving therapeutic anticoagulation .
The main outcome measure was duration of survival .
The median age was 63 years ; 54 % were male , 43 % were ≥ 65 years , and 28 % had ≥ 5 % weight loss at study entry .
Eleven percent had recurrent disease .
Of the 89 % with newly diagnosed NSCLC , 12 % had Stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion and 76 % had Stage IV disease .
OS was statistically significantly longer for patients receiving bevacizumab with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone .
Median OS was 12 . 3 months vs . 10 . 3 months [ HR 0 . 80 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 68 , 0 . 94 ) , final p - value of 0 . 013 , stratified log - rank test ] .
Based on investigator assessment which was not independently verified , patients were reported to have longer PFS with bevacizumab with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared to chemotherapy alone .
Results are presented in Figure 3 .
Figure 3 : Kaplan - Meier Curves for Duration of Survival in First - Line Non - Squamous Non - Small Cell Lung Cancer in Study E4599 [ MULTIMEDIA ] In an exploratory analysis across patient subgroups , the impact of bevacizumab on OS was less robust in the following subgroups : women [ HR 0 . 99 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 79 , 1 . 25 ) ] , patients ≥ 65 years [ HR 0 . 91 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 72 , 1 . 14 ) ] and patients with ≥ 5 % weight loss at study entry [ HR 0 . 96 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 73 , 1 . 26 ) ] .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Study BO17704 The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced , metastatic or recurrent non - squamous NSCLC , who had not received prior chemotherapy was studied in another randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study [ BO17704 ( NCT00806923 ) ] .
A total of 1043 patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) to receive cisplatin and gemcitabine with placebo , bevacizumab 7 . 5 mg / kg or bevacizumab 15 mg / kg .
The main outcome measure was PFS .
Secondary outcome measure was OS .
The median age was 58 years ; 36 % were female and 29 % were ≥ 65 years .
Eight percent had recurrent disease and 77 % had Stage IV disease .
PFS was significantly higher in both bevacizumab - containing arms compared to the placebo arm [ HR 0 . 75 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 62 , 0 . 91 ) , p - value of 0 . 0026 for bevacizumab 7 . 5 mg / kg and HR 0 . 82 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 68 , 0 . 98 ) , p - value of 0 . 0301 for bevacizumab 15 mg / kg ] .
The addition of bevacizumab to cisplatin and gemcitabine failed to demonstrate an improvement in the duration of OS [ HR 0 . 93 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 78 , 1 . 11 ) , p - value of 0 . 420 for bevacizumab 7 . 5 mg / kg and HR 1 . 03 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 86 , 1 . 23 ) , p - value of 0 . 761 for bevacizumab 15 mg / kg ] .
14 . 4 Recurrent Glioblastoma Study EORTC 26101 The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab were evaluated in a multicenter , randomized ( 2 : 1 ) , open - label study in patients with recurrent GBM ( EORTC 26101 , NCT01290939 ) .
Patients with first progression following radiotherapy and temozolomide were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to receive bevacizumab ( 10 mg / kg every 2 weeks ) with lomustine ( 90 mg / m2 every 6 weeks ) or lomustine ( 110 mg / m2 every 6 weeks ) alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Randomization was stratified by World Health Organization performance status ( 0 vs . > 0 ) , steroid use ( yes vs . no ) , largest tumor diameter ( ≤ 40 vs . > 40 mm ) , and institution .
The main outcome measure was OS .
Secondary outcome measures were investigator - assessed PFS and ORR per the modified Response Assessment in Neuro - oncology ( RANO ) criteria , health related quality of life ( HRQoL ) , cognitive function , and corticosteroid use .
A total of 432 patients were randomized to receive lomustine alone ( N = 149 ) or bevacizumab with lomustine ( N = 283 ) .
The median age was 57 years ; 24 . 8 % of patients were ≥ 65 years .
The majority of patients with were male ( 61 % ) ; 66 % had a WHO performance status score > 0 ; and in 56 % the largest tumor diameter was ≤ 40 mm .
Approximately 33 % of patients randomized to receive lomustine received bevacizumab following documented progression .
No difference in OS ( HR 0 . 91 , p - value of 0 . 4578 ) was observed between arms ; therefore , all secondary outcome measures are descriptive only .
PFS was longer in the bevacizumab with lomustine arm [ HR 0 . 52 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 41 , 0 . 64 ) ] with a median PFS of 4 . 2 months in the bevacizumab with lomustine arm and 1 . 5 months in the lomustine arm .
Among the 50 % of patients receiving corticosteroids at the time of randomization , a higher percentage of patients in the bevacizumab with lomustine arm discontinued corticosteroids ( 23 % vs . 12 % ) .
Study AVF3708g and Study NCI 06 - C - 0064 E The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab 10 mg / kg every 2 weeks in patients with previously treated GBM were evaluated in one single arm single center study ( NCI 06 - C - 0064 E ) and a randomized noncomparative multicenter study [ AVF3708g ( NCT00345163 ) ] .
Response rates in both studies were evaluated based on modified WHO criteria that considered corticosteroid use .
In AVF3708g , the response rate was 25 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 17 % , 36 . 1 % ) with a median duration of response of 4 . 2 months ( 95 % CI : 3 , 5 . 7 ) .
In Study NCI 06 - C - 0064 E , the response rate was 19 . 6 % ( 95 % CI : 10 . 9 % , 31 . 3 % ) with a median duration of response of 3 . 9 months ( 95 % CI : 2 . 4 , 17 . 4 ) .
14 . 5 Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Study BO17705 The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab were evaluated in patients with treatment - naïve mRCC in a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , international study [ BO17705 ( NCT00738530 ) ] comparing interferon alfa and bevacizumab versus interferon alfa and placebo .
A total of 649 patients who had undergone a nephrectomy were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive either bevacizumab ( 10 mg / kg every 2 weeks ; N = 327 ) or placebo ( every 2 weeks ; N = 322 ) with interferon alfa ( 9 MIU subcutaneously three times weekly for a maximum of 52 weeks ) .
Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
The main outcome measure was investigator - assessed PFS .
Secondary outcome measures were ORR and OS .
The median age was 60 years ( 18 to 82 years ) ; 70 % were male and 96 % were White .
The study population was characterized by Motzer scores as follows : 28 % favorable ( 0 ) , 56 % intermediate ( 1 – 2 ) , 8 % poor ( 3 – 5 ) , and 7 % missing .
PFS was statistically significantly prolonged among patients receiving bevacizumab compared to placebo ; median PFS was 10 . 2 months vs . 5 . 4 months [ HR 0 . 60 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 49 , 0 . 72 ) , p - value < 0 . 0001 , stratified log - rank test ] .
Among the 595 patients with measurable disease , ORR was also significantly higher ( 30 % vs . 12 % , p - value < 0 . 0001 , stratified CMH test ) .
There was no improvement in OS based on the final analysis conducted after 444 deaths , with a median OS of 23 months in the patients receiving bevacizumab with interferon alfa and 21 months in patients receiving interferon alone [ HR 0 . 86 , ( 95 % CI : 0 . 72 , 1 . 04 ) ] .

A total of 452 patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 ) to receive paclitaxel and cisplatin with or without bevacizumab , or paclitaxel and topotecan with or without bevacizumab .
The dosing regimens for bevacizumab , paclitaxel , cisplatin and topotecan were as follows : • Day 1 : Paclitaxel 135 mg / m2 over 24 hours , Day 2 : cisplatin 50 mg / m2 with bevacizumab ; • Day 1 : Paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 over 3 hours , Day 2 : cisplatin 50 mg / m2 with bevacizumab ; • Day 1 : Paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 over 3 hours with cisplatin 50 mg / m2 with bevacizumab ; • Day 1 : Paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 over 3 hours with bevacizumab , Days 13 : topotecan IV 0 . 75 mg / m2 over 30 minutes .
Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable adverse reactions .
The main outcome measure was OS .
Secondary outcome measures included ORR .
The median age was 48 years ( 20 to 85 years ) .
Of the 452 patients randomized at baseline , 78 % of patients were White , 80 % had received prior radiation , 74 % had received prior chemotherapy concurrent with radiation , and 32 % had a platinum - free interval ( PFI ) of less than 6 months .
Patients had a GOG performance status of 0 ( 58 % ) or 1 ( 42 % ) .
Demographic and disease characteristics were balanced across arms .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 7 Stage III or IV Epithelial Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , or Primary Peritoneal Cancer Following Initial Surgical Resection Study GOG - 0218 The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab were evaluated in a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo controlled , three arm study [ Study GOG - 0218 ( NCT00262847 ) ] evaluating the effect of adding bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with stage III or IV epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer ( N = 1873 ) following initial surgical resection .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) to one of the following arms : • CPP : carboplatin ( AUC 6 ) and paclitaxel ( 175 mg / m2 ) for six cycles , with concurrent placebo started at cycle 2 , followed by placebo alone every three weeks for a total of up to 22 cycles of therapy ( n = 625 ) or • CPB15 : carboplatin ( AUC 6 ) and paclitaxel ( 175 mg / m2 ) for six cycles , with concurrent bevacizumab started at cycle 2 , followed by placebo alone every three weeks for a total of up to 22 cycles of therapy ( n = 625 ) or • CPB15 + : carboplatin ( AUC 6 ) and paclitaxel ( 175 mg / m2 ) for six cycles , with concurrent bevacizumab started at cycle 2 , followed by bevacizumab as a single agent every three weeks for a total of up to 22 cycles of therapy ( n = 623 ) .
The main outcome measure was investigator - assessed PFS .
OS was a secondary outcome measure .
The median age was 60 years ( range 22 - 89 years ) and 28 % of patients were > 65 years of age .
Overall , approximately 50 % of patients had a GOG PS of 0 at baseline , and 43 % a GOG PS score of 1 .
Patients had either epithelial ovarian cancer ( 83 % ) , primary peritoneal cancer ( 15 % ) , or fallopian tube cancer ( 2 % ) .
Serous adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type ( 85 % in CPP and CPB15 arms , 86 % in CPB15 + arm ) .
Overall , approximately 34 % of patients had resected FIGO Stage III with residual disease < 1 cm , 40 % had resected Stage III with residual disease > 1 cm , and 26 % had resected Stage IV disease .
The majority of patients in all three treatment arms received subsequent antineoplastic treatment , 78 . 1 % in the CPP arm , 78 . 6 % in the CPB15 arm , and 73 . 2 % in the CPB15 + arm .
A higher proportion of patients in the CPP arm ( 25 . 3 % ) and CPB15 arm ( 26 . 6 % ) received at least one anti - angiogenic ( including bevacizumab ) treatment after discontinuing from study compared with the CPB15 + arm ( 15 . 6 % ) .

Patients had received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens .
Patients received one of the following chemotherapy regimens at the discretion of the investigator : paclitaxel ( 80 mg / m2 on days 1 , 8 , 15 and 22 every 4 weeks ) ; pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( 40 mg / m2 on day 1 every 4 weeks ) ; or topotecan ( 4 mg / m2 on days 1 , 8 and 15 every 4 weeks or 1 . 25 mg / m2 on days 15 every 3 weeks ) .
Patients were treated until disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal .
Forty percent of patients on the chemotherapy alone arm received bevacizumab alone upon progression .
The main outcome measure was investigator - assessed PFS .
Secondary outcome measures were ORR and OS .
The median age was 61 years ( 25 to 84 years ) and 37 % of patients were ≥ 65 years .
Seventy - nine percent had measurable disease at baseline , 87 % had baseline CA - 125 levels ≥ 2 times ULN and 31 % had ascites at baseline .
Seventy - three percent had a PFI of 3 months to 6 months and 27 % had PFI of < 3 months .
ECOG performance status was 0 for 59 % , 1 for 34 % , and 2 for 7 % of the patients .
The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in investigator - assessed PFS , which was supported by a retrospective independent review analysis .
Results for the ITT population are presented in Table 14 and Figure 7 .
Results for the separate chemotherapy cohorts are presented in Table 15 .
