Potassium chloride extended - release tablets should not be taken on an empty stomach because of their potential for gastric irritation [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified with use of oral potassium salts .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The most common adverse reactions to oral potassium salts are nausea , vomiting , flatulence , abdominal pain / discomfort , and diarrhea .
There have been reports of hyperkalemia and of upper and lower gastrointestinal conditions including obstruction , bleeding , ulceration , perforation .
Skin rash has been reported rarely .
• • The most common adverse reactions are nausea , vomiting , flatulence , abdominal pain / discomfort and diarrhea .
( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Mylan at 1 - 877 - 446 - 3679 ( 1 - 877 - 4 - INFO - RX ) or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
• • Triamterene and amiloride : Concomitant use is contraindicated .
( 7 . 1 ) • • Renin - angiotensin - aldosterone inhibitors : Monitor for hyperkalemia .
( 7 . 2 ) • • Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs : Monitor for hyperkalemia .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Triamterene or Amiloride Use with triamterene or amiloride can produce severe hyperkalemia .
Concomitant use is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
7 . 2 Renin - angiotensin - aldosterone Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system ( RAAS ) including angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) , spironolactone , eplerenone , or aliskiren produce potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production .
Closely monitor potassium in patients on concomitant RAAS inhibitors .
7 . 3 Nonsteroidal Anti - inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) NSAIDS may produce potassium retention by reducing renal synthesis of prostaglandin E and impairing the renin - angiotensin system .
Closely monitor potassium in patients on concomitant NSAIDs .
• • Cirrhosis : Initiate therapy at the low end of the dosing range .
( 8 . 6 ) • • Renal Impairment : Initiate therapy at the low end of the dosing range .
( 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no human data related to use of potassium chloride extended - release tablets during pregnancy , and animal reproduction studies have not been conducted .
Potassium supplementation that does not lead to hyperkalemia is not expected to cause fetal harm .
The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage in the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The normal potassium ion content of human milk is about 13 mEq per liter .
Since oral potassium becomes part of the body potassium pool , so long as body potassium is not excessive , the contribution of potassium chloride supplementation should have little or no effect on the level in human milk .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of potassium chloride extended - release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
8 . 6 Cirrhotics Based on published literature , the baseline corrected serum concentrations of potassium measured over 3 hours after administration in cirrhotic subjects who received an oral potassium load rose to approximately twice that of normal subjects who received the same load .
Patients with cirrhosis should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range , and the serum potassium level should be monitored frequently [ seeClinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment have reduced urinary excretion of potassium and are at substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia .
Patients with impaired renal function , particularly if the patient is on RAAS inhibitors or NSAIDs , should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range because of the potential for development of hyperkalemia [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) ] .
The serum potassium level should be monitored frequently .
Renal function should be assessed periodically .
10 OVERDOSAGE 10 . 1 Symptoms The administration of oral potassium salts to persons with normal excretory mechanisms for potassium rarely causes serious hyperkalemia .
However , if excretory mechanisms are impaired , potentially fatal hyperkalemia can result .
It is important to recognize that hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic and may be manifested only by an increased serum potassium concentration ( 6 . 5 to 8 . 0 mEq / L ) and characteristic electrocardiographic changes ( peaking of T - waves , loss of P - wave , depression of S - T segment and prolongation of the QT interval ) .
Late manifestations include muscle paralysis and cardiovascular collapse from cardiac arrest ( 9 to 12 mEq / L ) .
10 . 2 Treatment Treatment measures for hyperkalemia include the following : • 1 .
Elimination of foods and medications containing potassium and of any agents with potassium - sparing properties .
• 2 .
Intravenous administration of 300 to 500 mL / hr of 10 % dextrose solution containing 10 to 20 units of crystalline insulin per 1 , 000 mL .
• 3 .
Correction of acidosis , if present , with intravenous sodium bicarbonate .
• 4 .
Use of exchange resins , hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis .
In treating hyperkalemia , it should be recalled that in patients who have been stabilized on digitalis , too rapid a lowering of the serum potassium concentration can produce digitalis toxicity .
The extended release feature means that absorption and toxic effects may be delayed for hours .
Consider standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The potassium ion is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues .
Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity , the transmission of nerve impulses , the contraction of cardiac , skeletal and smooth muscle and the maintenance of normal renal function .
The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter .
The normal adult plasma concentration is 3 . 5 to 5 mEq per liter .
An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane .
Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine .
The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The potassium chloride in potassium chloride extended - release tablets is completely absorbed before it leaves the small intestine .
The matrix is not absorbed and is excreted in the feces ; in some instances the empty matrices may be noticeable in the stool .
When the bioavailability of the potassium ion from the potassium chloride extended - release tablets is compared to that of a true solution the extent of absorption is similar .
The extended - release properties of potassium chloride extended - release tablets are demonstrated by the finding that a significant increase in time is required for renal excretion of the first 50 % of the potassium chloride extended - release tablets dose as compared to the solution .
Increased urinary potassium excretion is first observed 1 hour after administration of potassium chloride extended - release tablets , reaches a peak at approximately 4 hours , and extends up to 8 hours .
Mean daily steady - state plasma levels of potassium following daily administration of potassium chloride extended - release tablets cannot be distinguished from those following administration of potassium chloride solution or from control plasma levels of potassium ion .
Specific Populations Cirrhotics Based on published literature , the baseline corrected serum concentrations of potassium measured over 3 hours after administration in cirrhotic subjects who received an oral potassium load rose to approximately twice that of normal subjects who received the same load .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity , mutagenicity and fertility studies in animals have not been performed .
Potassium is a normal dietary constituent .
