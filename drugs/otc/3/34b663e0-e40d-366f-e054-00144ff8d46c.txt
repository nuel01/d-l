Sumatriptan tablets , USP are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults .
Limitations of Use : Use only if a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established .
If a patient has no response to the first migraine attack treated with sumatriptan tablets , USP , reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before sumatriptan tablets , USP are administered to treat any subsequent attacks .
Sumatriptan tablets , USP are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks .
Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets , USP have not been established for cluster headache .
2 . 1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of sumatriptan tablets is 25 mg , 50 mg , or 100 mg .
Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25 mg dose , but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50 mg dose .
Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions [ see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 ) ] .
If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan tablets , or returns after a transient improvement , a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose .
The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24 - hour period .
Use after Sumatriptan Injection : If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection , additional single sumatriptan tablets ( up to 100 mg / day ) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses .
The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30 - day period has not been established .
2 . 2 Dosing in Patients With Hepatic Impairment If treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of mild to moderate hepatic impairment , the maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg [ see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8 . 6 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with : Ischemic coronary artery disease ( CAD ) ( angina pectoris , history of myocardial infarction , or documented silent ischemia ) or coronary artery vasospasm , including Prinzmetal ’ s angina [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] Wolff - Parkinson - White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) ] History of stroke or transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) or history of hemiplegic or basilar migraine because these patients are at a higher risk of stroke [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 4 ) ] Peripheral vascular disease [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 5 ) ] Ischemic bowel disease [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 5 ) ] Uncontrolled hypertension [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 8 ) ] Recent use ( i . e . , within 24 hours ) of ergotamine - containing medication , ergot - type medication ( such as dihydroergotamine or methysergide ) , or another 5 - hydroxytryptamine1 ( 5 - HT1 ) agonist [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 3 ) ] Concurrent administration of a monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) - A inhibitor or recent ( within 2 weeks ) use of an MAO - A inhibitor [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 . 2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] Hypersensitivity to sumatriptan tablets ( angioedema and anaphylaxis seen ) [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 9 ) ] Severe hepatic impairment [ see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8 . 6 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] 5 . 1 Myocardial Ischemia , Myocardial Infarction , and Prinzmetal ’ s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD .
There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions , including acute myocardial infarction , occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets .
Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD .
Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm ( Prinzmetal ’ s angina ) , even in patients without a history of CAD .
Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan - naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( e . g . , increased age , diabetes , hypertension , smoking , obesity , strong family history of CAD ) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets .
If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm , sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated .
For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation , consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram ( ECG ) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets .
For such patients , consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long - term users of sumatriptan tablets .
5 . 2 Arrhythmias Life - threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm , including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death , have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5 - HT1 agonists .
Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur .
Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff - Parkinson - White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders .
5 . 3 Chest , Throat , Neck , and / or Jaw Pain / Tightness / Pressure Sensations of tightness , pain , pressure , and heaviness in the precordium , throat , neck , and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non - cardiac in origin .
However , perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk .
The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal ’ s variant angina .
5 . 4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage , subarachnoid hemorrhage , and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5 - HT1 agonists , and some have resulted in fatalities .
In a number of cases , it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary , the 5 - HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not .
Also , patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events ( e . g . , stroke , hemorrhage , TIA ) .
Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs .
Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs , and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms , exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions .
Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA .
5 . 5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non - coronary vasospastic reactions , such as peripheral vascular ischemia , gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction ( presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea ) , splenic infarction , and Raynaud ’ s syndrome .
In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non - coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5 - HT1 agonist , rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets .
Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5 - HT1 agonists .
Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack , a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5 - HT1 agonists have not been clearly established .
5 . 6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs ( e . g . , ergotamine , triptans , opioids , or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month ) may lead to exacerbation of headache ( medication overuse headache ) .
Medication overuse headache may present as migraine - like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks .
Detoxification of patients , including withdrawal of the overused drugs , and treatment of withdrawal symptoms ( which often includes a transient worsening of headache ) may be necessary .
5 . 7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets , particularly during co - administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) , tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) , and MAO inhibitors [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 . 4 ) ] .
Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes ( e . g . , agitation , hallucinations , coma ) , autonomic instability ( e . g . , tachycardia , labile blood pressure , hyperthermia ) , neuromuscular aberrations ( e . g . , hyperreflexia , incoordination ) , and / or gastrointestinal symptoms ( e . g . , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ) .
The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication .
Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected .
5 . 8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure , including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems , has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5 - HT1 agonists , including patients without a history of hypertension .
Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan .
Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension .
5 . 9 Anaphylactic / Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan .
Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal .
In general , anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens .
Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan .
5 . 10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan .
Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures .
There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent .
Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold .
than the placebo group are included in Table 1 .
Table 1 .
Adverse Reactions Reported by at Least 2 % of Patients Treated With Sumatriptan Tablets and at a Greater Frequency Than Placebo Adverse Reaction Percent of Patients Reporting Sumatriptan Tablets 25 mg ( n = 417 ) Sumatriptan Tablets 50 mg ( n = 771 ) Sumatriptan Tablets 100 mg ( n = 437 ) Placebo ( n = 309 ) Atypical sensations Paresthesia ( all types ) Sensation warm / cold 5 3 3 6 5 2 6 3 3 4 2 2 Pain and other pressure sensations 6 6 8 4 Chest - pain / tightness / pressure and / or heaviness 1 2 2 1 Neck / throat / jaw - pain / tightness / pressure < 1 2 3 < 1 Pain - location specified 2 1 1 1 Other - pressure / tightness / heaviness 1 1 3 2 Neurological Vertigo < 1 < 1 2 < 1 Other Malaise / fatigue 2 2 3 < 1 The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients .
There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets , sumatriptan nasal spray , and sumatriptan injection .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness , frequency of reporting , or causal connection to sumatriptan or a combination of these factors .
Cardiovascular : Hypotension , palpitations .
Neurological : Dystonia , tremor .
7 . 1 Ergot - Containing Drugs Ergot - containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions .
Because these effects may be additive , use of ergotamine - containing or ergot - type medications ( like dihydroergotamine or methysergide ) and sumatriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated .
7 . 2 Monoamine Oxidase - A Inhibitors MAO - A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7 - fold .
Therefore , the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO - A inhibitors is contraindicated [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Other 5 - HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive , co - administration of sumatriptan tablets and other 5 - HT1 agonists ( e . g . , triptans ) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated .
7 . 4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors / Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co - administration of triptans and SSRIs , SNRIs , TCAs , and MAO inhibitors [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C : There are no adequate and well - controlled trials in pregnant women .
In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits , oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality , fetal abnormalities , and pup mortality .
When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits , sumatriptan was embryolethal .
Sumatriptan tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel ( cervicothoracic and umbilical ) abnormalities .
The highest no - effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg / kg / day , or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 200 mg / day on a mg / m2 basis .
Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities .
Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality .
The highest oral and intravenous no - effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 ( approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) and 0 . 75 mg / kg / day , respectively .
Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity ( decreased body weight , decreased ossification , increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities ) .
The highest no - effect dose was 50 mg / kg / day , or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis .
In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis , there was a decrease in pup survival .
The highest no - effect dose for this effect was 60 mg / kg / day , or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis .
Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival .
The highest no - effect dose for this finding was 100 mg / kg / day , or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration .
Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Sumatriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age .
Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray ( 5 to 20 mg ) in 1 , 248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack .
The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents .
Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults .
Five controlled clinical trials ( 2 single - attack trials , 3 multiple - attack trials ) evaluating oral sumatriptan ( 25 to 100 mg ) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs .
These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents .
Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults .
The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose - and age - dependent , with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents .
Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous , oral , and / or intranasal sumatriptan .
These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults , including stroke , visual loss , and death .
A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14 - year - old male following the use of oral sumatriptan ; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration .
Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous , oral , or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors ( e . g . , diabetes , hypertension , smoking , obesity , strong family history of CAD ) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg .
Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients in clinical trials ( N = 670 ) received single oral doses of 140 to 300 mg without significant adverse reactions .
Volunteers ( N = 174 ) received single oral doses of 140 to 400 mg without serious adverse reactions .
Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions , tremor , paralysis , inactivity , ptosis , erythema of the extremities , abnormal respiration , cyanosis , ataxia , mydriasis , salivation , and lacrimation .
The elimination half - life of sumatriptan is approximately 2 . 5 hours [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] , and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan tablets should continue for at least 12 hours or while symptoms or signs persist .
It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan .
Sumatriptan tablets , USP contain sumatriptan succinate , a selective 5 - HT1B / 1 D receptor agonist .
Sumatriptan succinate is chemically designated as 3 - [ 2 - ( dimethylamino ) ethyl ] - N - methyl - indole - 5 - methanesulfonamide succinate ( 1 : 1 ) , and it has the following structure : Chemical Structure The molecular formula is C14H21N3O2S • C4H6O4 , representing a molecular weight of 413 . 5 .
Sumatriptan succinate USP is a white to off - white powder that is readily soluble in water and in saline .
Each sumatriptan tablet , USP for oral administration contains 35 mg , 70 mg , or 140 mg of sumatriptan succinate USP equivalent to 25 mg , 50 mg , or 100 mg of sumatriptan , respectively .
Each tablet also contains the inactive ingredients croscarmellose sodium , dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , polysorbate 80 , and sodium bicarbonate .
12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5 - HT1B / 1 D receptors .
Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5 - HT1B / 1 D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system , which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro - inflammatory neuropeptide release .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure : Significant elevation in blood pressure , including hypertensive crisis , has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
Peripheral ( Small ) Arteries : In healthy volunteers ( N = 18 ) , a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral ( small vessel ) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance .
Heart Rate : Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan ’ s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability : The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng / mL ( range : 7 to 47 ng / mL ) and 51 ng / mL ( range : 28 to 100 ng / mL ) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan .
This compares with a Cmax of 5 and 16 ng / mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose , respectively .
The mean Cmax following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng / mL ( range : 49 to 110 ng / mL ) .
The bioavailability is approximately 15 % , primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption .
The Cmax is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine - free period , but the Tmax is slightly later during the attack , approximately 2 . 5 hours compared with 2 hours .
When given as a single dose , sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption ( area under the curve [ AUC ] ) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg , but the Cmax after 100 mg is approximately 25 % less than expected ( based on the 25 mg dose ) .
A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high - fat meal indicated that the Cmax and AUC were increased by 15 % and 12 % , respectively , when administered in the fed state .
Distribution : Protein binding , determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1 , 000 ng / mL is low , approximately 14 % to 21 % .
The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated .
The apparent volume of distribution is 2 . 7 L / kg .
Metabolism : In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO , predominantly the A isoenzyme .
Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid ( IAA ) or the IAA glucuronide , both of which are inactive .
Elimination : The elimination half - life of sumatriptan is approximately 2 . 5 hours .
Radiolabeled 14 C - sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted ( about 60 % ) with about 40 % found in the feces .
Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite , indole acetic acid ( IAA ) , which is inactive , or the IAA glucuronide .
Only 3 % of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan .
Special Populations : Age : The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly ( mean age : 72 years , 2 males and 4 females ) and in subjects with migraine ( mean age : 38 years , 25 males and 155 females ) were similar to that in healthy male subjects ( mean age : 30 years ) .
Renal Impairment : The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined .
Hepatic Impairment : The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan .
Accordingly , the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease .
In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment ( n = 8 ) matched for sex , age , and weight with healthy subjects ( n = 8 ) , the hepatically - impaired patients had an approximately 70 % increase in AUC and Cmax and a Tmax 40 minutes earlier compared to the healthy subjects .
The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied .
The use of sumatriptan tablets in this population is contraindicated [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Gender : In a trial comparing females to males , no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC , Cmax , Tmax , and half - life .
Race : The systemic clearance and Cmax of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black ( n = 34 ) and Caucasian ( n = 38 ) healthy male subjects .
Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences .
Drug Interaction Studies : Monoamine Oxidase - A Inhibitors : Treatment with MAO - A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) and DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first - pass effects , the increase of systemic exposure after co - administration of an MAO - A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after co administration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan .
In a trial of 14 healthy females , pretreatment with an MAO - A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan , resulting in a 2 - fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration - time curve ( AUC ) , corresponding to a 40 % increase in elimination half - life .
A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO - A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7 - fold increase in systemic exposure .
Alcohol : Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan .
13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis : In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat , sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 and 104 weeks , respectively , at doses up to 160 mg / kg / day ( the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg / kg / day during week 21 ) .
There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration .
Plasma exposures ( AUC ) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 200 mg / day .
Mutagenesis : Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro ( bacterial reverse mutation [ Ames ] , gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79 / HGPRT , chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes ) and in vivo ( rat micronucleus ) assays .
Impairment of Fertility : When sumatriptan ( 5 , 50 , 500 mg / kg / day ) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period , there was a treatment - related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg / kg / day ( less than the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities : Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium .
Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested , 2 mg / kg / day , and were present after 1 month of treatment .
Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60 - week study .
Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no - effect doses were not established .
Plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 2 times that in humans at the MRHD .
