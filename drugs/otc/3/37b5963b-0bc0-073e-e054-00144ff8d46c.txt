DESCRIPTION Phendimetrazine tartrate , as the dextro isomer , has the chemical name of ( 2 S , 3 S ) - 3 , 4 - Dimethyl - 2 - phenylmorpholine L - ( + ) - tartrate ( 1 : 1 ) .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Phendimetrazine tartrate is a white , odorless crystalline powder .
It is freely soluble in water ; sparingly soluble in warm alcohol , insoluble in chloroform , acetone , ether and benzene .
Each tablet , for oral administration , contains 35 mg of phendimetrazine tartrate .
In addition , each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients : colloidal silicon dioxide , croscarmellose sodium , dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose and FD & C Yellow # 6 , D & C Yellow # 10 as coloring .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Phendimetrazine tartrate is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacological activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity , the amphetamines .
Actions include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure .
Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for .
Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as “ anorectics ” or “ anorexigenics ” .
It has not been established , however , that the action of such drugs in treating obesity is primarily one of appetite suppression .
Other central nervous system actions or metabolic effects , may be involved for example .
Adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with anorectic drugs , lose more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet , as determined in relatively short term clinical trials .
The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug - treated patients over placebo - treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week .
The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks .
The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects is not established .
The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an anorectic drug varies from trial to trial , and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drug prescribed , such as the physician investigator , the population treated , and the diet prescribed .
Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non - drug factors on weight loss .
The natural history of obesity is measured in years , whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks duration ; thus , the total impact of drug - induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited .
The major route of elimination is via the kidneys where most of the drug and metabolites are excreted .
Some of the drug is metabolized to phenmetrazine and also phendimetrazine - N - oxide .
The average half - life of elimination when studied under controlled conditions is about 3 . 7 hours for both the extended - release and immediate release forms .
The absorption half - life of the drug from the immediate release 35 mg phendimetrazine tablets is appreciably more rapid than the absorption rate of the drug from the extended - release formulation .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phendimetrazine tartrate tablets are indicated in the management of exogenous obesity as a short term adjunct ( a few weeks ) in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction in patients with an initial body mass index ( BMI ) of 30 kg / m 2 or higher who have not responded to appropriate weight reducing regimen ( diet and / or exercise ) alone .
Below is a chart of Body Mass Index ( BMI ) based on various heights and weights .
BMI is calculated by taking the patient ' s weight , in kilograms ( kg ) , divided by the patient ' s height , in meters ( m ) , squared .
Metric conversions are as follows : pounds ÷ 2 . 2 = kg ; inches × 0 . 0254 = meters .

CONTRAINDICATIONS Known hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions to sympathomimetics .
Advanced arteriosclerosis , symptomatic cardiovascular disease , moderate and severe hypertension , hyperthyroidism , and glaucoma .
Highly nervous or agitated patients .
Patients with a history of drug abuse .
Patients taking other CNS stimulants , including monoamine oxidase inhibitors .
WARNINGS Phendimetrazinetartrate should not be used in combination with other anorectic agents , including prescribed drugs , over - the - counter preparations and herbal products .
In a case - control epidemiological study , the use of anorectic agents , including phendimetrazine tartrate , was associated with an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension , a rare , but often fatal disorder .
The use of anorectic agents for longer than three months was associated with a 23 - fold increase in the risk of developing pulmonary hypertension .
Increased risk of pulmonary hypertension with repeated courses of therapy cannot be excluded .
The onset or aggravation of exertional dyspnea , or unexplained symptoms of angina pectoris , syncope , or lower extremity edema suggest the possibility of occurrence of pulmonary hypertension .
Under these circumstances , phendimetrazine tartrate should be immediately discontinued , and the patient should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension .
Valvular heart disease associated with the use of some anorectic agents such as fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine has been reported .
Possible contributing factors include use for extended periods of time , higher than recommended dose , and / or use in combination with other anorectic drugs .
However , no cases of this valvulopathy have been reported when phendimetrazinetartrate has been used alone .
The potential risk of possible serious adverse effects such as valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension should be assessed carefully against the potential benefit of weight loss .
Baseline cardiac evaluation should be considered to detect pre - existing valvular heart diseases or pulmonary hypertension prior to initiation of phendimetrazine treatment .
Phendimetrazine tartrate is not recommended in patients with known heart murmur or valvular heart disease .
Echocardiogram during and after treatment could be useful for detecting any valvular disorders which may occur .
To limit unwarranted exposure and risks , treatment with phendimetrazine tartrate should be continued only if the patient has satisfactory weight loss within the first 4 weeks of treatment ( i . e . , weight loss of at least 4 pounds , or as determined by the physician and patient ) .
Tolerance to the anorectic effect of phendimetrazine develops within a few weeks .
When this occurs , its use should be discontinued ; the maximum recommended dose should not be exceeded .
Use of phendimetrazine tartrate within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in a hypertensive crisis .
Abrupt cessation of administration following prolonged high dosage results in extreme fatigue and depression .
Because of the effect on the central nervous system , phendimetrazine tartrate may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle ; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly .
Phendimetrazine tartrate is not recommended for patients who used any anorectic agents within the prior year .
PRECAUTIONS Caution is to be exercised in prescribing phendimetrazine for patients with even mild hypertension .
Insulin requirements in diabetes mellitus may be altered in association with the use of phendimetrazine tartrate and the concomitant dietary regimen .
Phendimetrazine may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine .
The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage .
Drug Interactions Efficacy of phendimetrazine tartrate with other anorectic agents has not been studied and the combined use may have the potential for serious cardiac problems .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies with phendimetrazine tartrate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenesic potential , mutagenesic potential or effects on fertility .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phendimetrazine tartrate .
It is also not known whether phendimetrazine tartrate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Usage in Pregnancy Safe use in pregnancy has not been established .
Until more information is available , phendimetrazine tartrate should not be taken by women who are or may become pregnant unless , in the opinion of the physician , the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , phendimetrazine tartrate should not be taken by women who are nursing unless , in the opinion of the physician , the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Cardiovascular : Palpitation , tachycardia , elevated blood pressure , ischemic events .
Valvular heart disease associated with the use of some anorectic agents such as fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine , both independently and especially when used in combination with other anorectic drugs , have been reported .
However , no cases of this valvulopathy have been reported when phendimetrazine tartrate has been used alone .
Central Nervous System : Overstimulation , restlessness , insomnia , agitation , flushing , tremor , sweating , dizziness , headache , psychotic state , blurring of vision .
Gastrointestinal : Dryness of the mouth , nausea , diarrhea , constipation , stomach pain .
Genitourinary : Urinary frequency , dysuria , changes in libido .
DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance Phendimetrazine tartrate tablets are a Schedule III controlled substance .
Dependence Phendimetrazine tartrate is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amphetamines .
Amphetamines and related stimulant drugs have been extensively abused , and the possibility of abuse of phendimetrazine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program .
Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction .
There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage to many times that recommended .
Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression ; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG .
Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses , marked insomnia , irritability , hyperactivity and personality changes .
The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxications is psychosis , often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia .
OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with phendimetrazine tartrate may manifest itself by the following signs and symptoms : unusual restlessness , confusion , belligerence , hallucinations , and panic states .
Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation .
Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmias , hypertension , or hypotension and circulatory collapse .
Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and abdominal cramps .
Poisoning may result in convulsions , coma , and death .
The management of overdosage is largely symptomatic .
It includes sedation with a barbiturate .
If hypertension is marked , the use of a nitrate or rapid - acting alpha receptor - blocking agent should be considered .
Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendations for its use .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Usual Adult Dosage : 1 tablet ( 35 mg ) twice a day or three times a day one hour before meals .
Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dosage .
In some cases , 1 / 2 tablet ( 17 . 5 mg ) per dose may be adequate .
Dosage should not exceed 2 tablets three times a day .
