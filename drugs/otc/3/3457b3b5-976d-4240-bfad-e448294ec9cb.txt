DIABETES Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas , a large gland that lies near the stomach .
This hormone is necessary for the body ’ s correct use of food , especially sugar .
Diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not make enough insulin to meet your body ’ s needs .
To control your diabetes , your doctor has prescribed injections of insulin products to keep your blood glucose at a near – normal level .
You have been instructed to test your blood and / or your urine regularly for glucose .
Studies have shown that some chronic complications of diabetes such as eye disease , kidney disease , and nerve disease can be significantly reduced if the blood sugar is maintained as close to normal as possible .
The American Diabetes Association recommends that if your pre – meal glucose levels are consistently above 130 mg / dL or your hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) is more than 7 % , you should talk to your doctor .
A change in your diabetes therapy may be needed .
If your blood tests consistently show below – normal glucose levels , you should also let your doctor know .
Proper control of your diabetes requires close and constant cooperation with your doctor .
Despite diabetes , you can lead an active and healthy life if you eat a balanced diet , exercise regularly , and take your insulin injections as prescribed by your doctor .
Always keep an extra supply of insulin as well as a spare syringe and needle on hand .
Always wear diabetic identification so that appropriate treatment can be given if complications occur away from home .

DOSAGE Your doctor has told you which insulin to use , how much , and when and how often to inject it .
Because each patient ’ s diabetes is different , this schedule has been individualized for you .
Your usual dose of Humulin 70 / 30 may be affected by changes in your diet , activity , or work schedule .
Carefully follow your doctor ’ s instructions to allow for these changes .
Other things that may affect your Humulin 70 / 30 dose are : Illness Illness , especially with nausea and vomiting , may cause your insulin requirements to change .
Even if you are not eating , you will still require insulin .
You and your doctor should establish a sick day plan for you to use in case of illness .
When you are sick , test your blood glucose frequently .
If instructed by your doctor , test your ketones and report the results to your doctor .
Pregnancy Good control of diabetes is especially important for you and your unborn baby .
Pregnancy may make managing your diabetes more difficult .
If you are planning to have a baby , are pregnant , or are nursing a baby , talk to your doctor .
Medication Insulin requirements may be increased if you are taking other drugs with blood – glucose – raising activity , such as oral contraceptives , corticosteroids , or thyroid replacement therapy .
Insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of drugs that lower blood glucose or affect how your body responds to insulin , such as oral antidiabetic agents , salicylates ( for example , aspirin ) , sulfa antibiotics , alcohol , certain antidepressants and some kidney and blood pressure medicines .
Your Health Care Professional may be aware of other medications that may affect your diabetes control .
Therefore , always discuss any medications you are taking with your doctor .
Exercise Exercise may lower your body ’ s need for insulin during and for some time after the physical activity .
Exercise may also speed up the effect of an insulin dose , especially if the exercise involves the area of injection site ( for example , the leg should not be used for injection just prior to running ) .
Discuss with your doctor how you should adjust your insulin regimen to accommodate exercise .
Travel When traveling across more than 2 time zones , you should talk to your doctor concerning adjustments in your insulin schedule .
COMMON PROBLEMS OF DIABETES Hypoglycemia ( Low Blood Sugar ) Hypoglycemia ( too little glucose in the blood ) is one of the most frequent adverse events experienced by insulin users .
It can be brought about by : • Missing or delaying meals .
• Taking too much insulin .
• Exercising or working more than usual .
• An infection or illness associated with diarrhea or vomiting .
• A change in the body ’ s need for insulin .
• Diseases of the adrenal , pituitary , or thyroid gland , or progression of kidney or liver disease .
• Interactions with certain drugs , such as oral antidiabetic agents , salicylates ( for example , aspirin ) , sulfa antibiotics , certain antidepressants and some kidney and blood pressure medicines .
• Consumption of alcoholic beverages .
Symptoms of mild to moderate hypoglycemia may occur suddenly and can include : • sweating • drowsiness • dizziness • sleep disturbances • palpitation • anxiety • tremor • blurred vision • hunger • slurred speech • restlessness • depressed mood • tingling in the hands , feet , lips , or tongue • irritability • lightheadedness • abnormal behavior • inability to concentrate • unsteady movement • headache • personality changes Signs of severe hypoglycemia can include : • disorientation • seizures • unconsciousness • death Therefore , it is important that assistance be obtained immediately .
Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions , such as long duration of diabetes , diabetic nerve disease , use of medications such as beta – blockers , changing insulin preparations , or intensified control ( 3 or more insulin injections per day ) of diabetes .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycemic reactions after transfer from animal – source insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Without recognition of early warning symptoms , you may not be able to take steps to avoid more serious hypoglycemia .
Be alert for all of the various types of symptoms that may indicate hypoglycemia .
Patients who experience hypoglycemia without early warning symptoms should monitor their blood glucose frequently , especially prior to activities such as driving .
If the blood glucose is below your normal fasting glucose , you should consider eating or drinking sugar – containing foods to treat your hypoglycemia .
Mild to moderate hypoglycemia may be treated by eating foods or drinks that contain sugar .
Patients should always carry a quick source of sugar , such as hard candy or glucose tablets .
More severe hypoglycemia may require the assistance of another person .
Patients who are unable to take sugar orally or who are unconscious require an injection of glucagon or should be treated with intravenous administration of glucose at a medical facility .
You should learn to recognize your own symptoms of hypoglycemia .
If you are uncertain about these symptoms , you should monitor your blood glucose frequently to help you learn to recognize the symptoms that you experience with hypoglycemia .
If you have frequent episodes of hypoglycemia or experience difficulty in recognizing the symptoms , you should talk to your doctor to discuss possible changes in therapy , meal plans , and / or exercise programs to help you avoid hypoglycemia .
Hyperglycemia ( High Blood Sugar ) and Diabetic Ketoacidosis ( DKA ) Hyperglycemia ( too much glucose in the blood ) may develop if your body has too little insulin .
Hyperglycemia can be brought about by any of the following : • Omitting your insulin or taking less than your doctor has prescribed .
• Eating significantly more than your meal plan suggests .
• Developing a fever , infection , or other significant stressful situation .
In patients with type 1 or insulin – dependent diabetes , prolonged hyperglycemia can result in DKA ( a life - threatening emergency ) .
The first symptoms of DKA usually come on gradually , over a period of hours or days , and include a drowsy feeling , flushed face , thirst , loss of appetite , and fruity odor on the breath .
With DKA , blood and urine tests show large amounts of glucose and ketones .
Heavy breathing and a rapid pulse are more severe symptoms .
If uncorrected , prolonged hyperglycemia or DKA can lead to nausea , vomiting , stomach pain , dehydration , loss of consciousness , or death .
Therefore , it is important that you obtain medical assistance immediately .
Lipodystrophy Rarely , administration of insulin subcutaneously can result in lipoatrophy ( seen as an apparent depression of the skin ) or lipohypertrophy ( seen as a raised area of the skin ) .
If you notice either of these conditions , talk to your doctor .
A change in your injection technique may help alleviate the problem .
Allergy Local Allergy — Patients occasionally experience redness , swelling , and itching at the site of injection .
This condition , called local allergy , usually clears up in a few days to a few weeks .
In some instances , this condition may be related to factors other than insulin , such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique .
If you have local reactions , talk to your doctor .
Systemic Allergy — Less common , but potentially more serious , is generalized allergy to insulin , which may cause rash over the whole body , shortness of breath , wheezing , reduction in blood pressure , fast pulse , or sweating .
Severe cases of generalized allergy may be life threatening .
If you think you are having a generalized allergic reaction to insulin , call your doctor immediately .
