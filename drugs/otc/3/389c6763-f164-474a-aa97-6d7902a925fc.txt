• A history of thrombocytopenia following prior exposure to AGGRASTAT [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
• Active internal bleeding or a history of bleeding diathesis , major surgical procedure or severe physical trauma within the previous month [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
• Known hypersensitivity to any component of AGGRASTAT .
( 4 ) • History of thrombocytopenia with prior exposure to AGGRASTAT .
( 4 ) • Active internal bleeding , or history of bleeding diathesis , major surgical procedure or severe physical trauma within the previous month .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • AGGRASTAT can cause serious bleeding .
If bleeding cannot be controlled discontinue AGGRASTAT .
( 5 . 1 ) • Thrombocytopenia : Discontinue AGGRASTAT and heparin .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 General Risk of Bleeding Bleeding is the most common complication encountered during therapy with AGGRASTAT .
Most bleeding associated with AGGRASTAT occurs at the arterial access site for cardiac catheterization .
Minimize the use of traumatic or potentially traumatic procedures such as arterial and venous punctures , intramuscular injections , nasotracheal intubation , etc .
Concomitant use of fibrinolytics , anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs increases the risk of bleeding .
5 . 2 Thrombocytopenia Profound thrombocytopenia has been reported with AGGRASTAT .
Monitor platelet counts beginning about 6 hours after treatment initiation and daily thereafter .
If the platelet count decreases to < 90 , 000 / mm3 , monitor platelet counts to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia .
If thrombocytopenia is confirmed , discontinue AGGRASTAT and heparin .
Previous exposure to a glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb / IIIa receptor antagonist may increase the risk of developing thrombocytopenia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Bleeding is the most commonly reported adverse reaction .

6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
In the PRISM ( Platelet Receptor Inhibition for Ischemic Syndrome Management ) , PRISM - PLUS ( Platelet Receptor Inhibition for Ischemic Syndrome Management — Patients Limited by Unstable Signs and Symptoms ) and RESTORE ( Randomized Efficacy Study of Tirofiban for Outcomes and Restenosis ) trials , 1946 patients received AGGRASTAT in combination with heparin and 2002 patients received AGGRASTAT alone for about 3 days .
Forty - three percent of the population was > 65 years of age and approximately 30 % of patients were female .
In clinical studies with the recommended regimen ( 25 mcg / kg bolus followed by a 0 . 15 mcg / kg / min maintenance infusion ) , AGGRASTAT was administered in combination with aspirin , clopidogrel and heparin or bivalirudin to over 8000 patients for typically ≤ 24 hours .
Approximately 30 % of the population was > 65 years of age and approximately 25 % were female .
Bleeding PRISM - PLUS Regimen The incidences of major and minor bleeding using the TIMI criteria in the PRISM - PLUS study are shown below .
Table 2 TIMI Major and Minor Bleeding in PRISM - PLUS PRISM - PLUS ( NSTE - ACS ) Bleeding ( TIMI Criteria ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] AGGRASTAT [ 3 ] + Heparin ( n = 773 ) Heparin alone ( n = 797 ) Major Bleeding 1 . 4 % 0 . 8 % Minor Bleeding 10 . 5 % 8 . 0 % Transfusions 4 . 0 % 2 . 8 % [ 1 ] Major = Hemoglobin drop of > 5 . 0 g / dL with or without an identified site , intracranial hemorrhage , or cardiac tamponade .

[ 3 ] 0 . 4 mcg / kg / min initial infusion ; 0 . 10 mcg / kg / min maintenance infusion .
The incidence rates of TIMI major bleeding in patients undergoing percutaneous procedures in PRISM - PLUS are shown below .
Table 3 TIMI Major Bleeding Associated with Percutaneous Procedures in PRISM - PLUS AGGRASTAT + Heparin Heparin alone N % N % Prior to Procedures 773 0 . 3 797 0 . 1 Following Angiography 697 1 . 3 708 0 . 7 Following PTCA 239 2 . 5 236 2 . 2 The incidence rates of TIMI major bleeding in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) in PRISM - PLUS within one day of discontinuation of AGGRASTAT were 17 % on AGGRASTAT plus heparin ( N = 29 ) and 35 % on heparin alone ( N = 31 ) .
Recommended ( “ High - Dose Bolus ” ) Regimen Rates of major bleeds ( including any intracranial , intraocular or retroperitoneal hemorrhage , clinically overt signs of hemorrhage associated with a drop in hemoglobin of > 3 g / dL or any drop in hemoglobin by 4 g / dL , bleeding requiring transfusion of ≥ 2 U blood products , bleeding directly resulting in death within 7 days or hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention ) were consistent with the rates observed in subjects administered the PRISM - PLUS regimen of AGGRASTAT .
There was a trend toward greater bleeding in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patients treated with fibrinolytics prior to administration of AGGRASTAT using the recommended regimen during rescue PCI .
Non - Bleeding The incidences of non - bleeding adverse events that occurred at an incidence of > 1 % and numerically higher than control , regardless of drug relationship , are shown below : Table 4 Non - bleeding Adverse Reactions in PRISM - PLUS AGGRASTAT + Heparin ( N = 1953 ) % Heparin alone ( N = 1887 ) % Body as a Whole Edema / swelling 2 1 Pain , pelvic 6 5 Reaction , vasovagal 2 1 Cardiovascular System Bradycardia 4 3 Dissection , coronary artery 5 4 Musculoskeletal System Pain , leg 3 2 Nervous System / Psychiatric Dizziness 3 2 Skin and Skin Appendage Sweating 2 1 Thrombocytopenia Patients treated with AGGRASTAT plus heparin , were more likely to experience decreases in platelet counts than were those on heparin alone .
These decreases were reversible upon discontinuation of AGGRASTAT .
The percentage of patients with a decrease of platelets to < 90 , 000 / mm3 was 1 . 5 % , compared with 0 . 6 % in the patients who received heparin alone .
The percentage of patients with a decrease of platelets to < 50 , 000 / mm3 was 0 . 3 % , compared with 0 . 1 % of the patients who received heparin alone .
6 . 2 Post - Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of AGGRASTAT .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the drug exposure .
Hypersensitivity : Severe allergic reactions including anaphylactic reactions have occurred during the first day of AGGRASTAT infusion , during initial treatment , and during readministration of AGGRASTAT .
Some cases have been associated with severe thrombocytopenia ( platelet counts < 10 , 000 / mm3 ) .
No information is available on the formation of antibodies to tirofiban .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of fibrinolytics , anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs increases the risk of bleeding .
• Coadministration of fibrinolytics , anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents , increases the risk of bleeding .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Renal Insufficiency : Reduce the dose in patients with severe renal insufficiency .
( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary While published data cannot definitively establish the absence of risk , available published case reports have not established an association with tirofiban use during pregnancy and major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Untreated myocardial infarction can be fatal to the pregnant woman and fetus ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Studies with tirofiban HCl at intravenous doses up to 5 mg / kg / day ( about 5 and 13 times the maximum recommended daily human dose for rat and rabbit , respectively , when compared on a body surface area basis ) have revealed no harm to the fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4 % and 15 – 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Myocardial infarction is a medical emergency in pregnancy which can be fatal to the pregnant woman and fetus if left untreated .
Data Animal Data There was no evidence of maternal or developmental toxicity in any of the studies in Table 5 .
Table 5 Developmental Toxicity StudiesType of Study Species Dose / Exposure [ 1 ] Duration / Timing Exposure ( 1 ) Range - finding Rat ( N = 30 ) 1 , 2 , 5 mg / kg / day IV ( N = 10 per group ) Once daily from GD 6 through LD 20 ( 2 ) Developmental Toxicity Rat ( N = 66 ) 1 , 2 , 5 mg / kg / day IV ( N = 22 per group ) Once daily from GD 6 through GD 20 ( 3 ) Developmental Toxicity with Postweaning Evaluation Rat ( N = 66 ) 1 , 2 , 5 mg / kg / day IV ( N = 22 per group ) Once daily from GD 6 through LD 20 ( 4 ) Range - finding ( non - pregnant ) Rabbit ( N = 21 ) 1 , 2 , 5 mg / kg / day IV ( N = 7 per group ) Once daily for 14 days ( 5 ) Range - finding ( pregnant ) Rabbit ( N = 30 ) 1 , 2 , 5 mg / kg / day IV ( N = 10 per group ) Once daily from GD 7 through GD 20 ( 6 ) Developmental Toxicity Rabbit ( N = 60 ) 1 , 2 , 5 mg / kg / day ( N = 20 per group ) IV Once daily from GD 7 through GD 20 [ 1 ] 5 mg / kg / day is ~ 5 and 13 times the maximum recommended daily human dose for rat and rabbit , respectively , when compared on a body surface area basis .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data on the presence of tirofiban in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant , or the effects of the drug on human milk production .
However , tirofiban is present in rat milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for AGGRASTAT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from AGGRASTAT or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in controlled clinical studies of AGGRASTAT , 43 % were 65 years and over , while 12 % were 75 years and over .
With respect to efficacy , the effect of AGGRASTAT in the elderly ( ≥ 65 years ) appeared similar to that seen in younger patients ( < 65 years ) .
Elderly patients receiving AGGRASTAT with heparin or heparin alone had a higher incidence of bleeding complications than did younger patients , but the incremental risk of bleeding in patients treated with AGGRASTAT in combination with heparin compared to the risk in patients treated with heparin alone was similar regardless of age .
No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly population [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Insufficiency Patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency have decreased plasma clearance of AGGRASTAT .
Reduce the dosage of AGGRASTAT in patients with severe renal insufficiency [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Safety and efficacy of AGGRASTAT has not been established in patients on hemodialysis .
10 OVERDOSAGE In clinical trials , inadvertent overdosage with AGGRASTAT occurred in doses up to 2 times the recommended dose for initial infusion doses .
Inadvertent overdosage occurred in doses up to 9 . 8 times the 0 . 15 mcg / kg / min maintenance infusion rate .
The most frequently reported manifestation of overdosage was bleeding , primarily minor mucocutaneous bleeding events and minor bleeding at the sites of cardiac catheterization [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Overdosage of AGGRASTAT should be treated by assessment of the patient ’ s clinical condition and cessation or adjustment of the drug infusion as appropriate .
AGGRASTAT can be removed by hemodialysis .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action AGGRASTAT is a reversible antagonist of fibrinogen binding to the GP IIb / IIIa receptor , the major platelet surface receptor involved in platelet aggregation .
When administered intravenously , AGGRASTAT inhibits ex vivo platelet aggregation in a dose - and concentration - dependent manner .
When given according to the PRISM - PLUS regimen of 0 . 4 mcg / kg / min over 30 minutes followed by a 0 . 1 mcg / kg / min maintenance infusion , > 90 % inhibition of platelet aggregation is attained by the end of the 30 - minute infusion .
When given according to the recommended regimen of 25 mcg / kg followed by a 0 . 15 mcg / kg / min maintenance infusion , > 90 % inhibition of platelet aggregation is attained within 10 minutes .
Platelet aggregation inhibition is reversible following cessation of the infusion of AGGRASTAT .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics AGGRASTAT inhibits platelet function , as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit ex vivo adenosine phosphate ( ADP ) - induced platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time in healthy subjects and patients with coronary artery disease .
The time course of inhibition parallels the plasma concentration profile of the drug .
Following discontinuation of an infusion of AGGRASTAT 0 . 10 mcg / kg / min , ex vivo platelet aggregation returns to near baseline in 4 to 8 hours in approximately 90 % of patients with coronary artery disease .
The addition of heparin to this regimen does not significantly alter the percentage of subjects with > 70 % inhibition of platelet aggregation ( IPA ) , but does increase the average bleeding time , as well as the number of patients with bleeding times prolonged to > 30 minutes .
Similar platelet aggregation recovery rates are observed following discontinuation of a 0 . 15 mcg / kg / min infusion .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Tirofiban has a half - life of approximately 2 hours .
It is cleared from the plasma largely by renal excretion , with about 65 % of an administered dose appearing in urine and about 25 % in feces , both largely as unchanged tirofiban .
Metabolism appears to be limited .
Tirofiban is not highly bound to plasma proteins and protein binding is concentration independent over the range of 0 . 01 to 25 mcg / mL .
The unbound fraction in human plasma is 35 % .
The steady state volume of distribution of tirofiban ranges from 22 to 42 liters .
In healthy subjects , the plasma clearance of tirofiban ranges from 213 to 314 mL / min .
Renal clearance accounts for 39 to 69 % of plasma clearance .
Specific Populations There is no effect on clearance of tirofiban by sex , race , age , or hepatic impairment .
Renal Insufficiency Plasma clearance of tirofiban is decreased about 40 % in subjects with creatinine clearance < 60 mL / min and > 50 % in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min , including patients requiring hemodialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Tirofiban is removed by hemodialysis .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of AGGRASTAT has not been evaluated .
Tirofiban HCl was negative in the in vitro microbial mutagenesis and V - 79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assays .
In addition , there was no evidence of direct genotoxicity in the in vitro alkaline elution and in vitro chromosomal aberration assays .
There was no induction of chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells of male mice after the administration of intravenous doses up to 5 mg tirofiban / kg ( about 3 times the maximum recommended daily human dose when compared on a body surface area basis ) .
Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies with male and female rats given intravenous doses of tirofiban up to 5 mg / kg / day ( about 5 times the maximum recommended daily human dose when compared on a body surface area basis ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two large - scale clinical studies established the efficacy of AGGRASTAT in the treatment of patients with NSTE - ACS ( unstable angina / non - ST elevation MI ) .
The two studies examined AGGRASTAT alone and added to heparin , prior to and after percutaneous coronary revascularization ( if indicated ) ( PRISM - PLUS ) and in comparison to heparin in a similar population ( PRISM ) .
These trials are discussed in detail below .
PRISM - PLUS ( Platelet Receptor Inhibition for Ischemic Syndrome Management — Patients Limited by Unstable Signs and Symptoms ) In the double - blind PRISM - PLUS trial , 1570 patients with documented NSTE - ACS within 12 hours of entry into the study were randomized to AGGRASTAT ( 30 minute initial infusion of 0 . 4 mcg / kg / min followed by a maintenance infusion of 0 . 10 mcg / kg / min ) in combination with heparin ( bolus of 5 , 000 U followed by an infusion of 1 , 000 U / h titrated to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) of approximately 2 times control ) or to heparin alone .
All patients received concomitant aspirin unless contraindicated .
Patients who were medically managed or who underwent revascularization procedures were studied .
Patients underwent 48 hours of medical stabilization on study drug therapy , and they were to undergo angiography before 96 hours ( and , if indicated , angioplasty / atherectomy , while continuing on AGGRASTAT and heparin for 12 - 24 hours after the procedure ) .
AGGRASTAT and heparin could be continued for up to 108 hours .
Exclusions included contraindications to anticoagulation , decompensated heart failure , platelet count < 150 , 000 / mm3 , and serum creatinine > 2 . 5 mg / dL .
The mean age of the population was 63 years ; 32 % of patients were female and approximately half of the population presented with non - ST elevation myocardial infarction .
On average , patients received AGGRASTAT for 71 hours .
A third group of patients was initially randomized to AGGRASTAT alone ( no heparin ) .
This arm was stopped when the group was found , at an interim look , to have greater mortality than the other two groups .
The primary endpoint of the study was a composite of refractory ischemia , new MI and death within 7 days .
There was a 32 % risk reduction in the overall composite primary endpoint .
The components of the composite were examined separately and the results are shown in Table 6 .
Note that the sum of the individual components may be greater than the composite ( if a patient experiences multiple component events only one event counts towards the composite ) .
Table 6 Primary Outcomes at 7 days in PRISM - PLUSEndpoint AGGRASTAT + Heparin ( n = 773 ) Heparin ( n = 797 ) Risk Reduction p - value Death , new MI , and refractory ischemia at 7 days 12 . 9 % 17 . 9 % 32 % 0 . 004 Death 1 . 9 % 1 . 9 % --- --- MI 3 . 9 % 7 . 0 % 47 % 0 . 006 Refractory Ischemia 9 . 3 % 12 . 7 % 30 % 0 . 023 The benefit seen at 7 days was maintained over time .
The risk reduction in the composite endpoint at 30 days and 6 months is shown in the Kaplan - Meier curve below .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 1 .
Time to first event of death , new MI , or refractory ischemia in PRISM - PLUS An analysis of the results by sex suggests that women who are medically managed or who undergo subsequent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) / atherectomy may receive less benefit from AGGRASTAT ( 95 % confidence limits for relative risk of 0 . 61 - 1 . 74 ) than do men ( 0 . 43 - 0 . 89 ) ( p = 0 . 11 ) .
This difference may be a true treatment difference , the effect of other differences in these subgroups , or a chance occurrence .
Approximately 90 % of patients in the PRISM - PLUS study underwent coronary angiography and 30 % underwent angioplasty / atherectomy during the first 30 days of the study .
The majority of these patients continued on study drug throughout these procedures .
AGGRASTAT was continued for 12 - 24 hours ( average 15 hours ) after angioplasty / atherectomy .
The effects of AGGRASTAT at Day 30 did not appear to differ among sub - populations that did or did not receive PTCA or CABG , both prior to and after the procedure .
PRISM ( Platelet Receptor Inhibition for Ischemic Syndrome Management ) In the PRISM study , a randomized , parallel , double - blind study , 3232 patients with NSTE - ACS intended to be managed without coronary intervention were randomized to AGGRASTAT ( initial dose of 0 . 6 mcg / kg / min for 30 minutes followed by 0 . 15 mcg / kg / min for 47 . 5 hours ) or heparin ( 5000 - unit intravenous bolus followed by an infusion of 1000 U / h for 48 hours ) .
The mean age of the population was 62 years ; 32 % of the population was female and 25 % had non - ST elevation MI on presentation .
Thirty percent had no ECG evidence of cardiac ischemia .
Exclusion criteria were similar to PRISM - PLUS .
The primary endpoint was the composite endpoint of refractory ischemia , MI or death at the end of the 48 - hour drug infusion .
The results are shown in Table 7 .
Table 7 Primary Outcomes in PRISM – Cardiac Ischemia EventsComposite Endpoint ( death , MI , or refractory ischemia ) AGGRASTAT ( n = 1616 ) Heparin ( n = 1616 ) Risk Reduction p - value 2 Days ( end of drug infusion ) 3 . 8 % 5 . 6 % 33 % 0 . 015 7 Days 10 . 3 % 11 . 3 % 10 % 0 . 33 In the PRISM study , no adverse effect of AGGRASTAT on mortality at either 7 or 30 days was detected .
This result is different from that in the PRISM - PLUS study , where the arm that included AGGRASTAT without heparin ( N = 345 ) was dropped at an interim analysis by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee for increased mortality at 7 days .
