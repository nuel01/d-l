1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE HESPAN ® is indicated in the treatment of hypovolemia when plasma volume expansion is desired in settings where adequate alternative treatment is unavailable .
It is not a substitute for blood or plasma .
The adjunctive use of HESPAN ® in leukapheresis has also been shown to be safe and efficacious in improving the harvesting and increasing the yield of granulocytes by centrifugal means .
• HESPAN ® is a hetastarch indicated for treatment of hypovolemia when plasma volume expansion is desired in settings where adequate alternative treatment is unavailable .
• HESPAN ® in leukapheresis has shown to be safe and efficacious in improving the harvesting and increasing the yield of granulocytes by centrifugal means .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage for Acute Use in Plasma Volume Expansion HESPAN ® is administered by intravenous infusion only .
Total dosage and rate of infusion depend upon the amount of blood or plasma lost and the resultant hemoconcentration .
For intravenous use only .
Recommended Dosage Dose Adults ( 2 . 1 ) 500 to 1000 mL Leukapheresis ( 2 . 2 ) 250 to 700 mL of HESPAN ® ( 6 % hetastarch in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection ) with citrate anticoagulant is added to the input line of the centrifugation apparatus .
2 . 1 Adults The amount usually administered is 500 to 1000 mL .
Doses of more than 1500 mL per day for the typical 70 kg patient ( approximately 20 mL per kg of body weight ) are usually not required .
Higher doses have been reported in postoperative and trauma patients where severe blood loss has occurred [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
2 . 2 Leukapheresis 250 to 700 mL of HESPAN ® ( 6 % hetastarch in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection ) with citrate anticoagulant is administered by aseptic addition to the input line of the centrifugation apparatus at a ratio of 1 : 8 to 1 : 13 to venous whole blood .
The HESPAN ® and citrate should be thoroughly mixed to assure effective anticoagulation of blood as it flows through the leukapheresis machine .
2 . 3 Direction for use for HESPAN ® • Do not use plastic container in series connection .
If administration is controlled by a pumping device , care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result .
If administration is not controlled by a pumping device , refrain from applying excessive pressure ( > 300 mmHg ) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting .
Such handling could result in breakage of the container .
• Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact .
• Intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment .
It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours .
• Withdraw or expel all air from the bag through the medication port prior to infusion if administration is by pressure infusion .
• For single use only .
Discard unused portion .
CAUTION : Before administering to the patient , review these directions : Visual Inspection • Do not remove the plastic infusion container from its overwrap until immediately before use .
• Inspect each container .
Read the label .
Ensure solution is the one ordered and is within the expiration date .
• Invert container and carefully inspect the solution in good light for cloudiness , haze , or particulate matter .
• Any container which is suspect should not be used .
To Open • Tear overwrap down at notch and remove solution container .
• Check for minute leaks by squeezing solution container firmly .
• If any leaks are found , discard solution as sterility may be impaired .
Preparation for Administration • Remove plastic protector from sterile set port at bottom of container .
• Attach administration set .
Refer to complete directions accompanying set .
When stored at room temperature , HESPAN ® admixtures of 500 - 560 mL with citrate concentrations up to 2 . 5 % were compatible for 24 hours .
The safety and compatibility of additives other than citrate have not been established .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Single - use container : • 30 g hetastarch in 500 mL of 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection .
• 30 g hetastarch in 500 mL 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Do not use HES products , including HESPAN ® , unless adequate alternative treatment is unavailable .
• Do not use HES products , including HESPAN ® , unless adequate alternative treatment is unavailable .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Avoid use in patients with pre - existing renal dysfunction ( 5 . 1 ) • Increased risk of mortality and acute kidney injury ( AKI ) in critically ill patients , including patients with sepsis ; surgical patients ; and blunt trauma patients ( 5 . 1 ) • Discontinue use of HESPAN ® at the first sign of renal injury ( 5 . 1 ) • Continue to monitor renal function for at least 90 days as use of RRT has been reported up to 90 days after administration of HES products , including HESPAN ® ( 5 . 1 ) • HESPAN ® is not recommended for use as a cardiac bypass pump prime , while the patient is on cardiopulmonary bypass , or in the immediate period after the pump has been discontinued because of the risk of increasing coagulation abnormalities and bleeding in patients whose coagulation status is already impaired .
Discontinue use of HESPAN ® at first sign of coagulopathy ( 5 . 2 ) • Monitor liver function in patients receiving HES products , including HESPAN ® ( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Mortality and Renal Dysfunction • Critically ill patients , including patients with sepsis , are at increased risk of mortality and acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , including need for renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) .
• Surgery patients are at increased risk of mortality and AKI • Blunt trauma patients are at increased risk of mortality and AKI .
• Avoid use in patients with pre - existing renal dysfunction • Discontinue use of HESPAN ® at the first sign of renal injury • Continue to monitor renal function for at least 90 days as use of RRT has been reported up to 90 days after administration of HES products , including HESPAN ® 5 . 2 Coagulopathy • HESPAN ® is not recommended for use as a cardiac bypass pump prime , while the patient is on cardiopulmonary bypass , or in the immediate period after the pump has been discontinued because of the risk of increasing coagulation abnormalities and bleeding in patients whose coagulation status is already impaired .
Monitor the coagulation status of surgery patients , as excess bleeding has been reported with HES solutions in this population .
Discontinue use of HESPAN ® at first sign of coagulopathy1 - 2 HESPAN ® has not been adequately evaluated to establish its safety in uses over extended periods other than leukapheresis .
HESPAN ® has been associated with coagulation abnormalities in conjunction with an acquired , reversible von Willebrand ’ s - like syndrome and / or Factor Vlll deficiency when used over a period of days .
Replacement therapy should be considered if a severe Factor Vlll deficiency is identified .
If a coagulopathy develops , it may take several days to resolve .
Certain conditions may affect the safe use of HESPAN ® on a chronic basis .
For example , in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage where HESPAN ® is used repeatedly over a period of days for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm , significant clinical bleeding may occur .
Intracranial bleeding resulting in death has been reported . 3 Slight declines in platelet counts and hemoglobin levels have been observed in donors undergoing repeated leukapheresis procedures using HESPAN ® due to the volume expanding effects of hetastarch and to the collection of platelets and erythrocytes .
Hemoglobin levels usually return to normal within 24 hours .
Hemodilution by HESPAN ® may also result in 24 hour declines of total protein , albumin , calcium , and fibrinogen levels .
Regular and frequent clinical evaluation and complete blood counts ( CBC ) are necessary for proper monitoring of HESPAN ® use during leukapheresis .
If the frequency of leukapheresis is to exceed the guidelines for whole blood donation , you may wish to consider the following additional tests : total leukocyte and platelet counts , leukocyte differential count , hemoglobin and hematocrit , prothrombin time ( PT ) , and partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) .
5 . 3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Life threatening anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions including death have been rarely reported with HESPAN ® .
Patients may develop hypersensitivity reaction to corn starch from which this product is made .
If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs , administration of the drug should be discontinued immediately and the appropriate treatment and supportive measures should be undertaken until symptoms have resolved .
5 . 4 Circulatory Overload HESPAN ® has not been adequately evaluated to establish its safety in situations other than treatment of hypovolemia in elective surgery .
Large volumes of HESPAN ® may transiently alter the coagulation mechanism due to hemodilution and a direct inhibitory action on Factor Vlll .
Administration of volumes of HESPAN ® that are greater than 25 % of the blood volume in less than 24 hours may cause significant hemodilution reflected by lower hematocrit and plasma protein values .
Administration of packed red cells , platelets , or fresh frozen plasma should be considered if clinically indicated .
When using HESPAN ® for plasma volume expansion , caution should be taken to avoid excessive hemodilution and circulatory overload especially in those patients at risk for developing congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema .
HESPAN ® is primarily excreted via the kidneys so caution should be exercised in patients who have impaired renal function .
Although the risk of circulatory overload is largely dependent on the clinical circumstances , use of doses higher than 20 mL / kg / 24 h will increase the risk significantly .
Increased risk of coagulation abnormalities and bleeding is also associated with higher doses .
Monitor patients ' vital signs and hemoglobin , hematocrit , platelet count , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time .
5 . 5 Liver Function Test • Monitor liver function in patients receiving HES products , including HESPAN ® 5 . 6 Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions Bilirubin Levels Indirect bilirubin levels of 8 . 3 mg / L ( normal 0 . 0 - 7 . 0 mg / L ) have been reported in 2 out of 20 normal subjects who received multiple infusions of HESPAN ® ( 6 % hetastarch in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection ) .
Total bilirubin was within normal limits at all times ; indirect bilirubin returned to normal by 96 hours following the final infusion .
The significance , if any , of these elevations is not known ; however , caution should be observed before administering HESPAN ® to patients with a history of liver disease .
Serum Amylase Levels Elevated serum amylase levels may be observed temporarily following administration of HESPAN ® although no association with pancreatitis has been demonstrated .
Serum amylase levels cannot be used to assess or to evaluate for pancreatitis for 3 - 5 days after administration of HESPAN ® .
Elevated serum amylase levels persist for longer periods of time in patients with renal impairment .
Hetastarch has not been shown to increase serum lipase .
Hemodialysis HESPAN ® is not eliminated by hemodialysis .
The utility of other extracorporeal elimination techniques has not been evaluated .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious adverse reactions reported in postmarket clinical trials include increased mortality and AKI ( including need for RRT ) in critically ill subjects , including subjects with sepsis , and surgical subjects .
Clinical trials have also shown increased mortality and AKI in blunt trauma subjects .
Increased coagulopathy was reported in surgical subjects .
Most common adverse reactions are hypersensitivity , coagulopathy , hemodilution , circulatory overload and metabolic acidosis .
• Most common adverse reactions are hypersensitivity , coagulopathy , hemodilution , circulatory overload and metabolic acidosis .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
( Note : All of the studies listed below used licensed HES products except for reference 4 . )
A randomized controlled trial ( N = 804 ) in severe sepsis patients using HES product ( not approved in the U . S . ) reported increased mortality ( relative risk , 1 . 17 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 01 to 1 . 36 ; p = 0 . 03 ) and RRT ( relative risk , 1 . 35 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 01 to 1 . 80 ; p = 0 . 04 ) in the HES treatment arm . 4 Another randomized controlled trial ( N = 196 ) using different HES in severe sepsis patients reported no difference in mortality ( relative risk , 1 . 20 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 83 to 1 . 74 ; p = 0 . 33 ) and a trend for RRT ( relative risk , 1 . 83 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 93 to 3 . 59 ; p = 0 . 06 ) in HES patients . 5 A randomized controlled trial ( N = 7000 ) using different HES in a heterogeneous patient population consisting of critically ill adult patients admitted to the ICU reported no difference in mortality ( relative risk , 1 . 06 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 96 to 1 . 18 ; p = 0 . 26 ) but increased use of RRT ( relative risk , 1 . 21 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 00 to 1 . 45 ; p = 0 . 04 ) in HES patients . 6 In a retrospective study of adult patients ( N = 1442 ) undergoing pulmonary or esophageal surgery who were prophylactically fluid restricted during the procedure , 74 developed AKI ( 5 . 1 % ) within the first 72 hours postoperatively .
Fluid restriction neither increased nor was a risk factor for AKI .
AKI occurred more often when HES products were administered to patients with decreased renal function or having > 2 risk factors with normal renal function , whereas restriction of crystalloid was unrelated to AKI , regardless of preoperative renal function . 12 In a retrospective case series of high - risk adult vascular surgery patients ( N = 796 ) receiving fluid therapy during a vascular surgery procedure , logistic regression analysis using prespecified confounding variables or suspected risk factors for AKI showed that intraoperative administration of an HES product was associated with increased likelihood of 30 - day mortality and need for RRT , compared with use of crystalloids alone . 13 In a retrospective study of adult subjects undergoing elective noncardiac surgery , patients ( N = 14 , 680 ) receiving an HES product and crystalloid were propensity - matched with patients ( N = 14 , 680 ) receiving only crystalloid .
After controlling for potential confounding variables , odds of experiencing AKI of severe intensity with HES was 21 % greater than with crystalloid alone .
In addition , AKI risk increased as a function of HES volume . 14 In a prospective observational study assessing the impact of HES products on recipient renal graft outcomes in brain - dead organ donors , data were obtained on 986 kidneys transplanted from 529 donors .
Kidneys from donors who received HES had a higher rate of delayed graft function in recipient subjects ( 41 % versus 31 % ) .
After accounting for the propensity of donors to receive HES products , HES product administration was independently associated with an increased risk of delayed graft function in recipients . A dose response relationship also was evident . 15 In a randomized , controlled trial of adult subjects ( N = 33 ) undergoing elective cystectomy comparing an HES product versus lactated Ringer ’ s , administration of HES reduced clot strength ( Maximum Amplitude ; p < 0 . 001 ) and increased blinded evaluation of perioperative blood loss by more than 50 % ( 2181 mL versus 1370 mL , respectively ; p = 0 . 04 ) .
There was no significant between - group difference with respect to frequency of reoperation or length of hospital stay . 16 In a prospective , sequential , observational study in adult subjects undergoing open heart surgery in association with cardiopulmonary bypass , fluid therapy using only an HES product ( 2004 - 2006 , N = 2137 ) , 4 % gelatin ( 2006 - 2008 , N = 2324 ) and crystalloids ( N = 2017 , 2008 - 2010 ) led to increased need for renal replacement therapy after HES and gelatin , compared with crystalloid .
Propensity score stratification confirmed greater use of RRT in the HES and gelatin periods compared to the crystalloid period .
Fluid intake was higher in the crystalloid group only during the first 20 hours . 17 In a retrospective observational study , 606 adult patients underwent open heart surgery in association with cardiopulmonary bypass .
Until July 2013 they received an HES product ( N = 247 ) both as pump prime ( 1500 mL ) and intraoperative fluid replacement ( 1000 mL ) , but only crystalloid ( N = 359 ) from August 2013 onward .
The frequency ( percent ) of postoperative AKI was higher in patients receiving HES ( N = 53 ; 21 . 5 % ) than those receiving crystalloid ( N = 34 ; 9 . 5 % ) .
Surgical revision for rebleeding also was higher for HES ( N = 11 ; 4 . 6 % ) than for crystalloid ( N = 5 ; 1 . 4 % ) . 18 In a meta - analysis of RCTs ( n = 15 ) in adult subjects ( N = 4409 ) undergoing surgery who received an HES product , significantly more HES subjects ( 83 / 2157 ; 3 . 8 % ) than controls ( 56 / 2252 ; 2 . 5 % ) underwent RRT ( relative risk , 1 . 44 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 04 , 2 . 01 ) . 19 In a retrospective observational study of adult blunt and penetrating trauma patients , use of an HES product was a significant independent predictor of AKI after blunt trauma , but not penetrating trauma , in multiple logistic regression analysis .
In separate logistic regression models , HES also was a significant predictor of mortality after blunt trauma but not penetrating trauma . 20 In a retrospective observational study of severely injured adult blunt ( 89 % ) and penetrating ( 11 % ) trauma patients ( N = 413 ) admitted to the ICU , 103 patients developed AKI within the first week of ICU admission .
AKI was associated with increased 30 - day ( 17 . 5 % versus 5 . 8 % , AKI versus non - AKI cohorts , respectively ) and 1 - year mortality ( 26 . 2 % versus 7 . 1 % ) .
Univariate and multivariable regression analyses of prespecified risk factors for AKI found that volume loading using an HES product was independently associated with postinjury AKI within the first 24 hours . 21 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily post - approval from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causal relationship to product exposure .
The following adverse reactions have been identified and reported during the post - approval use of HES products : Hypersensitivity reactions including death , life - threatening anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions , cardiac arrest , ventricular fibrillation , severe hypotension , non - cardiac pulmonary edema , laryngeal edema , bronchospasm , angioedema , wheezing , restlessness , tachypnea , stridor , fever , chest pain , bradycardia , tachycardia , shortness of breath , chills , urticaria , pruritus , facial and periorbital edema , coughing , sneezing , flushing , erythema multiforme , and rash [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Cardiovascular reactions including circulatory overload , congestive heart failure , and pulmonary edema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Hematologic reactions including intracranial bleeding , bleeding and / or anemia due to hemodilution [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] and / or Factor Vlll deficiency , acquired von Willebrand ’ s - like syndrome , and coagulopathy including rare cases of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and hemolysis .
Metabolic reactions including metabolic acidosis .
Other reactions including vomiting , peripheral edema of the lower extremities , submaxillary and parotid glandular enlargement , mild influenza - like symptoms , headaches , and muscle pains .
Hydroxyethyl starch - associated pruritus has been reported in some patients with deposits of hydroxyethyl starch in peripheral nerves .

( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Hetastarch has been shown to have an embryocidal effect on New Zealand rabbits when given intravenously over the entire organogenesis period in a daily dose 1 / 2 times the maximum recommended therapeutic human dose ( 1500 mL ) and on BD rats when given intraperitoneally , from the 16 th to the 21 st day of pregnancy , in a daily dose 2 . 3 times the maximum recommended therapeutic human dose .
When hetastarch was administered to New Zealand rabbits , BD rats , and swiss mice with intravenous daily doses of 2 times , 1 / 3 times , and 1 times the maximum recommended therapeutic human dose respectively over several days during the period of gestation , no evidence of teratogenicity was evident .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
HESPAN ® should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether hetastarch is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when HESPAN ® is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of hetastarch in pediatric patients have not been established .
Adequate , well - controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of HESPAN ® in pediatric patients have not been conducted .
11 DESCRIPTION HESPAN ® ( 6 % hetastarch in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection ) is a sterile , nonpyrogenic solution for intravenous administration .
Each 100 mL contains : Hetastarch .................................................. 6 g Sodium Chloride , USP ...............................
0 . 9 g Water for Injection , USP ............................. qs pH adjusted with Sodium Hydroxide , NF if necessary Concentration of Electrolytes ( mEq / L ) : Sodium 154 , Chloride 154 pH : approximately 5 . 9 with negligible buffering capacity Calc .
Osmolarity : approximately 309 mOsM Hetastarch is a synthetic colloid derived from a waxy starch composed almost entirely of amylopectin .
Hydroxyethyl ether groups are introduced into the glucose units of the starch , and the resultant material is hydrolyzed to yield a product with a molecular weight suitable for use as a plasma volume expander and erythrocyte sedimenting agent .
The molar substitution is approximately 0 . 75 which means hetastarch has an average of approximately 75 hydroxyethyl groups for every 100 glucose units .
The weight average molecular weight is approximately 600 , 000 with a range of 450 , 000 to 800 , 000 and with at least 80 % of the polymers falling within the range of 20 , 000 to 2 , 600 , 000 .
Hydroxyethyl groups are attached by ether linkage primarily at C - 2 of the glucose unit and to a lesser extent at C - 3 and C - 6 .
The polymer resembles glycogen , and the polymerized D - glucose units are joined primarily by α - 1 , 4 linkages with occasional α - 1 , 6 branching linkages .
The chemical name for hetastarch is hydroxyethyl starch .
The structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Amylopectin derivative in which R2 and R3 are H or CH2CH2OH and R6 is H , CH2CH2OH , or a branching point in the starch polymer connected through an α - 1 , 6 link to additional D - glucopyranosyl units .
HESPAN ® is a clear , pale yellow to amber solution .
Exposure to prolonged adverse storage conditions may result in a change to a turbid deep brown or the formation of a crystalline precipitate .
Do not use the solution if these conditions are evident .
Not made with natural rubber latex , PVC or DEHP .
The plastic container is made from a multi - layered film specifically developed for parenteral drugs .
It contains no plasticizers and exhibits virtually no leachables .
The solution contact layer is a rubberized copolymer of ethylene and propylene .
The container is nontoxic and biologically inert .
The container - solution unit is a closed system and is not dependent upon entry of external air during administration .
The container is overwrapped to provide protection from the physical environment and to provide an additional moisture barrier when necessary .
The closure system has two ports ; the one for the administration set has a tamper evident plastic protector .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The plasma volume expansion produced by HESPAN ® approximates that of 5 % Albumin ( Human ) .
Intravenous infusion of HESPAN ® results in expansion of plasma volume .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics HESPAN ® results in expansion of plasma volume that decreases over the succeeding 24 to 36 hours .
The degree of plasma volume expansion and improvement in hemodynamic state depend upon the patient ’ s intravascular status .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Hetastarch molecules below 50 , 000 molecular weight are rapidly eliminated by renal excretion .
A single dose of approximately 500 mL of HESPAN ® ( approximately 30 g ) results in elimination in the urine of approximately 33 % of the dose within 24 hours .
This is a variable process but generally results in an intravascular hetastarch concentration of less than 10 % of the total dose injected by two weeks .
A study of the biliary excretion of HESPAN ® in 10 healthy males accounted for less than 1 % of the dose over a 14 day period .
The hydroxyethyl group is not cleaved by the body but remains intact and attached to glucose units when excreted .
Significant quantities of glucose are not produced as hydroxyethylation prevents complete metabolism of the smaller polymers .
The addition of hetastarch to whole blood increases the erythrocyte sedimentation rate .
Therefore , HESPAN ® is used to improve the efficiency of granulocyte collection by centrifugal means .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies of animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hetastarch .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Surgical Patients Comparative Studies In randomized , controlled , comparative studies of HESPAN ® ( 6 % hetastarch in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection ) ( n = 92 ) and Albumin ( n = 85 ) in surgical patients , no patient in either treatment group had a bleeding complication and no significant difference was found in the amount of blood loss between the treatment groups . 7 - 10 Pediatric Postoperative Volume Expander Study In one small double - blind study , 47 infants , children , and adolescents ( ages 1 year to 15 . 5 years ) scheduled for repair of congenital heart disease with moderate hypothermia were randomized to receive either HESPAN ® or Albumin as a postoperative volume expander during the first 24 hours after surgery .
Thirty - eight children required colloid replacement therapy , of which 20 children received HESPAN ® .
No differences were found in the coagulation parameters or in the amount of replacement fluids required in the children receiving 20 mL / kg or less of either colloid replacement therapy .
In children who received greater than 20 mL / kg of HESPAN ® , an increase in prothrombin time was demonstrated ( p = 0 . 006 ) . 11 There were no neonates included in this study [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Adult Critically Ill Studies Three randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) followed critically ill adult patients treated with different HES products for 90 days .
One trial ( N = 804 ) in severe sepsis patients using HES product ( not approved in the U . S . ) reported increased mortality ( relative risk , 1 . 17 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 01 to 1 . 36 ; p = 0 . 03 ) and RRT ( relative risk , 1 . 35 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 01 to 1 . 80 ; p = 0 . 04 ) in the HES treatment arm . 4 Another trial ( N = 196 ) using different HES in severe sepsis patients reported no difference in mortality ( relative risk , 1 . 20 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 83 to 1 . 74 ; p = 0 . 33 ) and a trend for RRT ( relative risk , 1 . 83 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 93 to 3 . 59 ; p = 0 . 06 ) in HES patients . 5 A third trial ( N = 7000 ) using different HES in a heterogeneous patient population consisting of critically ill adult patients admitted to the ICU reported no difference in mortality ( relative risk , 1 . 06 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 96 to 1 . 18 ; p = 0 . 26 ) but increased use of RRT ( relative risk , 1 . 21 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 00 to 1 . 45 ; p = 0 . 04 ) in HES patients . 6 15 REFERENCES • Knutson JE . , et al . , Does Intraoperative Hetastarch Administration Increase Blood Loss and Transfusion Requirements After Cardiac Surgery ?
