WARNING : RISK OF THYROID C - CELL TUMORS • In both male and female rats , tirzepatide causes dose - dependent and treatment - duration - dependent thyroid C - cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures .
It is unknown whether MOUNJARO causes thyroid C - cell tumors , including medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTC ) , in humans as human relevance of tirzepatide - induced rodent thyroid C - cell tumors has not been determined [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
• MOUNJARO is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 ( MEN 2 ) [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of MOUNJARO and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors ( e . g . , a mass in the neck , dysphagia , dyspnea , persistent hoarseness ) .
Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with MOUNJARO [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .

Discontinue promptly if pancreatitis is suspected .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin : Concomitant use with an insulin secretagogue or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia , including severe hypoglycemia .
Reducing dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin may be necessary .
( 5 . 3 ) • Hypersensitivity Reactions : Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported .
Discontinue MOUNJARO if suspected .
( 5 . 4 ) • Acute Kidney Injury : Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions .
( 5 . 5 ) • Severe Gastrointestinal Disease : Use may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions , sometimes severe .
Has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease and is not recommended in these patients .
( 5 . 6 ) • Diabetic Retinopathy Complications in Patients with a History of Diabetic Retinopathy : Has not been studied in patients with non - proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute therapy , proliferative diabetic retinopathy , or diabetic macular edema .
Monitor patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy for progression .
( 5 . 7 ) • Acute Gallbladder Disease : Has occurred in clinical trials .
If cholelithiasis is suspected , gallbladder studies and clinical follow - up are indicated .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Thyroid C - Cell Tumors In both sexes of rats , tirzepatide caused a dose - dependent and treatment - duration - dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C - cell tumors ( adenomas and carcinomas ) in a 2 - year study at clinically relevant plasma exposures [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
It is unknown whether MOUNJARO causes thyroid C - cell tumors , including medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTC ) , in humans as human relevance of tirzepatide - induced rodent thyroid C - cell tumors has not been determined .
MOUNJARO is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2 .
Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of MOUNJARO and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors ( e . g . , a mass in the neck , dysphagia , dyspnea , persistent hoarseness ) .
Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with MOUNJARO .
Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures , due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease .
Significantly elevated serum calcitonin values may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng / L .
If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated , the patient should be further evaluated .
Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated .
5 . 2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis , including fatal and non - fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis , has been observed in patients treated with GLP - 1 receptor agonists .
In clinical studies , 14 events of acute pancreatitis were confirmed by adjudication in 13 MOUNJARO - treated patients ( 0 . 23 patients per 100 years of exposure ) versus 3 events in 3 comparator - treated patients ( 0 . 11 patients per 100 years of exposure ) .
MOUNJARO has not been studied in patients with a prior history of pancreatitis .
It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on MOUNJARO .
After initiation of MOUNJARO , observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis ( including persistent severe abdominal pain , sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting ) .
If pancreatitis is suspected , discontinue MOUNJARO and initiate appropriate management .
5 . 3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Patients receiving MOUNJARO in combination with an insulin secretagogue ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia , including severe hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea ( or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue ) or insulin .
Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia .
5 . 4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with MOUNJARO in clinical trials ( e . g . , urticaria and eczema ) and were sometimes severe .
If hypersensitivity reactions occur , discontinue use of MOUNJARO ; treat promptly per standard of care , and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve .
Do not use in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to tirzepatide or any of the excipients in MOUNJARO [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with GLP - 1 receptor agonists .
Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with a GLP - 1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with MOUNJARO .
5 . 5 Acute Kidney Injury MOUNJARO has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions , which include nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
These events may lead to dehydration , which if severe could cause acute kidney injury .
In patients treated with GLP - 1 receptor agonists , there have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure , which may sometimes require hemodialysis .
Some of these events have been reported in patients without known underlying renal disease .
A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or dehydration .
Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses of MOUNJARO in patients with renal impairment reporting severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions .
5 . 6 Severe Gastrointestinal Disease Use of MOUNJARO has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions , sometimes severe [ see Adverse Reactions 6 . 1 ] .
MOUNJARO has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease , including severe gastroparesis , and is therefore not recommended in these patients .
5 . 7 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications in Patients with a History of Diabetic Retinopathy Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
MOUNJARO has not been studied in patients with non - proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute therapy , proliferative diabetic retinopathy , or diabetic macular edema .
Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy .
5 . 8 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP - 1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing .
In MOUNJARO placebo - controlled clinical trials , acute gallbladder disease ( cholelithiasis , biliary colic , and cholecystectomy ) was reported by 0 . 6 % of MOUNJARO - treated patients and 0 % of placebo - treated patients .
If cholelithiasis is suspected , gallbladder diagnostic studies and appropriate clinical follow - up are indicated .

Common Adverse Reactions Table 1 shows common adverse reactions , not including hypoglycemia , associated with the use of MOUNJARO in the pool of placebo - controlled trials .
These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on MOUNJARO than on placebo and occurred in at least 5 % of patients treated with MOUNJARO .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions in Pool of Placebo - Controlled Trials Reported in ≥ 5 % of MOUNJARO - treated Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Note : Percentages reflect the number of patients who reported at least 1 occurrence of the adverse reaction .
Adverse Reaction Placebo ( N = 235 ) % MOUNJARO 5 mg ( N = 237 ) % MOUNJARO 10 mg ( N = 240 ) % MOUNJARO 15 mg ( N = 241 ) % Nausea 4 12 15 18 Diarrhea 9 12 13 17 Decreased Appetite 1 5 10 11 Vomiting 2 5 5 9 Constipation 1 6 6 7 Dyspepsia 3 8 8 5 Abdominal Pain 4 6 5 5 In the pool of seven clinical trials , the types and frequency of common adverse reactions , not including hypoglycemia , were similar to those listed in Table 1 .
Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of placebo - controlled trials , gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving MOUNJARO than placebo ( placebo 20 . 4 % , MOUNJARO 5 mg 37 . 1 % , MOUNJARO 10 mg 39 . 6 % , MOUNJARO 15 mg 43 . 6 % ) .
More patients receiving MOUNJARO 5 mg ( 3 . 0 % ) , MOUNJARO 10 mg ( 5 . 4 % ) , and MOUNJARO 15 mg ( 6 . 6 % ) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions than patients receiving placebo ( 0 . 4 % ) .
The majority of reports of nausea , vomiting , and / or diarrhea occurred during dose escalation and decreased over time .
The following gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently in MOUNJARO - treated patients than placebo - treated patients ( frequencies listed , respectively , as : placebo ; 5 mg ; 10 mg ; 15 mg ) : eructation ( 0 . 4 % , 3 . 0 % , 2 . 5 % , 3 . 3 % ) , flatulence ( 0 % , 1 . 3 % , 2 . 5 % , 2 . 9 % ) , gastroesophageal reflux disease ( 0 . 4 % , 1 . 7 % , 2 . 5 % , 1 . 7 % ) , abdominal distension ( 0 . 4 % , 0 . 4 % , 2 . 9 % , 0 . 8 % ) .
Other Adverse Reactions Hypoglycemia Table 2 summarizes the incidence of hypoglycemic events in the placebo - controlled trials .
Table 2 : Hypoglycemia Adverse Reactions in Placebo - Controlled Trials in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus * Reflects the study treatment period .
Data include events occurring during 4 weeks of treatment - free safety follow up .
Events after introduction of a new glucose - lowering treatment are excluded .
** Episodes requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate , glucagon , or other resuscitative actions .

In a clinical trial up to 104 weeks of treatment , when administered with a sulfonylurea , hypoglycemia ( glucose level < 54 mg / dL ) occurred in 13 . 8 % , 9 . 9 % , and 12 . 8 % , and severe hypoglycemia occurred in 0 . 5 % , 0 % , and 0 . 6 % of patients treated with MOUNJARO 5 mg , 10 mg , and 15 mg , respectively .
Heart Rate Increase In the pool of placebo - controlled trials , treatment with MOUNJARO resulted in a mean increase in heart rate of 2 to 4 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 1 beat per minute in placebo - treated patients .
Episodes of sinus tachycardia , associated with a concomitant increase from baseline in heart rate of ≥ 15 beats per minute , also were reported in 4 . 3 % , 4 . 6 % , 5 . 9 % and 10 % of subjects treated with placebo , MOUNJARO 5 mg , 10 mg , and 15 mg , respectively .
For patients enrolled in Japan , these episodes were reported in 7 % ( 3 / 43 ) , 7 . 1 % ( 3 / 42 ) , 9 . 3 % ( 4 / 43 ) , and 23 % ( 10 / 43 ) of patients treated with placebo , MOUNJARO 5 mg , 10 mg , and 15 mg , respectively .
The clinical relevance of heart rate increases is uncertain .
Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with MOUNJARO in the pool of placebo - controlled trials , sometimes severe ( e . g . , urticaria and eczema ) ; hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 3 . 2 % of MOUNJARO - treated patients compared to 1 . 7 % of placebo - treated patients .
In the pool of seven clinical trials , hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 106 / 2 , 570 ( 4 . 1 % ) of MOUNJARO - treated patients with anti - tirzepatide antibodies and in 73 / 2 , 455 ( 3 . 0 % ) of MOUNJARO - treated patients who did not develop anti - tirzepatide antibodies [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 6 ) ] .
Injection Site Reactions In the pool of placebo - controlled trials , injection site reactions were reported in 3 . 2 % of MOUNJARO - treated patients compared to 0 . 4 % of placebo - treated patients .
In the pool of seven clinical trials , injection site reactions occurred in 119 / 2 , 570 ( 4 . 6 % ) of MOUNJARO - treated patients with anti - tirzepatide antibodies and in 18 / 2 , 455 ( 0 . 7 % ) of MOUNJARO - treated patients who did not develop anti - tirzepatide antibodies [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 6 ) ] .
Acute Gallbladder Disease In the pool of placebo - controlled clinical trials , acute gallbladder disease ( cholelithiasis , biliary colic and cholecystectomy ) was reported by 0 . 6 % of MOUNJARO - treated patients and 0 % of placebo - treated patients .
Laboratory Abnormalities Amylase and Lipase Increase In the pool of placebo - controlled clinical trials , treatment with MOUNJARO resulted in mean increases from baseline in serum pancreatic amylase concentrations of 33 % to 38 % and serum lipase concentrations of 31 % to 42 % .
Placebo - treated patients had a mean increase from baseline in pancreatic amylase of 4 % and no changes were observed in lipase .
The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with MOUNJARO is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying and has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue ( e . g . , Sulfonylurea ) or with Insulin When initiating MOUNJARO , consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues ( e . g . , sulfonylureas ) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Oral Medications MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying , and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications .
Caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with MOUNJARO .
Monitor patients on oral medications dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy and those with a narrow therapeutic index ( e . g . , warfarin ) when concomitantly administered with MOUNJARO .
Advise patients using oral hormonal contraceptives to switch to a non - oral contraceptive method , or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation with MOUNJARO .
Hormonal contraceptives that are not administered orally should not be affected [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal study , may cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Females of Reproductive Potential : Advise females using oral contraceptives to switch to a non - oral contraceptive method , or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation .
( 7 . 2 , 8 . 3 , 12 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with MOUNJARO use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug - related risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Based on animal reproduction studies , there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to tirzepatide during pregnancy .
MOUNJARO should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
In pregnant rats administered tirzepatide during organogenesis , fetal growth reductions and fetal abnormalities occurred at clinical exposure in maternal rats based on AUC .
In rabbits administered tirzepatide during organogenesis , fetal growth reductions were observed at clinically relevant exposures based on AUC .
These adverse embryo / fetal effects in animals coincided with pharmacological effects on maternal weight and food consumption ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 – 10 % in women with pre - gestational diabetes with an HbA1c > 7 % and has been reported to be as high as 20 – 25 % in women with an HbA1c > 10 % .
The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4 % and 15 – 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo / Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , pre - eclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , stillbirth , and macrosomia - related morbidity .
Data Animal Data In pregnant rats given twice weekly subcutaneous doses of 0 . 02 , 0 . 1 , and 0 . 5 mg / kg tirzepatide ( 0 . 03 - , 0 . 07 - , and 0 . 5 - fold the MRHD of 15 mg once weekly based on AUC ) during organogenesis , increased incidences of external , visceral , and skeletal malformations , increased incidences of visceral and skeletal developmental variations , and decreased fetal weights coincided with pharmacologically - mediated reductions in maternal body weights and food consumption at 0 . 5 mg / kg .
In pregnant rabbits given once weekly subcutaneous doses of 0 . 01 , 0 . 03 , or 0 . 1 mg / kg tirzepatide ( 0 . 01 - , 0 . 06 - , and 0 . 2 - fold the MRHD ) during organogenesis , pharmacologically - mediated effects on the gastrointestinal system resulting in maternal mortality or abortion in a few rabbits occurred at all dose levels .
Reduced fetal weights associated with decreased maternal food consumption and body weights were observed at 0 . 1 mg / kg .
In a pre - and post - natal study in rats administered subcutaneous doses of 0 . 02 , 0 . 10 , or 0 . 25 mg / kg tirzepatide twice weekly from implantation through lactation , F1 pups from F0 maternal rats given 0 . 25 mg / kg tirzepatide had statistically significant lower mean body weight when compared to controls from post - natal day 7 through post - natal day 126 for males and post - natal day 56 for females .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tirzepatide in animal or human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for MOUNJARO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from MOUNJARO or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Use of MOUNJARO may reduce the efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives due to delayed gastric emptying .
This delay is largest after the first dose and diminishes over time .
Advise patients using oral hormonal contraceptives to switch to a non - oral contraceptive method , or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation with MOUNJARO [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of MOUNJARO have not been established in pediatric patients ( younger than 18 years of age ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In the pool of seven clinical trials , 1539 ( 30 . 1 % ) MOUNJARO - treated patients were 65 years of age or older , and 212 ( 4 . 1 % ) MOUNJARO - treated patients were 75 years of age or older at baseline .
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were detected between these patients and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment of MOUNJARO is recommended for patients with renal impairment .
In subjects with renal impairment including end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , no change in tirzepatide pharmacokinetics ( PK ) was observed [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses of MOUNJARO in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of MOUNJARO is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment .
In a clinical pharmacology study in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment , no change in tirzepatide PK was observed [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of an overdosage , contact Poison Control for latest recommendations .
Appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient ' s clinical signs and symptoms .
A period of observation and treatment for these symptoms may be necessary , taking into account the half - life of tirzepatide of approximately 5 days .

Hydrochloric acid solution and / or sodium hydroxide solution may have been added to adjust the pH . MOUNJARO has a pH of 6 . 5 – 7 . 5 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Tirzepatide is a GIP receptor and GLP - 1 receptor agonist .
It is a 39 - amino - acid modified peptide with a C20 fatty diacid moiety that enables albumin binding and prolongs the half - life .
Tirzepatide selectively binds to and activates both the GIP and GLP - 1 receptors , the targets for native GIP and GLP - 1 .
Tirzepatide enhances first - and second - phase insulin secretion , and reduces glucagon levels , both in a glucose - dependent manner .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Tirzepatide lowers fasting and postprandial glucose concentration , decreases food intake , and reduces body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
First and Second - Phase Insulin Secretion Tirzepatide enhances the first - and second - phase insulin secretion .
( Figure 1 ) Figure 1 : Mean insulin concentration at 0 - 120 minutes during hyperglycemic clamp at baseline and Week 28 [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Insulin Sensitivity Tirzepatide increases insulin sensitivity , as demonstrated in a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp study after 28 weeks of treatment .
Glucagon Secretion Tirzepatide reduces fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations .
Tirzepatide 15 mg reduced fasting glucagon concentration by 28 % and glucagon AUC after a mixed meal by 43 % , compared with no change for placebo after 28 weeks of treatment .
Gastric Emptying Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying .
The delay is largest after the first dose and this effect diminishes over time .
Tirzepatide slows post - meal glucose absorption , reducing postprandial glucose .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide is similar between healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Steady - state plasma tirzepatide concentrations were achieved following 4 weeks of once weekly administration .
Tirzepatide exposure increases in a dose - proportional manner .
Absorption Following subcutaneous administration , the time to maximum plasma concentration of tirzepatide ranges from 8 to 72 hours .
The mean absolute bioavailability of tirzepatide following subcutaneous administration is 80 % .
Similar exposure was achieved with subcutaneous administration of tirzepatide in the abdomen , thigh , or upper arm .
Distribution The mean apparent steady - state volume of distribution of tirzepatide following subcutaneous administration in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is approximately 10 . 3 L . Tirzepatide is highly bound to plasma albumin ( 99 % ) .
Elimination The apparent population mean clearance of tirzepatide is 0 . 061 L / h with an elimination half - life of approximately 5 days , enabling once - weekly dosing .
Metabolism Tirzepatide is metabolized by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone , beta - oxidation of the C20 fatty diacid moiety and amide hydrolysis .
Excretion The primary excretion routes of tirzepatide metabolites are via urine and feces .
Intact tirzepatide is not observed in urine or feces .
Specific Populations The intrinsic factors of age , gender , race , ethnicity , or body weight do not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of tirzepatide .
Patients with Renal Impairment Renal impairment does not impact the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide .
The pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide after a single 5 mg dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of renal impairment ( mild , moderate , severe , ESRD ) compared with subjects with normal renal function .
This was also shown for patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal impairment based on data from clinical studies [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not impact the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide .
The pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide after a single 5 mg dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment ( mild , moderate , severe ) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Drug Interactions Studies Potential for Tirzepatide to Influence the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs In vitro studies have shown low potential for tirzepatide to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes , and to inhibit drug transporters .
MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying , and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
The impact of tirzepatide on gastric emptying was greatest after a single dose of 5 mg and diminished after subsequent doses .
Following a first dose of tirzepatide 5 mg , acetaminophen maximum concentration ( Cmax ) was reduced by 50 % , and the median peak plasma concentration ( tmax ) occurred 1 hour later .
After coadministration at week 4 , there was no meaningful impact on acetaminophen Cmax and tmax .
Overall acetaminophen exposure ( AUC0 - 24 hr ) was not influenced .
Following administration of a combined oral contraceptive ( 0 . 035 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0 . 25 mg norgestimate ) in the presence of a single dose of tirzepatide 5 mg , mean Cmax of ethinyl estradiol , norgestimate , and norelgestromin was reduced by 59 % , 66 % , and 55 % , while mean AUC was reduced by 20 % , 21 % , and 23 % , respectively .
A delay in tmax of 2 . 5 to 4 . 5 hours was observed .
12 . 6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti - drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti - drug antibodies in the trials described below with the incidence of anti - drug antibodies in other trials , including those of tirzepatide or of GLP - 1 receptor agonist products .
During the 40 - to 104 - week treatment periods with ADA sampling conducted up to 44 to 108 weeks in seven clinical trials in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , 51 % ( 2 , 570 / 5 , 025 ) of MOUNJARO - treated patients developed anti - tirzepatide antibodies .
In these trials , anti - tirzepatide antibody formation in 34 % and 14 % of MOUNJARO - treated patients showed cross - reactivity to native GIP or native GLP - 1 , respectively .
Of the 2 , 570 MOUNJARO - treated patients who developed anti - tirzepatide antibodies during the treatment periods in these seven trials , 2 % and 2 % developed neutralizing antibodies against tirzepatide activity on the GIP or GLP - 1 receptors , respectively , and 0 . 9 % and 0 . 4 % developed neutralizing antibodies against native GIP or GLP - 1 , respectively .
There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti - tirzepatide antibodies on pharmacokinetics or effectiveness of MOUNJARO .
More MOUNJARO - treated patients who developed anti - tirzepatide antibodies experienced hypersensitivity reactions or injection site reactions than those who did not develop these antibodies [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility A 2 - year carcinogenicity study was conducted with tirzepatide in male and female rats at doses of 0 . 15 , 0 . 50 , and 1 . 5 mg / kg ( 0 . 1 - , 0 . 4 - , and 1 - fold the MRHD of 15 mg once weekly based on AUC ) administered by subcutaneous injection twice weekly .
A statistically significant increase in thyroid C - cell adenomas was observed in males ( ≥ 0 . 5 mg / kg ) and females ( ≥ 0 . 15 mg / kg ) , and a statistically significant increase in thyroid C - cell adenomas and carcinomas combined was observed in males and females at all doses examined .
In a 6 - month carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice , tirzepatide at doses of 1 , 3 , and 10 mg / kg administered by subcutaneous injection twice weekly was not tumorigenic .
Tirzepatide was not genotoxic in a rat bone marrow micronucleus assay .
In fertility and early embryonic development studies , male and female rats were administered twice weekly subcutaneous doses of 0 . 5 , 1 . 5 , or 3 mg / kg ( 0 . 3 - , 1 - , and 2 - fold and 0 . 3 - , 0 . 9 - , and 2 - fold , respectively , the MRHD of 15 mg once weekly based on AUC ) .
No effects of tirzepatide were observed on sperm morphology , mating , fertility , and conception .
In female rats , an increase in the number of females with prolonged diestrus and a decrease in the mean number of corpora lutea resulting in a decrease in the mean number of implantation sites and viable embryos was observed at all dose levels .
These effects were considered secondary to the pharmacological effects of tirzepatide on food consumption and body weight .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Overview of Clinical Studies The effectiveness of MOUNJARO as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus was established in five trials .
In these trials , MOUNJARO was studied as monotherapy ( SURPASS - 1 ) ; as an add - on to metformin , sulfonylureas , and / or sodium - glucose co - transporter 2 inhibitors ( SGLT2 inhibitors ) ( SURPASS - 2 , - 3 , and - 4 ) ; and in combination with basal insulin with or without metformin ( SURPASS - 5 ) .
In these trials , MOUNJARO ( 5 mg , 10 mg , and 15 mg given subcutaneously once weekly ) was compared with placebo , semaglutide 1 mg , insulin degludec , and / or insulin glargine .
In adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , treatment with MOUNJARO produced a statistically significant reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to placebo .
The effectiveness of MOUNJARO was not impacted by age , gender , race , ethnicity , region , or by baseline BMI , HbA1c , diabetes duration , or renal function .
14 . 2 Monotherapy Use of MOUNJARO in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus SURPASS - 1 ( NCT03954834 ) was a 40 - week double - blind trial that randomized 478 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control with diet and exercise to MOUNJARO 5 mg , MOUNJARO 10 mg , MOUNJARO 15 mg , or placebo once weekly .
Patients had a mean age of 54 years , and 52 % were men .
The mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 4 . 7 years , and the mean BMI was 32 kg / m2 .
Overall , 36 % were White , 35 % were Asian , 25 % were American Indians / Alaska Natives , and 5 % were Black or African American ; 43 % identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
Monotherapy with MOUNJARO 5 mg , 10 mg and 15 mg once weekly for 40 weeks resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared with placebo ( see Table 3 ) .
