( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Colitis : Clindamycin can cause severe colitis , which may result in death .
Diarrhea , bloody diarrhea , and colitis ( including pseudomembranous colitis ) have been reported with the use of clindamycin .
ZIANA Gel should be discontinued if significant diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposures : Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps .
Wear sunscreen daily .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Colitis Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of this product .
Diarrhea , bloody diarrhea , and colitis ( including pseudomembranous colitis ) have been reported with the use of topical clindamycin .
When significant diarrhea occurs , ZIANA Gel should be discontinued .
Severe colitis has occurred following oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy .
Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and / or worsen severe colitis .
Severe colitis may result in death .
Studies indicate a toxin ( s ) produced by clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic - associated colitis .
The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus .
Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C . difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically .
5 . 2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight , including sunlamps , should be avoided during the use of ZIANA Gel , and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin .
Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution .
Daily use of sunscreen products and protective apparel ( e . g . , a hat ) are recommended .
Weather extremes , such as wind or cold , also may be irritating to patients under treatment with ZIANA Gel .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Observed local adverse reactions in patients treated with ZIANA Gel were skin erythema , scaling , itching , burning , and stinging .
Other most commonly reported adverse events ( ≥ 1 % in patients treated with ZIANA Gel ) were nasopharyngitis , pharyngolaryngeal pain , dry skin , cough , and sinusitis .

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does , however , provide a basis for identifying the adverse reactions that appear to be related to drug use for approximating rates .
The safety data presented in Table 1 ( below ) reflects exposure to ZIANA Gel in 1853 patients with acne vulgaris .
Patients were 12 years and older and were treated once daily for 12 weeks .
Adverse reactions that were reported in ≥ 1 % of patients treated with ZIANA Gel were compared to adverse reactions in patients treated with clindamycin phosphate 1 . 2 % in vehicle gel , tretinoin 0 . 025 % in vehicle gel , and the vehicle gel alone : Table 1 : Adverse Reactions Reported in at Least 1 % of Patients Treated with ZIANA Gel : 12 - Week Studies ZIANA Gel N = 1853 N ( % ) Clindamycin N = 1428 N ( % ) Tretinoin N = 846 N ( % ) Vehicle N = 423 N ( % ) PATIENTS WITH AT LEAST ONE AR 497 ( 27 ) 342 ( 24 ) 225 ( 27 ) 91 ( 22 ) Nasopharyngitis 65 ( 4 ) 64 ( 5 ) 16 ( 2 ) 5 ( 1 ) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 29 ( 2 ) 18 ( 1 ) 5 ( 1 ) 7 ( 2 ) Dry skin 23 ( 1 ) 7 ( 1 ) 3 ( < 1 ) 0 ( 0 ) Cough 19 ( 1 ) 21 ( 2 ) 9 ( 1 ) 2 ( 1 ) Sinusitis 19 ( 1 ) 19 ( 1 ) 15 ( 2 ) 4 ( 1 ) NOTE : Formulations used in all treatment arms were in the ZIANA vehicle gel .
Cutaneous safety and tolerance evaluations were conducted at each study visit in all of the clinical trials by assessment of erythema , scaling , itching , burning , and stinging : Table 2 : ZIANA Gel - Treated Patients with Local Skin ReactionsLocal Reaction Baseline N = 1835 N ( % ) End of Treatment N = 1614 N ( % ) Erythema 636 ( 35 ) 416 ( 26 ) Scaling 237 ( 13 ) 280 ( 17 ) Itching 189 ( 10 ) 70 ( 4 ) Burning 38 ( 2 ) 56 ( 4 ) Stinging 33 ( 2 ) 27 ( 2 ) At each study visit , application site reactions on a scale of 0 ( none ) , 1 ( mild ) , 2 ( moderate ) , and 3 ( severe ) , and the mean scores were calculated for each of the local skin reactions .
In Studies 1 and 2 , 1277 subjects enrolled with moderate to severe acne , 854 subjects treated with ZIANA Gel and 423 treated with vehicle .
Analysis over the 12 - week period demonstrated that cutaneous irritation scores for erythema , scaling , itching , burning , and stinging peaked at 2 weeks of therapy , and were slightly higher for the ZIANA - treated group , decreasing thereafter .
One open - label 12 - month safety study for ZIANA Gel showed a similar adverse reaction profile as seen in the 12 - week studies .
Eighteen out of 442 subjects ( 4 % ) reported gastrointestinal symptoms .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Concomitant use of topical medications with a strong drying effect can increase skin irritation .
Use with caution .
( 7 . 1 ) • • ZIANA Gel should not be used in combination with erythromycin - containing products because of its clindamycin component .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Concomitant Topical Medication Concomitant topical medication , medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers , soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect , and products with high concentrations of alcohol , astringents , spices or lime should be used with caution .
When used with ZIANA Gel , there may be increased skin irritation .
7 . 2 Erythromycin ZIANA Gel should not be used in combination with erythromycin - containing products due to its clindamycin component .
In vitro studies have shown antagonism between these two antimicrobials .
The clinical significance of this in vitro antagonism is not known .
7 . 3 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents .
Therefore , ZIANA Gel should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C .
There are no well - controlled trials in pregnant women treated with ZIANA Gel .
ZIANA Gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
ZIANA Gel was tested for maternal and developmental toxicity in New Zealand White Rabbits with topical doses of 60 , 180 and 600 mg / kg / day .
ZIANA Gel at 600 mg / kg / day ( approximately 12 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100 % absorption and based on body surface area comparison ) was considered to be the no - observed - adverse - effect level ( NOAEL ) for maternal and developmental toxicity following dermal administration of ZIANA Gel for 2 weeks prior to artificial insemination and continuing until gestation day 18 , inclusive .
For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to human exposure , the recommended clinical dose is defined as 1 g of ZIANA Gel applied daily to a 60 kg person .
Clindamycin Teratology ( Segment II ) studies using clindamycin were performed orally in rats ( up to 600 mg / kg / day ) and mice ( up to 100 mg / kg / day ) ( 583 and 49 times amount of clindamycin in the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison , respectively ) or with subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 180 mg / kg / day ( 175 and 88 times the amount of clindamycin in the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison , respectively ) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity .
Tretinoin In oral Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin , decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg / kg / day ( ~ 78 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100 % absorption and based on body surface area comparison ) .
With widespread use of any drug , a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone .
Thirty cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin .
Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases , five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category , holoprosencephaly ( defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain ) .
The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known .
Dermal tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered in doses 40 times the recommended human clinical dose based on body surface area comparison .
Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered in doses 78 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in human milk following use of ZIANA Gel .
However , orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
It is not known whether tretinoin is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when ZIANA Gel is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ZIANA Gel in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established .
Clinical trials of ZIANA Gel included patients 12 – 17 years of age .
[ See Clinical Studies ( 14 ) . ]
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ZIANA Gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
11 DESCRIPTION ZIANA ( clindamycin phosphate 1 . 2 % and tretinoin 0 . 025 % ) Gel is an antibiotic and retinoid combination gel product with two active ingredients .
Clindamycin phosphate is a water - soluble ester of the semi - synthetic antibiotic produced by a 7 ( S ) - chloro - substitution of the 7 ( R ) - hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin .
The chemical name for clindamycin phosphate is Methyl 7 - chloro - 6 , 7 , 8 - trideoxy - 6 - ( 1 - methyl - trans - 4 - propyl - L - 2 - pyrrolidinecarboxamido ) - 1 - thio - L - threo - α - D - galacto - octopyranoside 2 - ( dihydrogen phosphate ) .
The structural formula for clindamycin phosphate is represented below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clindamycin phosphate : Molecular Formula : C18H34ClN2O8PS Molecular Weight : 504 . 97 The chemical name for tretinoin is 3 , 7 - Dimethyl - 9 - ( 2 , 6 , 6 - trimethyl - 1 - cyclohexen - 1 - yl ) - 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 nonatetraenoic acid ( all - trans form ) .
The structural formula for tretinoin is represented below : Tretinoin : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Formula : C20H28O2 Molecular Weight : 300 . 44 ZIANA Gel contains the following inactive ingredients : butylated hydroxytoluene NF , carbomer 981 NF , citric acid USP , edetate disodium USP , glycerin USP , methylparaben NF , polysorbate 80 NF , propylparaben NF , purified water USP and tromethamine USP .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanisms of Action Clindamycin [ See Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) . ]
Tretinoin Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown , current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation .
Additionally , tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In an open - label , multiple - dose study treating 12 subjects with moderate to severe acne , the percutaneous absorption of tretinoin following 14 consecutive daily applications of approximately 4 g of ZIANA Gel was minimal .
Quantifiable tretinoin plasma concentrations ranged from 1 . 0 to 1 . 6 ng / mL , with unquantifiable plasma concentrations in 50 % to 92 % of subjects at any given timepoint following administration .
The plasma concentrations of the key tretinoin metabolites , 13 - cis - retinoic acid and 4 - oxo - 13 - cis - retinoic acid , ranged from 1 . 0 to 1 . 4 ng / mL and from 1 . 6 to 6 . 5 ng / mL , respectively .
Plasma concentrations for clindamycin generally did not exceed 3 . 5 ng / mL , with the exception of one subject whose plasma concentration reached 13 . 1 ng / mL .
12 . 4 Microbiology Clindamycin binds to the 50 S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer , thereby suppressing bacterial protein synthesis .
Clindamycin has been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes , an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris ; however , the clinical significance of this activity against P . acnes was not examined in clinical trials with ZIANA Gel .
P . acnes resistance to clindamycin has been documented .
Resistance to clindamycin is often associated with resistance to erythromycin .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity , mutagenicity and impairment of fertility testing of ZIANA Gel have not been performed in any species .
Clindamycin The carcinogenicity of a 1 % clindamycin phosphate gel similar to ZIANA Gel was evaluated by daily application to mice for 2 years .
The daily doses used in this study were approximately 13 and 72 times higher than the human dose of clindamycin phosphate from ZIANA Gel , assuming complete absorption and based on body surface area comparison .
No significant increase in tumors was noted in the treated animals .
For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to human exposure , the recommended human topical clinical dose is defined as 1 g of ZIANA Gel applied daily to a 60 kg person .
Fertility ( Segment 1 ) studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg / kg / day of clindamycin ( approximately 290 times the amount of clindamycin delivered from the recommended clinical dose for ZIANA Gel , based on body surface area comparison ) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability .
Tretinoin In two independent studies with long - term topical application of tretinoin in mice , carcinogenicity was not observed .
In both studies , tretinoin was administered topically ( 0 . 025 % or 0 . 1 % ) three times per week for up to 2 years .
No carcinogenicity was observed with maximum effects of dermal amyloidosis in the basal layer of the skin .
Tretinoin has been shown to enhance photo co - carcinogenicity in properly performed specific studies , employing concurrent or intercurrent exposure to the drug and UV radiation .
The contribution of clindamycin to that effect is unknown .
Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear , patients should minimize exposure to sun .
The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in an in vitro Ames Salmonella reversion test and an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells .
Both tests were negative .
In oral Segment 1 studies in rats treated with tretinoin , the no - observed - effect - level was 2 mg / kg / day ( ~ 78 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100 % absorption and based on body surface area comparison ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of once daily use of ZIANA Gel for treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in three 12 - week prospective , multi - center , randomized , blinded studies in patients 12 years and older .
Studies 1 and 2 were of identical design , and compared ZIANA Gel to clindamycin in the vehicle gel , tretinoin in the vehicle gel , and the vehicle gel alone .
Patients with mild , moderate , or severe acne were enrolled in the studies .
The co - primary efficacy variables were : • 1 .
Mean percent change from baseline at Week 12 in • 1 .
inflammatory lesion counts , • 2 . non - inflammatory lesion counts , and • 3 .
total lesion counts • 2 .
Percent of subjects who cleared or almost cleared at Week 12 as judged by an Evaluator ' s Global Severity ( EGS ) score .
The EGS scoring scale used in all of the clinical trials for ZIANA Gel is as follows : Grade Description Clear Normal , clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris Almost Clear Rare non - inflammatory lesions present , with rare non - inflamed papules ( papules must be resolving and may be hyperpigmented , though not pink - red ) Mild Some non - inflammatory lesions are present , with few inflammatory lesions ( papules / pustules only ; no nodulocystic lesions ) Moderate Non - inflammatory lesions predominate , with multiple inflammatory lesions evident : several to many comedones and papules / pustules , and there may or may not be one small nodulo - cystic lesion Severe Inflammatory lesions are more apparent , many comedones and papules / pustules , there may or may not be a few nodulocystic lesions Very Severe Highly inflammatory lesions predominate , variable number of comedones , many papules / pustules and many nodulocystic lesions In Study 1 , a total of 1252 patients were enrolled , and in Study 2 , a total of 1288 patients were enrolled .
The combined results are presented in Table 3 .

In Study 3 , ZIANA Gel was compared to clindamycin gel in a total of 2010 patients with moderate or severe acne vulgaris ( see Table 3 ) .
As with Studies 1 and 2 , the co - primary endpoints were mean percent reduction in lesion counts ( inflammatory , non - inflammatory and total ) and the EGS score .
In Study 3 , success on the EGS score was assessed by the percentage of subjects who had at least 2 grades of improvement from Baseline to Week 12 .
