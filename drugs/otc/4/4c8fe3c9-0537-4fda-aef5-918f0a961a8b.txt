To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AVELOX and other antibacterial drugs , AVELOX should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AVELOX and other antibacterial drugs , AVELOX should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
AVELOX Tablets and IV are indicated for the treatment of adults ( ≥ 18 years of age ) with infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Use In Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Culture and Susceptibility Testing Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to moxifloxacin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
Therapy with AVELOX may be initiated before results of these tests are known ; once results become available , appropriate therapy should be continued .
AVELOX is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial indicated for treating infections in adults ≥ 18 years of age caused by designated , susceptible bacteria .

Table 1 : Dosage and Duration of Therapy in Adult PatientsType of Infection Dose Every 24 hours Duration ( days ) Acute Bacterial Sinusitis ( 1 . 1 ) 400 mg 10 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis ( 1 . 2 ) 400 mg 5 Community Acquired Pneumonia 400 mg 7 - 14 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections ( SSSI ) ( 1 . 4 ) 400 mg 7 Complicated SSSI ( 1 . 5 ) 400 mg 7 - 21 Complicated Intra - Abdominal Infections ( 1 . 6 ) 400 mg 5 - 14 Intravenous formulation is indicated when it offers a route of administration advantageous to the patient ( for example , patient cannot tolerate an oral dosage form ) .
When switching from intravenous to oral formulation , no dosage adjustment is necessary .
Patients whose therapy is started with AVELOX IV may be switched to AVELOX Tablets when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician .
2 . 2 Drug Interactions with Multivalent Cations Oral doses of AVELOX should be administered at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after products containing magnesium , aluminum , iron or zinc , including antacids , sucralfate , multivitamins and VIDEX ® ( didanosine ) chewable / buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 3 Administration Instructions AVELOX Tablets AVELOX Tablets can be taken with or without food , drink fluids liberally .
AVELOX IV Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
AVELOX IV should be administered by INTRAVENOUS infusion only .
It is not intended for intra - arterial , intramuscular , intrathecal , intraperitoneal , or subcutaneous administration .
AVELOX IV should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 60 minutes by direct infusion or through a Y - type intravenous infusion set which may already be in place .
Caution : rapid or bolus intravenous infusion must be avoided .
Because only limited data are available on the compatibility of AVELOX intravenous injection with other intravenous substances , additives or other medications should not be added to AVELOX IV or infused simultaneously through the same intravenous line .
If the same intravenous line or a Y - type line is used for sequential infusion of other drugs , or if the “ piggyback ” method of administration is used , the line should be flushed before and after infusion of AVELOX IV with an infusion solution compatible with AVELOX IV as well as with other drug ( s ) administered via this common line .
AVELOX IV is compatible with the following intravenous solutions at ratios from 1 : 10 to 10 : 1 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP Sterile Water for Injection , USP 1 M Sodium Chloride Injection 10 % Dextrose for Injection , USP 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP Lactated Ringer ’ s for Injection 2 . 4 Preparation for Administration of AVELOX IV To prepare AVELOX IV injection premix in flexible containers : • Close flow control clamp of administration set .
• Remove cover from port at bottom of container .
• Insert piercing pin from an appropriate transfer set ( for example , one that does not require excessive force , such as ISO compatible administration set ) into port with a gentle twisting motion until pin is firmly seated .
NOTE : Refer to complete directions that have been provided with the administration set .

Known hypersensitivity to AVELOX or other quinolones ( 4 , 5 . 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture .
This risk is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age , in patients taking corticosteroids , and in patients with kidney , heart or lung transplants .
Discontinue if pain or inflammation in a tendon occurs .
( 5 . 1 , 8 . 5 ) • Prolongation of the QT interval and isolated cases of torsade de pointes has been reported .
Avoid use in patients with known prolongation , hypokalemia , and with drugs that prolong the QT interval .
( 5 . 3 , 7 . 4 , 8 . 5 ) .
Use caution in patients with proarrhythmic conditions such as clinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial ischemia .
( 5 . 3 ) • Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactic reactions , may occur after first or subsequent doses .
Discontinue drug use at first sign of skin rash , jaundice or any other sign of hypersensitivity .
( 5 . 4 , 5 . 5 ) • Central nervous system ( CNS ) events including dizziness , confusion , hallucination , depression , and rarely suicidal thoughts or acts may occur after first dose .
Use caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold .
( 5 . 6 ) • Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea : Evaluate if diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 7 ) • Peripheral neuropathy : Discontinue if symptoms occur .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture Fluoroquinolones , including AVELOX , are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages .
This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon , and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair .
Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff ( the shoulder ) , the hand , the biceps , the thumb , and other tendon sites have also been reported .
The risk of developing fluoroquinolone - associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age , in patients taking corticosteroid drugs , and in patients with kidney , heart or lung transplants .
Factors , in addition to age and corticosteroid use , that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity , renal failure , and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis .
Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors .
Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy ; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported .
AVELOX should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain , swelling , inflammation or rupture of a tendon .
Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture , and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non - quinolone antimicrobial drug .
[ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 4 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) . ]
5 . 2 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Fluoroquinolones , including AVELOX , have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis .
Postmarketing serious adverse events , including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support , have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis .
Avoid AVELOX in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 QT Prolongation AVELOX has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients .
Following oral dosing with 400 mg of AVELOX the mean ( ± SD ) change in QTc from the pre - dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec ( ± 26 ) ( n = 787 ) .
Following a course of daily intravenous dosing ( 400 mg ; 1 hour infusion each day ) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre - dose value was 10 msec ( ± 22 ) on Day 1 ( n = 667 ) and 7 msec ( ± 24 ) on Day 3 ( n = 667 ) .
The drug should be avoided in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval , patients with uncorrected hypokalemia and patients receiving Class IA ( for example , quinidine , procainamide ) or Class III ( for example , amiodarone , sotalol ) antiarrhythmic agents , due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations .
Pharmacokinetic studies between AVELOX and other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride , erythromycin , antipsychotics , and tricyclic antidepressants have not been performed .
An additive effect of AVELOX and these drugs cannot be excluded ; therefore caution should be exercised when AVELOX is given concurrently with these drugs .
In premarketing clinical trials , the rate of cardiovascular adverse events was similar in 798 AVELOX and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval .
AVELOX should be used with caution in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions , such as clinically significant bradycardia , acute myocardial ischemia .
The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation .
Therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded .
QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes .
No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with AVELOX treatment in over 15 , 500 patients in controlled clinical studies , including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment , and there was no increase in mortality in over 18 , 000 AVELOX tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed .
Elderly patients using IV AVELOX may be more susceptible to drug - associated QT prolongation [ see Use In Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
In addition , AVELOX should be used with caution in patients with mild , moderate , or severe liver cirrhosis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious anaphylactic reactions , some following the first dose , have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy , including AVELOX .
Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse , loss of consciousness , tingling , pharyngeal or facial edema , dyspnea , urticaria , and itching .
Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine .
AVELOX should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity .
Oxygen , intravenous steroids , and airway management , including intubation , may be administered as indicated [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 5 Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Reactions Other serious and sometimes fatal events , some due to hypersensitivity , and some due to uncertain etiology , have been reported rarely in patients receiving therapy with quinolones , including AVELOX .
These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses .
Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following : • Fever , rash , or severe dermatologic reactions ( for example , toxic epidermal necrolysis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome ) • Vasculitis ; arthralgia ; myalgia ; serum sickness • Allergic pneumonitis • Interstitial nephritis ; acute renal insufficiency or failure • Hepatitis ; jaundice ; acute hepatic necrosis or failure • Anemia , including hemolytic and aplastic ; thrombocytopenia , including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ; leukopenia ; agranulocytosis ; pancytopenia ; and / or other hematologic abnormalities The drug should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash , jaundice , or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 4 ) .
5 . 6 Central Nervous System Effects Quinolones , including AVELOX , may cause central nervous system ( CNS ) events , including : nervousness , agitation , insomnia , anxiety , nightmares or paranoia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 , 6 . 4 ) ] .
Convulsions have been reported in patients receiving quinolones .
Quinolones may also cause central nervous system ( CNS ) events including : dizziness , confusion , tremors , hallucinations , depression , and , rarely , suicidal thoughts or acts .
These reactions may occur following the first dose .
If these reactions occur in patients receiving AVELOX , the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted .
As with all quinolones , AVELOX should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders ( for example , severe cerebral arteriosclerosis , epilepsy ) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 , 6 . 4 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Clostridium Difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including AVELOX , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 8 Peripheral Neuropathy Rare cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and / or large axons resulting in paresthesias , hypoesthesias , dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving quinolones [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 9 Arthropathic Effects in Animals The oral administration of AVELOX caused lameness in immature dogs .
Histopathological examination of the weight - bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage .
Related quinolone - class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight - bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species [ see Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 10 Photosensitivity / Phototoxicity Moderate to severe photosensitivity / phototoxicity reactions , the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions ( for example , burning , erythema , exudation , vesicles , blistering , edema ) involving areas exposed to light ( typically the face , “ V ” area of the neck , extensor surfaces of the forearms , dorsa of the hands ) , can be associated with the use of quinolone antibiotics after sun or UV light exposure .
Therefore , excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided .
Drug therapy should be discontinued if phototoxicity occurs [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 4 ) and Pharmacokinetics ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 11 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing AVELOX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common reactions ( ≥ 3 % ) were nausea , diarrhea , headache , and dizziness ( 6 . 2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc . at 1 - 888 - 842 - 2937 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 6 . 1 Serious and Otherwise Important Adverse Reactions The following serious and otherwise important adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in the warnings and precautions section of the label : • Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • QT Prolongation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Central Nervous System Effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Clostridium difficile - Associated Diarrhea [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • Peripheral Neuropathy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] • Photosensitivity / Phototoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] • Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] 6 . 2 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data described below reflect exposure to AVELOX in 14981 patients in 71 active controlled Phase II - IV clinical trials in different indications [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
The population studied had a mean age of 50 years ( approximately 73 % of the population was < 65 years of age ) , 50 % were male , 63 % were Caucasian , 12 % were Asian and 9 % were Black .
Patients received AVELOX 400 mg once daily PO , IV , or sequentially ( IV followed by PO ) .
Treatment duration was usually 6 - 10 days , and the mean number of days on therapy was 9 days .
Discontinuation of AVELOX due to adverse events occurred in 5 . 0 % of patients overall , 4 . 1 % of patients treated with 400 mg PO , 3 . 9 % with 400 mg IV and 8 . 2 % with sequential therapy 400 mg PO / IV .
The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg PO doses were nausea ( 0 . 8 % ) , diarrhea ( 0 . 5 % ) , dizziness ( 0 . 5 % ) , and vomiting ( 0 . 4 % ) .
The most common adverse event leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg IV dose was rash ( 0 . 5 % ) .
The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg IV / PO sequential dose were diarrhea ( 0 . 5 % ) , pyrexia ( 0 . 4 % ) .
Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1 % of AVELOX - treated patients and less common adverse reactions , occurring in 0 . 1 to < 1 % of AVELOX - treated patients , are shown in Tables 2 and Table 3 , respectively .
The most common adverse drug reactions ( ≥ 3 % ) are nausea , diarrhea , headache , and dizziness .

It cannot be determined if any of the above laboratory abnormalities were caused by the drug or the underlying condition being treated .
6 . 4 Postmarketing Experience Table 4 lists adverse reactions that have been identified during post - approval use of Avelox .
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .

Administer AVELOX Tablet at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after these products .
( 2 . 2 , 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 , 17 . 2 ) Warfarin Anticoagulant effect of warfarin may be enhanced .
Monitor prothrombin time / INR , watch for bleeding .
( 6 . 4 , 7 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) Class IA and Class III antiarrhythmics : Proarrhythmic effect may be enhanced .
Avoid concomitant use .
( 5 . 3 , 7 . 4 ) 7 . 1 Antacids , Sucralfate , Multivitamins and other products containing Multivalent Cations Quinolones form chelates with alkaline earth and transition metal cations .
Oral administration of quinolones with antacids containing aluminum or magnesium , with sucralfate , with metal cations such as iron , or with multivitamins containing iron or zinc , or with formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as VIDEX ® ( didanosine ) chewable / buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution , may substantially interfere with the absorption of quinolones , resulting in systemic concentrations considerably lower than desired .
Therefore , AVELOX should be taken at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after these agents [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Pharmacokinetics ( 12 . 3 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 2 ) ] .
7 . 2 Warfarin Quinolones , including AVELOX , have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin or its derivatives in the patient population .
In addition , infectious disease and its accompanying inflammatory process , age , and general status of the patient are risk factors for increased anticoagulant activity .
Therefore the prothrombin time , International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) , or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if a quinolone is administered concomitantly with warfarin or its derivatives [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 , 6 . 3 ) , Pharmacokinetics ( 12 . 3 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Nonsteroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) Although not observed with AVELOX in preclinical and clinical trials , the concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug with a quinolone may increase the risks of CNS stimulation and convulsions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 4 Drugs that Prolong QT There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction in humans between AVELOX and other drugs that prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram .
Sotalol , a Class III antiarrhythmic , has been shown to further increase the QTc interval when combined with high doses of intravenous ( IV ) AVELOX in dogs .
Therefore , AVELOX should be avoided with Class IA and Class III antiarrhythmics [ see Warnings and Precautions , ( 5 . 3 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data may cause fetal harm ( 8 . 1 ) • Geriatrics : Increased risk for severe tendon disorders further increased by concomitant corticosteroid therapy and increased risk of prolongation of the QT interval .
( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 , 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Because no adequate or well - controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women , AVELOX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Moxifloxacin was not teratogenic when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at oral doses as high as 500 mg / kg / day or 0 . 24 times the maximum recommended human dose based on systemic exposure ( AUC ) , but decreased fetal body weights and slightly delayed fetal skeletal development ( indicative of fetotoxicity ) were observed .
Intravenous administration of 80 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ( mg / m2 ) to pregnant rats resulted in maternal toxicity and a marginal effect on fetal and placental weights and the appearance of the placenta .
There was no evidence of teratogenicity at intravenous doses as high as 80 mg / kg / day .
Intravenous administration of 20 mg / kg / day ( approximately equal to the maximum recommended human oral dose based upon systemic exposure ) to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weights and delayed fetal skeletal ossification .
When rib and vertebral malformations were combined , there was an increased fetal and litter incidence of these effects .
Signs of maternal toxicity in rabbits at this dose included mortality , abortions , marked reduction of food consumption , decreased water intake , body weight loss and hypoactivity .
There was no evidence of teratogenicity when pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were given oral doses as high as 100 mg / kg / day ( 2 . 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based upon systemic exposure ) .
An increased incidence of smaller fetuses was observed at 100 mg / kg / day .
In an oral pre - and postnatal development study conducted in rats , effects observed at 500 mg / kg / day included slight increases in duration of pregnancy and prenatal loss , reduced pup birth weight and decreased neonatal survival .
Treatment - related maternal mortality occurred during gestation at 500 mg / kg / day in this study .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Moxifloxacin is excreted in the breast milk of rats .
Moxifloxacin may also be excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants who are nursing from mothers taking AVELOX , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not been established .
AVELOX causes arthropathy in juvenile animals [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as AVELOX .
This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy .
Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles , hand , shoulder , or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy ; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported .
Caution should be used when prescribing AVELOX to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids .
Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue AVELOX and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetic parameters of moxifloxacin are not significantly altered in mild , moderate , severe , or end - stage renal disease .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment , including those patients requiring hemodialysis ( HD ) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is recommended for mild , moderate , or severe hepatic insufficiency ( Child - Pugh Classes A , B , or C ) .
However , due to metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency , which may lead to QT prolongation , AVELOX should be used with caution in these patients [ see Warnings and Precaution ( 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology , ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Single oral overdoses up to 2 . 8 g were not associated with any serious adverse events .
In the event of acute overdose , the stomach should be emptied and adequate hydration maintained .
ECG monitoring is recommended due to the possibility of QT interval prolongation .
The patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment .
The administration of activated charcoal as soon as possible after oral overdose may prevent excessive increase of systemic moxifloxacin exposure .
About 3 % and 9 % of the dose of moxifloxacin , as well as about 2 % and 4 . 5 % of its glucuronide metabolite are removed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis , respectively .
Single oral AVELOX doses of 2000 , 500 , and 1500 mg / kg were lethal to rats , mice , and cynomolgus monkeys , respectively .
The minimum lethal intravenous dose in mice and rats was 100 mg / kg .
Adverse clinical signs included CNS and gastrointestinal effects such as decreased activity , somnolence , tremor , convulsions , vomiting and diarrhea .
11 DESCRIPTION AVELOX ( moxifloxacin hydrochloride ) is a synthetic broad spectrum antibacterial agent for oral and intravenous administration .
Moxifloxacin , a fluoroquinolone , is available as the monohydrochloride salt of 1 - cyclopropyl - 7 - [ ( S , S ) - 2 , 8 - diazabicyclo [ 4 . 3 . 0 ] non - 8 - yl ] - 6 - fluoro - 8 - methoxy - 1 , 4 - dihydro - 4 - oxo - 3 quinoline carboxylic acid .
It is a slightly yellow to yellow crystalline substance with a molecular weight of 437 . 9 .
Its empirical formula is C21H24FN3O4 * HCl and its chemical structure is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action AVELOX is a member of the flouroquinolone class of antibacterial agents [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Moxifloxacin , given as an oral tablet , is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract .
The absolute bioavailability of moxifloxacin is approximately 90 percent .
Co - administration with a high fat meal ( that is , 500 calories from fat ) does not affect the absorption of moxifloxacin .
Consumption of 1 cup of yogurt with moxifloxacin does not significantly affect the extent or rate of systemic absorption ( AUC ) .

The mean ( ± SD ) elimination half - life from plasma is 12 ± 1 . 3 hours ; steady - state is achieved after at least three days with a 400 mg once daily regimen .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Distribution Moxifloxacin is approximately 30 - 50 % bound to serum proteins , independent of drug concentration .
The volume of distribution of moxifloxacin ranges from 1 . 7 to 2 . 7 L / kg .
Moxifloxacin is widely distributed throughout the body , with tissue concentrations often exceeding plasma concentrations .
Moxifloxacin has been detected in the saliva , nasal and bronchial secretions , mucosa of the sinuses , skin blister fluid , subcutaneous tissue , skeletal muscle , and abdominal tissues and fluids following oral or intravenous administration of 400 mg .
Moxifloxacin concentrations measured post - dose in various tissues and fluids following a 400 mg oral or IV dose are summarized in Table 7 .
The rates of elimination of moxifloxacin from tissues generally parallel the elimination from plasma .
Metabolism Approximately 52 % of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is metabolized via glucuronide and sulfate conjugation .
The cytochrome P450 system is not involved in moxifloxacin metabolism , and is not affected by moxifloxacin .
The sulfate conjugate ( M1 ) accounts for approximately 38 % of the dose , and is eliminated primarily in the feces .
Approximately 14 % of an oral or intravenous dose is converted to a glucuronide conjugate ( M2 ) , which is excreted exclusively in the urine .
Peak plasma concentrations of M2 are approximately 40 % those of the parent drug , while plasma concentrations of M1 are generally less than 10 % those of moxifloxacin .
In vitro studies with cytochrome ( CYP ) P450 enzymes indicate that moxifloxacin does not inhibit CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP1A2 , suggesting that moxifloxacin is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these enzymes .
Excretion Approximately 45 % of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is excreted as unchanged drug ( ~ 20 % in urine and ~ 25 % in feces ) .
A total of 96 % ± 4 % of an oral dose is excreted as either unchanged drug or known metabolites .
The mean ( ± SD ) apparent total body clearance and renal clearance are 12 ± 2 L / hr and 2 . 6 ± 0 . 5 L / hr , respectively .
Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Following oral administration of 400 mg moxifloxacin for 10 days in 16 elderly ( 8 male ; 8 female ) and 17 young ( 8 male ; 9 female ) healthy volunteers , there were no age - related changes in moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics .
In 16 healthy male volunteers ( 8 young ; 8 elderly ) given a single 200 mg dose of oral moxifloxacin , the extent of systemic exposure ( AUC and Cmax ) was not statistically different between young and elderly males and elimination half - life was unchanged .
No dosage adjustment is necessary based on age .
In large phase III studies , the concentrations around the time of the end of the infusion in elderly patients following intravenous infusion of 400 mg were similar to those observed in young patients [ see Use In Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in pediatric subjects has not been studied [ see Use In Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Gender Following oral administration of 400 mg moxifloxacin daily for 10 days to 23 healthy males ( 19 - 75 years ) and 24 healthy females ( 19 - 70 years ) , the mean AUC and Cmax were 8 % and 16 % higher , respectively , in females compared to males .
There are no significant differences in moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics between male and female subjects when differences in body weight are taken into consideration .
A 400 mg single dose study was conducted in 18 young males and females .
The comparison of moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics in this study ( 9 young females and 9 young males ) showed no differences in AUC or Cmax due to gender .
Dosage adjustments based on gender are not necessary .
Race Steady - state moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics in male Japanese subjects were similar to those determined in Caucasians , with a mean Cmax of 4 . 1 mcg / mL , an AUC24 of 47 mcg • h / mL , and an elimination half - life of 14 hours , following 400 mg p . o . daily .
Renal Insufficiency The pharmacokinetic parameters of moxifloxacin are not significantly altered in mild , moderate , severe , or end - stage renal disease .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment , including those patients requiring hemodialysis ( HD ) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) .
In a single oral dose study of 24 patients with varying degrees of renal function from normal to severely impaired , the mean peak concentrations ( Cmax ) of moxifloxacin were reduced by 21 % and 28 % in the patients with moderate ( CLCR ≥ 30 and ≤ 60 mL / min ) and severe ( CLCR < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment , respectively .
The mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) in these patients was increased by 13 % .
In the moderate and severe renally impaired patients , the mean AUC for the sulfate conjugate ( M1 ) increased by 1 . 7 - fold ( ranging up to 2 . 8 - fold ) and mean AUC and Cmax for the glucuronide conjugate ( M2 ) increased by 2 . 8 - fold ( ranging up to 4 . 8 - fold ) and 1 . 4 - fold ( ranging up to 2 . 5 - fold ) , respectively .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) . ]
The pharmacokinetics of single dose and multiple dose moxifloxacin were studied in patients with CLCR < 20 mL / min on either hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( 8 HD , 8 CAPD ) .
Following a single 400 mg oral dose , the AUC of moxifloxacin in these HD and CAPD patients did not vary significantly from the AUC generally found in healthy volunteers .
Cmax values of moxifloxacin were reduced by about 45 % and 33 % in HD and CAPD patients , respectively , compared to healthy , historical controls .
The exposure ( AUC ) to the sulfate conjugate ( M1 ) increased by 1 . 4 - to 1 . 5 - fold in these patients .
The mean AUC of the glucuronide conjugate ( M2 ) increased by a factor of 7 . 5 , whereas the mean Cmax values of the glucuronide conjugate ( M2 ) increased by a factor of 2 . 5 to 3 , compared to healthy subjects .
The sulfate and the glucuronide conjugates of moxifloxacin are not microbiologically active , and the clinical implication of increased exposure to these metabolites in patients with renal disease including those undergoing HD and CAPD has not been studied .
Oral administration of 400 mg QD AVELOX for 7 days to patients on HD or CAPD produced mean systemic exposure ( AUCss ) to moxifloxacin similar to that generally seen in healthy volunteers .
Steady - state Cmax values were about 22 % lower in HD patients but were comparable between CAPD patients and healthy volunteers .
Both HD and CAPD removed only small amounts of moxifloxacin from the body ( approximately 9 % by HD , and 3 % by CAPD ) .
HD and CAPD also removed about 4 % and 2 % of the glucuronide metabolite ( M2 ) , respectively .
Hepatic Insufficiency No dosage adjustment is recommended for mild , moderate , or severe hepatic insufficiency ( Child - Pugh Classes A , B , or C ) .
However , due to metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency , which may lead to QT prolongation , AVELOX should be used with caution in these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
In 400 mg single oral dose studies in 6 patients with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) and 10 patients with moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic insufficiency , moxifloxacin mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) was 78 % and 102 % , respectively , of 18 healthy controls and mean peak concentration ( Cmax ) was 79 % and 84 % of controls .
The mean AUC of the sulfate conjugate of moxifloxacin ( M1 ) increased by 3 . 9 - fold ( ranging up to 5 . 9 - fold ) and 5 . 7 - fold ( ranging up to 8 - fold ) in the mild and moderate groups , respectively .
The mean Cmax of M1 increased by approximately 3 - fold in both groups ( ranging up to 4 . 7 - and 3 . 9 - fold ) .
The mean AUC of the glucuronide conjugate of moxifloxacin ( M2 ) increased by 1 . 5 - fold ( ranging up to 2 . 5 - fold ) in both groups .
The mean Cmax of M2 increased by 1 . 6 - and 1 . 3 - fold ( ranging up to 2 . 7 - and 2 . 1 - fold ) , respectively .
The clinical significance of increased exposure to the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates has not been studied .
In a subset of patients participating in a clinical trial , the plasma concentrations of moxifloxacin and metabolites determined approximately at the moxifloxacin Tmax following the first intravenous or oral AVELOX dose in the Child - Pugh Class C patients ( n = 10 ) were similar to those in the Child - Pugh Class A / B patients ( n = 5 ) , and also similar to those observed in healthy volunteer studies .
Photosensitivity Potential A study of the skin response to ultraviolet ( UVA and UVB ) and visible radiation conducted in 32 healthy volunteers ( 8 per group ) demonstrated that AVELOX does not show phototoxicity in comparison to placebo .
The minimum erythematous dose ( MED ) was measured before and after treatment with AVELOX ( 200 mg or 400 mg once daily ) , lomefloxacin ( 400 mg once daily ) , or placebo .
In this study , the MED measured for both doses of AVELOX were not significantly different from placebo , while lomefloxacin significantly lowered the MED .
It is difficult to ascribe relative photosensitivity / phototoxicity among various fluoroquinolones during actual patient use because other factors play a role in determining a subject ’ s susceptibility to this adverse event such as : a patient ’ s skin pigmentation , frequency and duration of sun and artificial ultraviolet light ( UV ) exposure , wearing of sunscreen and protective clothing , the use of other concomitant drugs and the dosage and duration of fluoroquinolone therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 3 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) ] .
Drug - Drug Interactions The following drug interactions were studied in healthy volunteers or patients .
Antacids and iron significantly reduced bioavailability of moxifloxacin , as observed with other quinolones [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Calcium , digoxin , itraconazole , morphine , probenecid , ranitidine , theophylline , and warfarin did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin .
These results and the data from in vitro studies suggest that moxifloxacin is unlikely to significantly alter the metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP1A2 enzymes .
Moxifloxacin had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of atenolol , digoxin , glyburide , itraconazole , oral contraceptives , theophylline , and warfarin [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Antacids When moxifloxacin ( single 400 mg tablet dose ) was administered two hours before , concomitantly , or 4 hours after an aluminum / magnesium - containing antacid ( 900 mg aluminum hydroxide and 600 mg magnesium hydroxide as a single oral dose ) to 12 healthy volunteers there was a 26 % , 60 % and 23 % reduction in the mean AUC of moxifloxacin , respectively .
Moxifloxacin should be taken at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after antacids containing magnesium or aluminum , as well as sucralfate , metal cations such as iron , and multivitamin preparations with zinc , or VIDEX ® ( didanosine ) chewable / buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Atenolol In a crossover study involving 24 healthy volunteers ( 12 male ; 12 female ) , the mean atenolol AUC following a single oral dose of 50 mg atenolol with placebo was similar to that observed when atenolol was given concomitantly with a single 400 mg oral dose of moxifloxacin .
The mean Cmax of single dose atenolol decreased by about 10 % following co - administration with a single dose of moxifloxacin .
Calcium Twelve healthy volunteers were administered concomitant moxifloxacin ( single 400 mg dose ) and calcium ( single dose of 500 mg Ca + + dietary supplement ) followed by an additional two doses of calcium 12 and 24 hours after moxifloxacin administration .
Calcium had no significant effect on the mean AUC of moxifloxacin .
The mean Cmax was slightly reduced and the time to maximum plasma concentration was prolonged when moxifloxacin was given with calcium compared to when moxifloxacin was given alone ( 2 . 5 hours versus 0 . 9 hours ) .
These differences are not considered to be clinically significant .
Digoxin No significant effect of moxifloxacin ( 400 mg once daily for two days ) on digoxin ( 0 . 6 mg as a single dose ) AUC was detected in a study involving 12 healthy volunteers .
The mean digoxin Cmax increased by about 50 % during the distribution phase of digoxin .
This transient increase in digoxin Cmax is not viewed to be clinically significant .
Moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics were similar in the presence or absence of digoxin .
No dosage adjustment for moxifloxacin or digoxin is required when these drugs are administered concomitantly .
Glyburide In diabetics , glyburide ( 2 . 5 mg once daily for two weeks pretreatment and for five days concurrently ) mean AUC and Cmax were 12 % and 21 % lower , respectively , when taken with moxifloxacin ( 400 mg once daily for five days ) in comparison to placebo .
Nonetheless , blood glucose levels were decreased slightly in patients taking glyburide and moxifloxacin in comparison to those taking glyburide alone , suggesting no interference by moxifloxacin on the activity of glyburide .
These interaction results are not viewed as clinically significant .
Iron When moxifloxacin tablets were administered concomitantly with iron ( ferrous sulfate 100 mg once daily for two days ) , the mean AUC and Cmax of moxifloxacin was reduced by 39 % and 59 % , respectively .
Moxifloxacin should only be taken more than 4 hours before or 8 hours after iron products [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Itraconazole In a study involving 11 healthy volunteers , there was no significant effect of itraconazole ( 200 mg once daily for 9 days ) , a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P4503A4 , on the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin ( a single 400 mg dose given on the 7 th day of itraconazole dosing ) .
In addition , moxifloxacin was shown not to affect the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole .
Morphine No significant effect of morphine sulfate ( a single 10 mg intramuscular dose ) on the mean AUC and Cmax of moxifloxacin ( 400 mg single dose ) was observed in a study of 20 healthy male and female volunteers .
Oral Contraceptives A placebo - controlled study in 29 healthy female subjects showed that moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 7 days did not interfere with the hormonal suppression of oral contraception with 0 . 15 mg levonorgestrel / 0 . 03 mg ethinylestradiol ( as measured by serum progesterone , FSH , estradiol , and LH ) , or with the pharmacokinetics of the administered contraceptive agents .
Probenecid Probenecid ( 500 mg twice daily for two days ) did not alter the renal clearance and total amount of moxifloxacin ( 400 mg single dose ) excreted renally in a study of 12 healthy volunteers .
Ranitidine No significant effect of ranitidine ( 150 mg twice daily for three days as pretreatment ) on the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin ( 400 mg single dose ) was detected in a study involving 10 healthy volunteers .
Theophylline No significant effect of moxifloxacin ( 200 mg every twelve hours for 3 days ) on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline ( 400 mg every twelve hours for 3 days ) was detected in a study involving 12 healthy volunteers .
In addition , theophylline was not shown to affect the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin .
The effect of co - administration of a 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin with theophylline has not been studied , but it is not expected to be clinically significant based on in vitro metabolic data showing that moxifloxacin does not inhibit the CYP1A2 isoenzyme .
Warfarin No significant effect of moxifloxacin ( 400 mg once daily for eight days ) on the pharmacokinetics of R - and S - warfarin ( 25 mg single dose of warfarin sodium on the fifth day ) was detected in a study involving 24 healthy volunteers .
No significant change in prothrombin time was observed [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Moxifloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of Gram - positive and Gram - negative microorganisms .
The bactericidal action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the topoisomerase II ( DNA gyrase ) and topoisomerase IV required for bacterial DNA replication , transcription , repair , and recombination .
It appears that the C8 - methoxy moiety contributes to enhanced activity and lower selection of resistant mutants of Gram - positive bacteria compared to the C8 - H moiety .
The presence of the bulky bicycloamine substituent at the C - 7 position prevents active efflux , associated with the NorA or pmrA genes seen in certain Gram - positive bacteria .
The mechanism of action for fluoroquinolones , including moxifloxacin , is different from that of macrolides , beta - lactams , aminoglycosides , or tetracyclines ; therefore , microorganisms resistant to these classes of drugs may be susceptible to moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones .
There is no known cross - resistance between moxifloxacin and other classes of antimicrobials .
Drug Resistance In vitro resistance to moxifloxacin develops slowly via multiple - step mutations .
Resistance to moxifloxacin occurs in vitro at a general frequency of between 1 . 8 x 10 – 9 to < 1 x 10 – 11 for Gram - positive bacteria .
Cross - resistance has been observed between moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones against Gram - negative bacteria .
Gram - positive bacteria resistant to other fluoroquinolones may , however , still be susceptible to moxifloxacin .
Activity in vitro and in vivo Moxifloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Aerobic Gram - positive microorganisms • Enterococcus faecalis ( many strains are only moderately susceptible ) • Staphylococcus aureus ( methicillin - susceptible strains only ) • Streptococcus anginosus • Streptococcus constellatus • Streptococcus pneumoniae ( including multi - drug resistant strains [ MDRSP ] * ) • Streptococcus pyogenes * MDRSP , Multi - drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae includes isolates previously known as PRSP ( Penicillin - resistant S . pneumoniae ) , and are strains resistant to two or more of the following antibiotics : penicillin ( MIC ) ≥ 2 mcg / mL ) , 2 nd generation cephalosporins ( for example , cefuroxime ) , macrolides , tetracyclines , and trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole .
Aerobic Gram - negative microorganisms • Enterobacter cloacae • Escherichia coli • Haemophilus influenzae • Haemophilus parainfluenzae • Klebsiella pneumoniae • Moraxella catarrhalis • Proteus mirabilis Anaerobic microorganisms • Bacteroides fragilis • Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron • Clostridium perfringens • Peptostreptococcus species Other microorganisms • Chlamydophila pneumoniae • Mycoplasma pneumoniae The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
Moxifloxacin exhibits in vitro MICs of 2 mcg / mL or less against most ( ≥ 90 % ) strains of the following microorganisms ; however , the safety and effectiveness of AVELOX in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well - controlled clinical trials .
Aerobic Gram - positive microorganisms • Staphylococcus epidermidis ( methicillin - susceptible strains only ) • Streptococcus agalactiae • Streptococcus viridans group Aerobic Gram - negative microorganisms • Citrobacter freundii • Klebsiella oxytoca • Legionella pneumophila Anaerobic microorganisms • Fusobacterium species • Prevotella species Susceptibility Tests Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial MICs .
These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure .
Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1 ( broth or agar ) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of moxifloxacin powder .
The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria : For testing Enterobacteriaceae and methicillin - susceptible Staphylococcus aureus : MIC ( mcg / mL ) Interpretation ≤ 2 Susceptible ( S ) 4 Intermediate ( I ) ≥ 8 Resistant ( R ) For testing Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzaea : MIC ( mcg / mL ) Interpretation ≤ 1 Susceptible ( S ) a This interpretive standard is applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility tests with Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium1 .
The current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any results other than “ Susceptible . ”
Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a “ nonsusceptible ” category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing .
For testing Streptococcus species including Streptococcus pneumoniae b and Enterococcus faecalis : MIC ( mcg / mL ) Interpretation ≤ 1 Susceptible ( S ) 2 Intermediate ( I ) ≥ 4 Resistant ( R ) b These interpretive standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility tests using cation - adjusted Mueller - Hinton broth with 2 - 5 % lysed horse blood .
A report of “ Susceptible ” indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable .
A report of “ Intermediate ” indicates that the result should be considered equivocal , and , if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative , clinically feasible drugs , the test should be repeated .
This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of drug can be used .
This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation .
A report of “ Resistant ” indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable ; other therapy should be selected .
Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures .
Standard moxifloxacin powder should provide the following MIC values : Microorganism MIC ( mcg / mL ) Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 0 . 06 - 0 . 5 Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 0 . 008 - 0 . 06 Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 c 0 . 008 - 0 . 03 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 0 . 015 - 0 . 06 Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 d 0 . 06 - 0 . 25 c This quality control range is applicable to only H . influenzae ATCC 49247 tested by a broth microdilution procedure using Haemophilus Test Medium ( HTM ) 1 .
d This quality control range is applicable to only S . pneumoniae ATCC 49619 tested by a broth microdilution procedure using cation - adjusted Mueller - Hinton broth with 2 - 5 % lysed horse blood .
Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
One such standardized procedure2 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations .
This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 5 - mcg moxifloxacin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to moxifloxacin .
Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single - disk susceptibility test with a 5 - mcg moxifloxacin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria : The following zone diameter interpretive criteria should be used for testing Enterobacteriaceae and methicillin - susceptible Staphylococcus aureus : Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 19 Susceptible ( S ) 16 – 18 Intermediate ( I ) ≤ 15 Resistant ( R ) For testing Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzaee : Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 18 Susceptible ( S ) eThis zone diameter standard is applicable only to tests with Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium ( HTM ) 2 .
The current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any results other than “ Susceptible ” .
Strains yielding zone diameter results suggestive of a “ nonsusceptible ” category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing .
For testing Streptococcus species including Streptococcus pneumoniae f and Enterococcus faecalis : Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 18 Susceptible ( S ) 15 – 17 Intermediate ( I ) ≤ 14 Resistant ( R ) f These interpretive standards are applicable only to disk diffusion tests using Mueller - Hinton agar supplemented with 5 % sheep blood incubated in 5 % CO2 .
Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques .
Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for moxifloxacin .
As with standardized dilution techniques , diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures .
For the diffusion technique , the 5 - mcg moxifloxacin disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains : Microorganism Zone Diameter ( mm ) Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 28 – 35 Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 g 31 – 39 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 28 – 35 Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 h 25 – 31 gThese quality control limits are applicable to only H . influenzae ATCC 49247 testing using Haemophilus Test Medium ( HTM ) 2 .
h These quality control limits are applicable only to tests conducted with S . pneumoniae ATCC 49619 tested by a disk diffusion procedure using Mueller - Hinton agar supplemented with 5 % sheep blood and incubated in 5 % CO2 .
Anaerobic Techniques For anaerobic bacteria , the susceptibility to moxifloxacin as MICs can be determined by standardized procedures3 such as reference agar dilution methodsi .
The MICs obtained should be interpreted according to the following criteria : MIC ( mcg / mL ) Interpretation ≤ 2 Susceptible ( S ) 4 Intermediate ( I ) ≥ 8 Resistant ( R ) i This interpretive standard is applicable to reference agar dilution susceptibility tests using Brucella agar supplemented with hemin , vitamin K1 and 5 % laked sheep blood .
Acceptable ranges of MICs ( mcg / mL ) for control strains for reference agar dilution testing j : Microorganism MIC ( mcg / mL ) Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285 0 . 12 - 0 . 5 Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29741 1 - 4 Eubacterium lentum ATCC 43055 0 . 12 - 0 . 5 jThese quality control ranges are applicable to reference agar dilution tests using Brucella agar supplemented with hemin , vitamin K1 and 5 % laked sheep blood .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals to determine the carcinogenic potential of moxifloxacin have not been performed .
Moxifloxacin was not mutagenic in 4 bacterial strains ( TA 98 , TA 100 , TA 1535 , TA 1537 ) used in the Ames Salmonella reversion assay .
As with other quinolones , the positive response observed with moxifloxacin in strain TA 102 using the same assay may be due to the inhibition of DNA gyrase .
Moxifloxacin was not mutagenic in the CHO / HGPRT mammalian cell gene mutation assay .
An equivocal result was obtained in the same assay when v79 cells were used .
Moxifloxacin was clastogenic in the v79 chromosome aberration assay , but it did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes .
There was no evidence of genotoxicity in vivo in a micronucleus test or a dominant lethal test in mice .
Moxifloxacin had no effect on fertility in male and female rats at oral doses as high as 500 mg / kg / day , approximately 12 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ( mg / m2 ) , or at intravenous doses as high as 45 mg / kg / day , approximately equal to the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ( mg / m2 ) .
At 500 mg / kg orally there were slight effects on sperm morphology ( head - tail separation ) in male rats and on the estrous cycle in female rats .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Quinolones have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals .
In studies in juvenile dogs oral doses of moxifloxacin ≥ 30 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1 . 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based upon systemic exposure ) for 28 days resulted in arthropathy .
There was no evidence of arthropathy in mature monkeys and rats at oral doses up to 135 and 500 mg / kg / day , respectively .
Moxifloxacin at an oral dose of 300 mg / kg did not show an increase in acute toxicity or potential for CNS toxicity ( for example , seizures ) in mice when used in combination with NSAIDs such as diclofenac , ibuprofen , or fenbufen .
Some quinolones have been reported to have proconvulsant activity that is exacerbated with concomitant use of non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
A QT - prolonging effect of moxifloxacin was found in dog studies , at plasma concentrations about five times the human therapeutic level .
The combined infusion of sotalol , a Class III antiarrhythmic agent , with moxifloxacin induced a higher degree of QTc prolongation in dogs than that induced by the same dose ( 30 mg / kg ) of moxifloxacin alone .
Electrophysiological in vitro studies suggested an inhibition of the rapid activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current ( IKr ) as an underlying mechanism .
No signs of local intolerability were observed in dogs when moxifloxacin was administered intravenously .
After intra - arterial injection , inflammatory changes involving the peri - arterial soft tissue were observed suggesting that intra - arterial administration of AVELOX should be avoided .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis AVELOX Tablets ( 400 mg once daily for five days ) were evaluated for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis in a randomized , double - blind , controlled clinical trial conducted in the US .
This study compared AVELOX with clarithromycin ( 500 mg twice daily for 10 days ) and enrolled 629 patients .
Clinical success was assessed at 7 - 17 days post - therapy .
The clinical success for AVELOX was 89 % ( 222 / 250 ) compared to 89 % ( 224 / 251 ) for clarithromycin .

14 . 2 Community Acquired Pneumonia A randomized , double - blind , controlled clinical trial was conducted in the US to compare the efficacy of AVELOX Tablets ( 400 mg once daily ) to that of high - dose clarithromycin ( 500 mg twice daily ) in the treatment of patients with clinically and radiologically documented community acquired pneumonia .
This study enrolled 474 patients ( 382 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis conducted at the 14 - 35 day follow - up visit ) .
Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was 95 % ( 184 / 194 ) for AVELOX and 95 % ( 178 / 188 ) for high dose clarithromycin .
A randomized , double - blind , controlled trial was conducted in the US and Canada to compare the efficacy of sequential IV / PO AVELOX 400 mg QD for 7 - 14 days to an IV / PO fluoroquinolone control ( trovafloxacin or levofloxacin ) in the treatment of patients with clinically and radiologically documented community acquired pneumonia .
This study enrolled 516 patients , 362 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis conducted at the 7 - 30 day post - therapy visit .
The clinical success rate was 86 % ( 157 / 182 ) for AVELOX therapy and 89 % ( 161 / 180 ) for the fluoroquinolone comparators .
An open - label ex - US study that enrolled 628 patients compared AVELOX to sequential IV / PO amoxicillin / clavulanate ( 1 . 2 g IV q8h / 625 mg PO q8h ) with or without high - dose IV / PO clarithromycin ( 500 mg BID ) .
The intravenous formulations of the comparators are not FDA approved .
The clinical success rate at Day 5 - 7 for AVELOX therapy was 93 % ( 241 / 258 ) and demonstrated superiority to amoxicillin / clavulanate ± clarithromycin ( 85 % , 239 / 280 ) [ 95 % C . I . of difference in success rates between moxifloxacin and comparator ( 2 . 9 % , 13 . 2 % ) ] .
The clinical success rate at the 21 - 28 days post - therapy visit for AVELOX was 84 % ( 216 / 258 ) , which also demonstrated superiority to the comparators ( 74 % , 208 / 280 ) [ 95 % C . I . of difference in success rates between moxifloxacin and comparator ( 2 . 6 % , 16 . 3 % ) ] .
The clinical success rates by pathogen across four CAP studies are presented in Table 9 .

14 . 4 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis In a controlled double - blind study conducted in the US , AVELOX Tablets ( 400 mg once daily for ten days ) were compared with cefuroxime axetil ( 250 mg twice daily for ten days ) for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis .
The trial included 457 patients valid for the efficacy analysis .
Clinical success ( cure plus improvement ) at the 7 to 21 day post - therapy test of cure visit was 90 % for AVELOX and 89 % for cefuroxime .
An additional non - comparative study was conducted to gather bacteriological data and to evaluate microbiological eradication in adult patients treated with AVELOX 400 mg once daily for seven days .
All patients ( n = 336 ) underwent antral puncture in this study .
Clinical success rates and eradication / presumed eradication rates at the 21 to 37 day follow - up visit were 97 % ( 29 out of 30 ) for Streptococcus pneumoniae , 83 % ( 15 out of 18 ) for Moraxella catarrhalis , and 80 % ( 24 out of 30 ) for Haemophilus influenzae .
14 . 5 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections A randomized , double - blind , controlled clinical trial conducted in the US compared the efficacy of AVELOX 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin HCl 500 mg three times daily for seven days .
The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30 % , furuncles 8 % , cellulitis 16 % , impetigo 20 % , and other skin infections 26 % .
Adjunctive procedures ( incision and drainage or debridement ) were performed on 17 % of the AVELOX treated patients and 14 % of the comparator treated patients .
Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89 % ( 108 / 122 ) for AVELOX and 91 % ( 110 / 121 ) for cephalexin HCl .
14 . 6 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Two randomized , active controlled trials of cSSSI were performed .
A double - blind trial was conducted primarily in North America to compare the efficacy of sequential IV / PO AVELOX 400 mg QD for 7 - 14 days to an IV / PO beta - lactam / beta - lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI .
This study enrolled 617 patients , 335 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis .
A second open - label International study compared AVELOX 400 mg QD for 7 - 21 days to sequential IV / PO beta - lactam / beta - lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI .
This study enrolled 804 patients , 632 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis .
Surgical incision and drainage or debridement was performed on 55 % of the AVELOX treated and 53 % of the comparator treated patients in these studies and formed an integral part of therapy for this indication .
Success rates varied with the type of diagnosis ranging from 61 % in patients with infected ulcers to 90 % in patients with complicated erysipelas .
These rates were similar to those seen with comparator drugs .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDA - Approved Medication Guide 17 . 1 Antibacterial Resistance Antibacterial drugs including AVELOX should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( for example , the common cold ) .
When AVELOX is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by AVELOX or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
17 . 2 Administration With Food , Fluids , and Drug Products Containing Multivalent Cations Patients should be informed that AVELOX tablets may be taken with or without food .
Patients should be advised to drink fluids liberally .
AVELOX tablets should be taken at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after multivitamins ( containing iron or zinc ) , antacids ( containing magnesium or aluminum ) , sucralfate , or VIDEX ® ( didanosine ) chewable / buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution .
17 . 3 Serious and Potentially Serious Adverse Reactions To assure safe and effective use of AVELOX , patients should be informed of the following serious adverse reactions that have been associated with AVELOX and other fluoroquinolone use : • Tendon Disorders : Patients should contact their healthcare provider if they experience pain , swelling , or inflammation of a tendon , or weakness or inability to use one of their joints ; rest and refrain from exercise ; and discontinue AVELOX treatment .
The risk of severe tendon disorder with fluoroquinolones is higher in older patients usually over 60 years of age , in patients taking corticosteroid drugs , and in patients with kidney , heart or lung transplants .
• Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis : fluoroquinolones like AVELOX may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms , including muscle weakness and breathing problems .
Patients should call their healthcare provider right away if they have any worsening muscle weakness or breathing problems .
• Prolongation of the QT interval : AVELOX may produce changes in the electrocardiogram ( QTc interval prolongation ) .
AVELOX should be avoided in patients receiving Class IA ( for example quinidine , procainamide ) or Class III ( for example amiodarone , sotalol ) antiarrhythmic agents .
AVELOX may add to the QTc prolonging effects of other drugs such as cisapride , erythromycin , antipsychotics , and tricyclic antidepressants .
The patients should inform their physician of any personal or family history of QTc prolongation or proarrhythmic conditions such as recent hypokalemia , significant bradycardia , and acute myocardial ischemia .
Patients should contact their physician if they experience palpitations or fainting spells while taking AVELOX .
• Hypersensitivity Reactions : Patients should be advised that AVELOX may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactic reactions , even following a single dose .
Patients should discontinue AVELOX at the first sign of a skin rash or other signs of an allergic reaction .
• Convulsions : Convulsions have been reported in patients receiving quinolones , and they should notify their physician before taking AVELOX if there is a history of this condition .
Patients should also inform their physician if they are taking NSAIDs concurrently with AVELOX .
• Neurologic Adverse Effects ( for example , dizziness , lightheadedness ) : AVELOX may cause dizziness and lightheadedness ; therefore , patients should know how they react to this drug before they operate an automobile or machinery or engage in activities requiring mental alertness or coordination .
• Peripheral Neuropathies : If symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain , burning , tingling , numbness , and / or weakness develop , patients should discontinue AVELOX and contact their physician .
• Photosensitivity / Phototoxicity : Patients should be informed that photosensitivity / phototoxicity has been reported in patients receiving quinolones .
Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight ( tanning beds or UVA / B treatment ) while taking quinolones .
If patients need to be outdoors while using quinolones , they should wear loose - fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician .
If a sunburn - like reaction or skin eruption occurs , patients should contact their physician .
• Diarrhea : Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued .
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics , patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic .
If this occurs , patients should contact their physician as soon as possible .
MEDICATION GUIDE AVELOX ® ( AV - eh - locks ) ( moxifloxacin hydrochloride ) Tablets AVELOX ® I . V . ( AV - eh - locks ) ( moxifloxacin hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection ) Read the Medication Guide that comes with AVELOX ® before you start taking it and each time you get a refill .
There may be new information .
This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment .
What is the most important information I should know about AVELOX ?
AVELOX belongs to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones .
AVELOX can cause side effects that may be serious or even cause death .
If you get any of the following serious side effects , get medical help right away .
Talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should continue to take AVELOX .
• Tendon rupture or swelling of the tendon ( tendinitis ) • Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones .
• Pain , swelling , tears and inflammation of tendons including the back of the ankle ( Achilles ) , shoulder , hand , or other tendon sites can happen in people of all ages who take fluoroquinolone antibiotics , including AVELOX .
The risk of getting tendon problems is higher if you : • Are over 60 years of age • Are taking steroids ( corticosteroids ) • Have had a kidney , heart or lung transplant • Swelling of the tendon ( tendinitis ) and tendon rupture ( breakage ) have also happened in patients who take fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors .
• Other reasons for tendon ruptures can include : • Physical activity or exercise • Kidney failure • Tendon problems in the past , such as in people with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) • Call your healthcare provider right away at the first sign of tendon pain , swelling or inflammation .
Stop taking AVELOX until tendinitis or tendon rupture has been ruled out by your healthcare provider .
Avoid exercise and using the affected area .
The most common area of pain and swelling is in the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle .
This can also happen with other tendons .
Talk to your healthcare provider about the risk of tendon rupture with continued use of AVELOX .
You may need a different antibiotic that is not a fluoroquinolone to treat your infection .
• Tendon rupture can happen while you are taking or after you have finished taking AVELOX .
Tendon ruptures have happened up to several months after patients have finished taking their fluoroquinolone .
• Get medical help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of a tendon rupture : • Hear or feel a snap or pop in a tendon area • Bruising right after an injury in a tendon area • Unable to move the affected area or bear weight • Worsening of myasthenia gravis ( a disease which causes muscle weakness ) .
Fluoroquinolones like AVELOX may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms , including muscle weakness and breathing problems .
Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any worsening muscle weakness or breathing problems .
See the section “ What are the possible side effects of AVELOX ? ”
for more information about side effects .
What is AVELOX ?
AVELOX is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic medicine used to treat certain types of infections caused by certain germs called bacteria in adults 18 years or older .
It is not known if AVELOX is safe and works in people under 18 years of age .
Children have a higher chance of getting bone , joint , and tendon ( musculoskeletal ) problems while taking fluoroquinolone antibiotic medicines .
Sometimes infections are caused by viruses rather than by bacteria .
Examples include viral infections in the sinuses and lungs , such as the common cold or flu .
Antibiotics , including AVELOX , do not kill viruses .
