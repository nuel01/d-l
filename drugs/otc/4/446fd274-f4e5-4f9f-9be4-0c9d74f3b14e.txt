( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Never share a REZVOGLAR KwikPen prefilled pen between patients , even if the needle is changed .
( 5 . 1 ) • Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen : Make changes to a patient ' s insulin regimen ( e . g . , insulin strength , manufacturer , type , injection site or method of administration ) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypoglycemia : May be life - threatening .
Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to : insulin dosage , concomitant drugs , meal pattern , physical activity ; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness .
( 5 . 3 , 6 . 1 ) • Hypoglycemia due to medication errors : Accidental mix - ups between insulin products can occur .
Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection .
( 5 . 4 , 6 . 3 ) • Hypersensitivity reactions : Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , can occur .
Discontinue REZVOGLAR .
Monitor and treat if indicated .
( 5 . 5 , 6 . 1 ) • Hypokalemia : May be life - threatening .
Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated .
( 5 . 6 ) • Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure ; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Never Share a REZVOGLAR KwikPen Prefilled Pen Between Patients REZVOGLAR KwikPen prefilled pens must never be shared between patients , even if the needle is changed .
Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood - borne pathogens .
5 . 2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen ( e . g . , insulin strength , manufacturer , type , injection site or method of administration ) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] or hyperglycemia .
Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia ; and a sudden change in the injection site ( to unaffected area ) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Make any changes to a patient ' s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring .
Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia .
For patients with type 2 diabetes , dosage adjustments of concomitant oral and antidiabetic products may be needed .
5 . 3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins , including insulin glargine products .
Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures , may be life - threatening or cause death .
Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time ; this may place the patient and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important ( e . g . , driving or operating other machinery ) .
Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each patient and change over time in the same patient .
Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes , in patients with diabetic neuropathy , using drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system ( e . g . , beta - blockers ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] , or who experience recurrent hypoglycemia .
The long - acting effect of insulin glargine products may delay recovery from hypoglycemia .
Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and , in general , is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal .
As with all insulins , the glucose lowering effect time course of insulin glargine products may vary in different patients or at different times in the same patient and depends on many conditions , including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern ( e . g . , macronutrient content or timing of meals ) , changes in level of physical activity , or changes to concomitant drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) ] .
Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia .
Self - monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia .
In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia , increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended .
5 . 4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix - ups among insulin products have been reported .
To avoid medication errors between REZVOGLAR and other insulins , instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , can occur with insulins , including insulin glargine products [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
If hypersensitivity reactions occur , discontinue REZVOGLAR ; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve .
REZVOGLAR is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine products or one of the excipients in REZVOGLAR .
5 . 6 Hypokalemia All insulins , including insulin glargine products , cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space , possibly leading to hypokalemia .
Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis , ventricular arrhythmia , and death .
Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated ( e . g . , patients using potassium - lowering medications , patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations ) .
5 . 7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR - gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , which are peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( PPAR ) - gamma agonists , can cause dose - related fluid retention , when used in combination with insulin .
Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure .
Patients treated with insulin , including REZVOGLAR , and a PPAR - gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure .
If heart failure develops , it should be managed according to current standards of care , and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR - gamma agonist must be considered .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 2327 patients with type 1 diabetes to insulin glargine or NPH in Studies A , B , C , and D [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics : Mean age was 39 years .
Fifty - four percent were male , 97 % were Caucasian , 2 % were Black or African American and 3 % were Hispanic .
The mean BMI was 25 . 1 kg / m2 .
The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1563 patients with type 2 diabetes to insulin glargine or NPH in Studies E , F , and G [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics : Mean age was 59 years .
Fifty - eight percent were male , 87 % were Caucasian , 8 % were Black or African American and 9 % were Hispanic .
The mean BMI was 29 . 2 kg / m2 .
The frequencies of adverse reactions during insulin glargine clinical studies in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below ( Tables 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions Occurring ≥ 5 % in Pooled Clinical Studies up to 28 Weeks Duration in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes * Body system not specified Insulin Glargine , % ( n = 1257 ) NPH , % ( n = 1070 ) Upper respiratory tract infection 22 . 4 23 . 1 Infection * 9 . 4 10 . 3 Accidental injury 5 . 7 6 . 4 Headache 5 . 5 4 . 7 Table 2 : Adverse Reactions Occurring ≥ 5 % in Pooled Clinical Studies up to 1 Year Duration in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes * Body system not specified Insulin Glargine , % ( n = 849 ) NPH , % ( n = 714 ) Upper respiratory tract infection 11 . 4 13 . 3 Infection * 10 . 4 11 . 6 Retinal vascular disorder 5 . 8 7 . 4 Table 3 : Adverse Reactions Occurring ≥ 10 % in a 5 - Year Study of Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Insulin Glargine , % ( n = 514 ) NPH , % ( n = 503 ) Upper respiratory tract infection 29 . 0 33 . 6 Edema peripheral 20 . 0 22 . 7 Hypertension 19 . 6 18 . 9 Influenza 18 . 7 19 . 5 Sinusitis 18 . 5 17 . 9 Cataract 18 . 1 15 . 9 Bronchitis 15 . 2 14 . 1 Arthralgia 14 . 2 16 . 1 Pain in extremity 13 . 0 13 . 1 Back pain 12 . 8 12 . 3 Cough 12 . 1 7 . 4 Urinary tract infection 10 . 7 10 . 1 Diarrhea 10 . 7 10 . 3 Depression 10 . 5 9 . 7 Headache 10 . 3 9 . 3 Table 4 : Adverse Reactions Occurring ≥ 5 % in a 28 - Week Clinical Study in Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes * Body system not specified Insulin Glargine , % ( n = 174 ) NPH , % ( n = 175 ) Infection * 13 . 8 17 . 7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13 . 8 16 . 0 Pharyngitis 7 . 5 8 . 6 Rhinitis 5 . 2 5 . 1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia was the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients treated with insulin glargine .
Tables 5 , 6 , and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in insulin glargine clinical studies .
Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg / dL ( ≤ 56 mg / dL in the 5 - year study and ≤ 36 mg / dL in the ORIGIN study ) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate , intravenous glucose or glucagon administration .
Percentages of insulin glargine - treated adult patients who experienced severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the insulin glargine clinical studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] were comparable to percentages of NPH - treated patients for all treatment regimens ( see Tables 5 and 6 ) .
In the pediatric clinical study , pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult studies with type 1 diabetes .
Table 5 : Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin Insulin Glargine N = 292 NPH N = 293 Insulin Glargine N = 264 NPH N = 270 Insulin Glargine N = 310 NPH N = 309 Insulin Glargine N = 174 NPH N = 175 Percent of patients 10 . 6 15 . 0 8 . 7 10 . 4 6 . 5 5 . 2 23 . 0 28 . 6 Table 6 : Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin Insulin Glargine N = 289 NPH N = 281 Insulin Glargine N = 259 NPH N = 259 Insulin Glargine N = 513 NPH N = 504 Percent of patients 1 . 7 1 . 1 0 . 4 2 . 3 7 . 8 11 . 9 Table 7 displays the proportion of patients who experienced severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the insulin glargine and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Table 7 : Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN Study ORIGIN Study Median duration of follow - up : 6 . 2 years Insulin Glargine ( N = 6231 ) Standard Care ( N = 6273 ) Percent of patients 5 . 6 1 . 8 Peripheral Edema Some patients taking insulin glargine products have experienced sodium retention and edema , particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy .
Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously , including insulin glargine products , has resulted in lipoatrophy ( depression in the skin ) or lipohypertrophy ( enlargement or thickening of tissue ) in some patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Insulin Initiation and Intensification of Glucose Control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory , reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder , worsening of diabetic retinopathy , and acute painful peripheral neuropathy .
However , long - term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy .
Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with insulin including insulin glargine products and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria .
Hypersensitivity Reactions Local Reactions Patients taking insulin glargine experienced injection site reactions , including redness , pain , itching , urticaria , edema , and inflammation .
In clinical studies in adult patients , there was a higher incidence of injection site pain in insulin glargine - treated patients ( 2 . 7 % ) compared to NPH insulin - treated patients ( 0 . 7 % ) .
The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy .
Systemic Reactions Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , generalized skin reactions , angioedema , bronchospasm , hypotension , and shock have occurred with insulin , including insulin glargine products and may be life threatening .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other insulin glargine products may be misleading .
All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies .
The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose .
In clinical studies of insulin glargine , increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of insulin glargine products .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Medication errors have been reported in which rapid - acting insulins and other insulins , have been accidentally administered instead of insulin glargine products .
Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred .
Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis ; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site .

( 5 . 3 , 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies with use of insulin glargine products during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with insulin glargine products and adverse developmental outcomes ( see Data ) .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin glargine in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis , respectively 50 times and 10 times the human subcutaneous dosage of 0 . 2 units / kg / day .
Overall , the effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin ( see Data ) .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 % to 10 % in women with pregestational diabetes with a peri - conceptional HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 % to 25 % in women with a peri - conceptional HbA1c > 10 .
The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo - fetal Risk Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occur more frequently during pregnancy in patients with pre - gestational diabetes .
Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , preeclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery , and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , stillbirth , and macrosomia - related morbidity .
Data Human Data Published data do not report a clear association with insulin glargine products and major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin glargine is used during pregnancy .
However , these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size and some lacking comparator groups .
Animal Data Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits .
Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating , during mating , and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0 . 36 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0 . 2 units / kg / day ( 0 . 007 mg / kg / day ) , on a mg / kg basis .
In rabbits , doses of 0 . 072 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 10 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0 . 2 units / kg / day on a mg / kg basis , were administered during organogenesis .
The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits .
However , in rabbits , five fetuses from two litters of the high - dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles .
Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are either no or only limited data on the presence of insulin glargine products in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Endogenous insulin is present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for REZVOGLAR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from REZVOGLAR or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of insulin glargine products to improve glycemic control in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus have been established .
Use of insulin glargine for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well - controlled study ( Study D ) in 174 insulin glargine - treated pediatric patients aged 6 to 15 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus , and from adequate and well - controlled studies of insulin glargine in adults with diabetes mellitus [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
In the pediatric clinical study , pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia compared to the adults in studies with type 1 diabetes [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in controlled clinical studies of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were treated with insulin glargine , 15 % ( n = 316 ) were ≥ 65 years of age and 2 % ( n = 42 ) were ≥ 75 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of insulin glargine have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients .
Nevertheless , caution should be exercised when REZVOGLAR is administered to geriatric patients .
In geriatric patients with diabetes , the initial dosing , dosage increments , and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions .
Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in geriatric patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The effect of kidney impairment on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine products has not been studied .
Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with kidney failure .
Frequent glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary for REZVOGLAR in patients with kidney impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine products has not been studied .
Frequent glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary for REZVOGLAR in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates .
Lowering the insulin dosage , and adjustments in meal patterns or exercise may be needed .
More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma , seizure , or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon for emergency use or concentrated intravenous glucose .
After apparent clinical recovery from hypoglycemia , continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary to avoid recurrence of hypoglycemia .
Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately .
11 DESCRIPTION Insulin glargine - aglr is a long - acting human insulin analog produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non - pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli ( K12 ) .
Insulin glargine - aglr differs from human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position A21 is replaced by glycine and two arginines are added to the C - terminus of the B - chain .
Insulin glargine - aglr has a molecular weight of 6063 Da .
REZVOGLAR ( insulin glargine - aglr ) injection is a sterile , clear and colorless solution for subcutaneous use in a 3 mL single - patient use prefilled pen ( REZVOGLAR KwikPen ) .
Prefilled Pen ( REZVOGLAR KwikPen ) : Each mL contains 100 units of insulin glargine - aglr and the inactive ingredients : glycerin ( 17 mg ) , metacresol ( 2 . 7 mg ) , zinc oxide ( content adjusted to provide 30 mcg zinc ion ) , and Water for Injection , USP .
The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid 10 % and / or sodium hydroxide 10 % .
REZVOGLAR has a pH of approximately 4 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin , including insulin glargine products , is regulation of glucose metabolism .
Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake , especially by skeletal muscle and fat , and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production .
Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis , and enhances protein synthesis .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies , the glucose - lowering effect on a molar basis ( i . e . , when given at the same doses ) of intravenous insulin glargine is approximately the same as that for human insulin .
Figure 1 shows results from a study in patients with type 1 diabetes conducted for a maximum of 24 hours after subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine or NPH insulin .
The median time between subcutaneous injection and the end of pharmacological effect was 14 . 5 hours ( range : 9 . 5 to 19 . 3 hours ) for NPH insulin , and 24 hours ( range : 10 . 8 to > 24 hours ) ( 24 hours was the end of the observation period ) for insulin glargine .
Figure 1 : Glucose - Lowering Effect Over 24 Hours in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes [ MULTIMEDIA ] * Determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels The duration of action after abdominal , deltoid , or thigh subcutaneous administration of insulin glargine was similar .
The time course of action of insulins , including insulin glargine products , may vary between patients and within the same patient .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes , the insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower , more prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration / time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak in comparison to NPH insulin .
Elimination Metabolism A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar to that of human insulin , M1 ( 21 A - Gly - insulin ) and M2 ( 21 A - Gly - des - 30 B - Thr - insulin ) .
Unchanged drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation .
Specific Populations Age , Race , Body Mass Index , and Gender Effect of age , race , body mass index ( BMI ) , and gender on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine products has not been evaluated .
However , in controlled clinical studies in adults ( n = 3890 ) and a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients ( n = 349 ) , subgroup analyses based on age , race , BMI , and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between insulin glargine and NPH insulin [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In mice and rats , standard two - year carcinogenicity studies with insulin glargine were performed at doses up to 0 . 455 mg / kg , which was for the rat approximately 65 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0 . 2 units / kg / day ( 0 . 007 mg / kg / day ) on a mg / kg basis .
Histiocytomas were found at injection sites in male rats and mice in acid vehicle containing groups and are considered a response to chronic tissue irritation and inflammation in rodents .
These tumors were not found in female animals , in saline control , or insulin comparator groups using a different vehicle .
Insulin glargine was not mutagenic in tests for detection of gene mutations in bacteria and mammalian cells ( Ames - and HGPRT - test ) and in tests for detection of chromosomal aberrations ( cytogenetics in vitro in V79 cells and in vivo in Chinese hamsters ) .
In a combined fertility and prenatal and postnatal study of insulin glargine in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 0 . 36 mg / kg / day , which was approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 0 . 2 units / kg / day ( 0 . 007 mg / kg / day ) maternal toxicity due to dose - dependent hypoglycemia , including some deaths , was observed .
Consequently , a reduction of the rearing rate occurred in the high - dose group only .
Similar effects were observed with NPH insulin .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Overview of Clinical Studies The safety and effectiveness of insulin glargine given once - daily at bedtime was compared to that of once - daily and twice - daily NPH insulin in open - label , randomized , active - controlled , parallel studies of 2 , 327 adult patients and 349 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1 , 563 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( see Tables 9 - 11 ) .
In general , the reduction in glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) with insulin glargine was similar to that with NPH insulin .
14 . 2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes In two clinical studies ( Studies A and B ) , adult patients with type 1 diabetes ( Study A ; n = 585 , Study B ; n = 534 ) were randomized to 28 weeks of basal - bolus treatment with insulin glargine or NPH insulin .
Regular human insulin was administered before each meal .
Insulin glargine was administered at bedtime .
NPH insulin was administered either as once daily at bedtime or in the morning and at bedtime when used twice daily .
In Study A , the average age was 39 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 99 % ) and 56 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 24 . 9 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 16 years .
In Study B , the average age was 39 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 95 % ) and 51 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 25 . 8 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years .
In another clinical study ( Study C ) , patients with type 1 diabetes ( n = 619 ) were randomized to 16 weeks of basal - bolus treatment with insulin glargine or NPH insulin .
Insulin lispro was used before each meal .
Insulin glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily .
The average age was 39 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 97 % ) and 51 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 25 . 6 kg / m2 .

Insulin glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily .
The average age was 11 . 7 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 97 % ) and 52 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 18 . 9 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 5 years .
Similar effects on HbA1c ( Table 10 ) were observed in both treatment groups [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

The average age was 60 years old .
The majority of patients were White ( 93 % ) and 54 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 29 . 1 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years .
Insulin glargine administered once daily at bedtime was as effective as NPH insulin administered once daily at bedtime in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose ( Table 11 ) .
The rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was similar in insulin glargine and NPH insulin treated patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In a randomized , controlled clinical study ( Study F ) , in adult patients with type 2 diabetes not using oral antidiabetic medications ( n = 518 ) , a basal - bolus regimen of insulin glargine once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily was evaluated for 28 weeks .
Regular human insulin was used before meals , as needed .
The average age was 59 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 81 % ) and 60 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 30 . 5 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 14 years .
Insulin glargine had similar effectiveness as either once - or twice daily NPH insulin in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose ( Table 11 ) with a similar incidence of hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In a randomized , controlled clinical study ( Study G ) , adult patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once - daily insulin glargine or twice - daily NPH insulin .
For patients not previously treated with insulin , the starting dosage of insulin glargine or NPH insulin was 10 units daily .
Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started insulin glargine at a dosage that was 80 % of the total previous NPH insulin dosage .
The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) scale .
HbA1c change from baseline was a secondary endpoint .
Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data .
Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the insulin glargine and NPH insulin dosages to a target fasting plasma glucose ≤ 100 mg / dL .
After the insulin glargine or NPH insulin dosage was adjusted , other antidiabetic agents , including premeal insulin were to be adjusted or added .
The average age was 55 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 85 % ) and 54 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 34 . 3 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years .
The insulin glargine group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group , which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the insulin glargine group ( Table 11 ) .
The incidences of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia were similar between groups [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

Patients were also treated with insulin lispro at mealtime .
The average age was 41 years .
All patients were White ( 100 % ) and 54 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 25 . 3 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years .
Insulin glargine administered at pre - breakfast or at pre - dinner ( both once daily ) resulted in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration ( see Table 12 ) .
In these patients , data are available from 8 - point home glucose monitoring .
The maximum mean blood glucose was observed just prior to insulin glargine injection regardless of time of administration .
In this study , 5 % of patients in the insulin glargine - breakfast group discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy .
No patients in the other two groups ( pre - dinner , bedtime ) discontinued for this reason .
The safety and efficacy of once daily insulin glargine administered pre - breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized , active - controlled clinical study ( Study I , n = 697 ) in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic therapy .
All patients in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily .
The average age was 61 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 97 % ) and 54 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 28 . 7 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years .
Insulin glargine given before breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as insulin glargine given at bedtime or NPH insulin given at bedtime ( see Table 12 ) .

Patients had type 2 diabetes ( mean age 55 years ) with no ( 86 % ) or mild ( 14 % ) retinopathy at baseline .
Mean baseline HbA1c was 8 . 4 % .
The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint .
Patients with prespecified postbaseline eye procedures ( pan - retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy , local photocoagulation for new vessels , and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy ) were also considered as 3 - step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline .
Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment .
The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 13 for both the per - protocol and intent - to - treat populations , and indicate similarity of insulin glargine to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome .
In this study , the numbers of retinal adverse events reported for insulin glargine and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes .

One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of insulin glargine to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular ( CV ) outcomes in 12 , 537 adults ≥ 50 years of age with : • Abnormal glucose levels ( i . e . , impaired fasting glucose [ IFG ] and / or impaired glucose tolerance [ IGT ] ) or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and • Established CV disease or CV risk factors at baseline .
The objective of the study was to demonstrate that insulin glargine use could significantly lower the risk of major CV outcomes compared to standard care .
There were two coprimary composite CV endpoints : • The first coprimary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse CV event defined as the composite of CV death , nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke .
• The second coprimary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure .
Patients were randomized to either insulin glargine ( N = 6264 ) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of ≤ 95 mg / dL or to standard care ( N = 6273 ) .
Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline .
The mean age was 64 years and 8 % of patients were 75 years of age or older .
The majority of patients were male ( 65 % ) .
Fifty nine percent were Caucasian , 25 % were Latin , 10 % were Asian and 3 % were Black .
The median baseline BMI was 29 kg / m2 .
Approximately 12 % of patients had abnormal glucose levels ( IGT and / or IFG ) at baseline and 88 % had type 2 diabetes .
For patients with type 2 diabetes , 59 % were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug , 23 % had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6 % were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure .
The mean HbA1c ( SD ) at baseline was 6 . 5 % ( 1 . 0 ) .
Fifty - nine percent of the patients had had a prior CV event and 39 % had documented coronary artery disease or other CV risk factors .
Vital status was available for 99 . 9 % and 99 . 8 % of patients randomized to insulin glargine and standard care respectively at end of study .
The median duration of follow - up was 6 . 2 years ( range : 8 days to 7 . 9 years ) .
The mean HbA1c ( SD ) at the end of the study was 6 . 5 % ( 1 . 1 ) and 6 . 8 % ( 1 . 2 ) in the insulin glargine and standard care group respectively .
The median dose of insulin glargine at end of study was 0 . 45 U / kg .
Eighty - one percent of patients randomized to insulin glargine were using insulin glargine at end of the study .
The mean change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2 . 2 kg greater in the insulin glargine group than in the standard care group .
Overall , the incidence of major adverse CV outcomes was similar between groups ( see Table 14 ) .
All - cause mortality was also similar between groups .

What is REZVOGLAR ?
REZVOGLAR is a long - acting man - made insulin used to control high blood sugar in adults and children with diabetes mellitus .
REZVOGLAR is not for use to treat diabetic ketoacidosis .
Who should not use REZVOGLAR ?
Do not use REZVOGLAR if you : • are having an episode of low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) .
• have an allergy to insulin glargine products or any of the ingredients in REZVOGLAR .
See the end of this Patient Information leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in REZVOGLAR .
What should I tell my healthcare provider before using REZVOGLAR ?
Before using REZVOGLAR , tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions including if you : • have liver or kidney problems .
• take other medicines , especially ones called TZDs ( thiazolidinediones ) .
• have heart failure or other heart problems .
If you have heart failure , it may get worse while you take TZDs with REZVOGLAR .
• are pregnant , planning to become pregnant , or are breastfeeding .
It is not known if REZVOGLAR may harm your unborn baby or breastfeeding baby .
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take including prescription and over - the - counter medicines , vitamins , and herbal supplements .
Before you start using REZVOGLAR , talk to your healthcare provider about low blood sugar and how to manage it .
How should I use REZVOGLAR KwikPen ?
• Read the detailed Instructions for Use that come with your REZVOGLAR KwikPen single - patient - use prefilled pen .
• Use REZVOGLAR exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to .
Your healthcare provider should tell you how much REZVOGLAR to use and when to use it .

• Do not use REZVOGLAR in an insulin pump or inject REZVOGLAR into your vein ( intravenously ) .
• Change ( rotate ) your injection sites within area you chose with each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy ( pits in skin or thickened skin ) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis ( skin with lumps ) at the injection sites .
• Do not use the exact same spot for each injection .
• Do not inject where the skin has pits , is thickened , or has lumps .
• Do not inject where skin is tender , bruised , scaly or hard , or into scars or damaged skin .
• Do not mix REZVOGLAR with any other type of insulin or liquid medicine .
• Check your blood sugar levels .
Ask your healthcare provider what your blood sugar should be and when you should check your blood sugar levels .
Keep REZVOGLAR and all medicines out of the reach of children .
Your dose of REZVOGLAR may need to change because of : • a change in level of physical activity or exercise , weight gain or loss , increased stress , illness , change in diet , or because of the medicines you take .
What should I avoid while using REZVOGLAR ?
While using REZVOGLAR do not : • drive or operate heavy machinery , until you know how REZVOGLAR affects you .
