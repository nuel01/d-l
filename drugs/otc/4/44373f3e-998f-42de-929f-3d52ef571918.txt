( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Myelodysplastic Syndrome / Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( MDS / AML ) : Occurred in approximately 1 . 5 % of patients exposed to Lynparza monotherapy and the majority of events had a fatal outcome .
Monitor patients for hematological toxicity at baseline and monthly thereafter .
Discontinue if MDS / AML is confirmed .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Pneumonitis : Occurred in 0 . 8 % of patients exposed to Lynparza , and some cases were fatal .
Interrupt treatment if pneumonitis is suspected .
Discontinue if pneumonitis is confirmed .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Venous thromboembolic events ( VTE ) : VTE , including severe or fatal pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , occurred in patients treated with Lynparza .
VTE occurred in 7 % of patients with mCRPC .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of VTE and PE and treat as medically appropriate .
( 5 . 3 , 6 . 1 ) • • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception .
( 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • 5 . 1 Myelodysplastic Syndrome / Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) / Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) has occurred in patients treated with Lynparza and some cases were fatal .
In clinical studies enrolling 2901 patients with various cancers who received Lynparza as a single agent [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] , the cumulative incidence of MDS / AML was approximately 1 . 5 % ( 43 / 2901 ) .
Of these , 51 % ( 22 / 43 ) had a fatal outcome .
The median duration of therapy with Lynparza in patients who developed MDS / AML was 2 years ( range : < 6 months to > 10 years ) .
All of these patients had received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and / or other DNA damaging agents including radiotherapy .
Do not start Lynparza until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy ( ≤ Grade 1 ) .
Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment .
For prolonged hematological toxicities , interrupt Lynparza and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery .
If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks , refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations , including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics .
If MDS / AML is confirmed , discontinue Lynparza .
5 . 2 Pneumonitis In clinical studies enrolling 2901 patients with various cancers who received Lynparza as a single agent [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] , the incidence of pneumonitis , including fatal cases , was 0 . 8 % ( 24 / 2901 ) .
If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea , cough and fever , or a radiological abnormality occurs , interrupt Lynparza treatment and promptly assess the source of the symptoms .
If pneumonitis is confirmed , discontinue Lynparza treatment and treat the patient appropriately .
5 . 3 Venous Thromboembolic Events Venous thromboembolic events ( VTE ) , including severe or fatal pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , occurred in patients treated with Lynparza [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
VTE occurred in 7 % of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who received Lynparza plus androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) compared to 3 . 1 % of patients receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone plus ADT in the PROfound study .
Patients receiving Lynparza and ADT had a 6 % incidence of pulmonary embolism compared to 0 . 8 % of patients treated with ADT plus either enzalutamide or abiraterone .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate , which may include long - term anticoagulation as clinically indicated .
5 . 4 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Lynparza can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals .
In an animal reproduction study , administration of olaparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and embryo - fetal toxicity at exposures below those in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 300 mg twice daily .
Apprise pregnant women of the potential hazard to a fetus and the potential risk for loss of the pregnancy .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of Lynparza .
Based on findings from genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies , advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of Lynparza [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Lynparza .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity including angioedema .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Erythema nodosum , rash , dermatitis .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors : Avoid concomitant use .
If concomitant use cannot be avoided , reduce Lynparza dosage .
( 2 . 4 , 7 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) • • Strong or moderate CYP3A inducers : Avoid concomitant use .
( 7 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Use with Anticancer Agents Clinical studies of Lynparza with other myelosuppressive anticancer agents , including DNA damaging agents , indicate a potentiation and prolongation of myelosuppressive toxicity .
7 . 2 Effect of Other Drugs on Lynparza Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of CYP3A inhibitors can increase olaparib concentrations , which may increase the risk for adverse reactions [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors .
If the strong or moderate inhibitor must be coadministered , reduce the dose of Lynparza [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreased olaparib exposure , which may reduce Lynparza efficacy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , Lynparza can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available data on Lynparza use in pregnant women to inform the drug - associated risk .
In an animal reproduction study , the administration of olaparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and embryo - fetal toxicity at exposures below those in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 300 mg twice daily ( see Data ) .
Apprise pregnant women of the potential hazard to the fetus and the potential risk for loss of the pregnancy .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
The estimated background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 - 4 % ; and the risk for spontaneous abortion is approximately 15 - 20 % in clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats , olaparib was administered orally for 14 days before mating through to Day 6 of pregnancy , which resulted in increased post - implantation loss at a dose level of 15 mg / kg / day ( with maternal systemic exposures approximately 7 % of the human exposure ( AUC0 - 24 h ) at the recommended dose ) .
In an embryo - fetal development study , pregnant rats received oral doses of 0 . 05 and 0 . 5 mg / kg / day olaparib during the period of organogenesis .
A dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( with maternal systemic exposures approximately 0 . 18 % of human exposure ( AUC0 - 24 h ) at the recommended dose ) caused embryo - fetal toxicities including increased post - implantation loss and major malformations of the eyes ( anophthalmia , microphthalmia ) , vertebrae / ribs ( extra rib or ossification center ; fused or absent neural arches , ribs , and sternebrae ) , skull ( fused exoccipital ) , and diaphragm ( hernia ) .
Additional abnormalities or variants included incomplete or absent ossification ( vertebrae / sternebrae , ribs , limbs ) and other findings in the vertebrae / sternebrae , pelvic girdle , lung , thymus , liver , ureter , and umbilical artery .
Some findings noted above in the eyes , ribs , and ureter were observed at a dose of 0 . 05 mg / kg / day olaparib at lower incidence .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of olaparib in human milk , or on its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infants from Lynparza , advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with Lynparza and for one month after receiving the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Recommend pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with Lynparza .
Contraception Females Lynparza can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Lynparza and for at least 6 months following the last dose .
Males Based on findings in genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies , advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of Lynparza .
Advise male patients not to donate sperm during therapy and for 3 months following the last dose of Lynparza [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Lynparza have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 2901 patients with advanced solid tumors who received Lynparza as a single agent , 680 ( 23 % ) patients were aged ≥ 65 years , and this included 206 ( 7 % ) patients who were aged ≥ 75 years .
Thirteen ( 0 . 4 % ) patients were aged ≥ 85 years .
Of the 535 patients with advanced solid tumors who received Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily in combination with bevacizumab , 204 ( 38 % ) patients were aged ≥ 65 years , and this included 31 ( 6 % ) patients who were aged ≥ 75 years .
No overall differences in the safety or effectiveness of Lynparza were observed between these patients and younger patients .

11 DESCRIPTION Olaparib is a poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor .
The chemical name is 4 - [ ( 3 - { [ 4 - ( cyclopropylcarbonyl ) piperazin - 1 - yl ] carbonyl } - 4 - fluorophenyl ) methyl ] phthalazin - 1 ( 2 H ) - one .
The empirical molecular formula for Lynparza is C24H23FN4O3 and the relative molecular mass is 434 . 46 .
It has the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Olaparib is a crystalline solid , is non - chiral and shows pH - independent low solubility across the physiological pH range .
Lynparza ( olaparib ) tablets for oral use contain 100 mg or 150 mg of olaparib .
Inactive ingredients in the tablet core are copovidone , mannitol , colloidal silicon dioxide , and sodium stearyl fumarate .
The tablet coating consists of hypromellose , polyethylene glycol 400 , titanium dioxide , ferric oxide yellow , and ferrosoferric oxide ( 150 mg tablet only ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Olaparib is an inhibitor of poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) enzymes , including PARP1 , PARP2 , and PARP3 .
PARP enzymes are involved in normal cellular functions , such as DNA transcription and DNA repair .
Olaparib has been shown to inhibit growth of select tumor cell lines in vitro and decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer , both as monotherapy or following platinum - based chemotherapy .
Increased cytotoxicity and anti - tumor activity following treatment with olaparib were noted in cell lines and mouse tumor models with deficiencies in BRCA1 / 2 , ATM , or other genes involved in the homologous recombination repair ( HRR ) of DNA damage and correlated with platinum response .
In vitro studies have shown that olaparib - induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP - DNA complexes , resulting in DNA damage and cancer cell death .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of olaparib on cardiac repolarization was assessed in 119 patients following a single dose of 300 mg and in 109 patients following multiple dosing of 300 mg twice daily .
No clinically relevant effect of olaparib on QT interval was observed .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The area under the curve ( AUC ) of olaparib increases approximately proportionally following administration of single doses of 25 mg to 450 mg ( 0 . 08 to 1 . 5 times the recommended dose ) and maximal concentrations ( Cmax ) increased slightly less than proportionally for the same dose range .
Olaparib showed time - dependent pharmacokinetics and an AUC mean accumulation ratio of 1 . 8 is observed at steady state following a dose of 300 mg twice daily .
The mean ( CV % ) olaparib Cmax is 5 . 4 μg / mL ( 32 % ) and AUC is 39 . 2 μg * h / mL ( 44 % ) following a single 300 mg dose .
The mean steady state olaparib Cmax and AUC is 7 . 6 μg / mL ( 35 % ) and 49 . 2 μg * h / mL ( 44 % ) , following a dose of 300 mg twice daily .
Absorption Following oral administration of olaparib , the median time to peak plasma concentration is 1 . 5 hours .
Effect of Food Co - administration of a high fat and high calorie meal ( 800 - 1000 kcal , 50 % of the calorie content made up from fat ) with olaparib slowed the rate ( tmax delayed by 2 . 5 hours ) of absorption , but did not significantly alter the extent of olaparib absorption ( mean AUC increased by approximately 8 % ) .
Distribution The mean ( ± standard deviation ) apparent volume of distribution of olaparib is 158 ± 136 L following a single 300 mg dose of Lynparza .
The protein binding of olaparib is approximately 82 % in vitro .
Elimination The mean ( ± standard deviation ) terminal plasma half - life of olaparib is 14 . 9 ± 8 . 2 hours and the apparent plasma clearance is 7 . 4 ± 3 . 9 L / h following a single 300 mg dose of Lynparza .
Metabolism Olaparib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3 A in vitro .
Following an oral dose of radiolabeled olaparib to female patients , unchanged olaparib accounted for 70 % of the circulating radioactivity in plasma .
It was extensively metabolized with unchanged drug accounting for 15 % and 6 % of radioactivity in urine and feces , respectively .
The majority of the metabolism is attributable to oxidation reactions with a number of the components produced undergoing subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation .
Excretion Following a single dose of radiolabeled olaparib , 86 % of the dosed radioactivity was recovered within a 7 - day collection period , 44 % via the urine and 42 % via the feces .
The majority of the material was excreted as metabolites .
Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment In a renal impairment trial , the mean AUC increased by 24 % and Cmax by 15 % , when olaparib was dosed in patients with mild renal impairment ( CLcr = 51 - 80 mL / min defined by the Cockcroft - Gault equation ; n = 13 ) and by 44 % and 26 % , respectively , when olaparib was dosed in patients with moderate renal impairment ( CLcr = 31 - 50 mL / min ; n = 13 ) , compared to those with normal renal function ( CLcr ≥ 81 mL / min ; n = 12 ) .
There was no evidence of a relationship between the extent of plasma protein binding of olaparib and creatinine clearance .
There are no data in patients with severe renal impairment or end - stage renal disease ( CLcr ≤ 30 mL / min ) .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment In a hepatic impairment trial , the mean AUC increased by 15 % and the mean Cmax increased by 13 % when olaparib was dosed in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh classification A ; n = 10 ) and the mean AUC increased by 8 % and the mean Cmax decreased by 13 % when olaparib was dosed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh classification B ; n = 8 ) , compared to patients with normal hepatic function ( n = 13 ) .
Hepatic impairment has no effect on the protein binding of olaparib and , therefore , total plasma exposure was representative of free drug .
There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh classification C ) .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies CYP3A Inhibitors : Concomitant use of itraconazole ( strong CYP3A inhibitor ) increased olaparib Cmax by 42 % and AUC by 170 % .
Concomitant use of fluconazole ( moderate CYP3A inhibitor ) is predicted to increase olaparib Cmax by 14 % and AUC by 121 % .
CYP3A Inducers : Concomitant use of rifampicin ( strong CYP3A inducer ) decreased olaparib Cmax by 71 % and AUC by 87 % .
Concomitant use of efavirenz ( moderate CYP3A inducer ) is predicted to decrease olaparib Cmax by 31 % and AUC by 60 % .
In vitro Studies CYP Enzymes : Olaparib is both an inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A and an inducer of CYP2B6 .
Olaparib is predicted to be a weak CYP3A inhibitor in humans .
UGT Enzymes : Olaparib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 .
Transporters : Olaparib is an inhibitor of BCRP , OATP1B1 , OCT1 , OCT2 , OAT3 , MATE1 , and MATE2K .
Olaparib is a substrate and inhibitor of the efflux transporter P - gp .
The potential for olaparib to induce P - gp has not been evaluated .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with olaparib .
Olaparib was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells and in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay .
This clastogenicity is consistent with genomic instability resulting from the primary pharmacology of olaparib and indicates potential for genotoxicity in humans .
Olaparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) test .
In a fertility study , female rats received oral olaparib at doses of 0 . 05 , 0 . 5 , and 15 mg / kg / day for at least 14 days before mating through the first week of pregnancy .
There were no adverse effects on mating and fertility rates at doses up to 15 mg / kg / day ( maternal systemic exposures approximately 7 % of the human exposure ( AUC0 - 24 h ) at the recommended dose ) .
In a male fertility study , olaparib had no effect on mating and fertility in rats at oral doses up to 40 mg / kg / day following at least 70 days of olaparib treatment ( with systemic exposures of approximately 5 % of the human exposure ( AUC0 - 24 h ) at the recommended dose ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 First - Line Maintenance Treatment of BRCA - mutated Advanced Ovarian Cancer The efficacy of Lynparza was evaluated in SOLO - 1 ( NCT01844986 ) , a randomized ( 2 : 1 ) , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multi - center trial in patients with BRCA - mutated advanced ovarian , fallopian tube , or primary peritoneal cancer following first - line platinum - based chemotherapy .
Patients were randomized to receive Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily or placebo .
Treatment was continued for up to 2 years or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity ; however , patients with evidence of disease at 2 years , who in the opinion of the treating healthcare provider could derive further benefit from continuous treatment , could be treated beyond 2 years .
Randomization was stratified by response to first - line platinum - based chemotherapy ( complete or partial response ) .
The major efficacy outcome was investigator - assessed progression - free survival ( PFS ) evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , version 1 . 1 .
A total of 391 patients were randomized , 260 to Lynparza and 131 to placebo .
The median age of patients treated with Lynparza was 53 years ( range : 29 to 82 ) and 53 years ( range : 31 to 84 ) among patients on placebo .
The ECOG performance status ( PS ) was 0 in 77 % of patients receiving Lynparza and 80 % of patients receiving placebo .
Of all patients , 82 % were White , 36 % were enrolled in the U . S . or Canada , and 82 % were in complete response to their most recent platinum - based regimen .
The majority of patients ( n = 389 ) had germline BRCA mutation ( gBRCAm ) , and 2 patients had somatic BRCAm ( sBRCAm ) .
Of the 391 patients randomized in SOLO - 1 , 386 were retrospectively or prospectively tested with a Myriad BRACAnalysis test and 383 patients were confirmed to have deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm status ; 253 were randomized to the Lynparza arm and 130 to the placebo arm .
Two out of 391 patients randomized in SOLO - 1 were confirmed to have sBRCAm based on an investigational Foundation Medicine tissue test .
SOLO - 1 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in investigator - assessed PFS for Lynparza compared to placebo .
Results from a blinded independent review were consistent .
At the time of the analysis of PFS , overall survival ( OS ) data were not mature ( 21 % of patients had died ) .
Efficacy results are presented in Table 18 and Figure 1 .

Randomization was stratified by first - line treatment outcome ( timing and outcome of cytoreductive surgery and response to platinum - based chemotherapy ) and tBRCAm status , determined by prospective local testing .
All available clinical samples were retrospectively tested with Myriad myChoice ® CDx .
Patients were required to have no evidence of disease ( NED ) due to complete surgical resection , or who were in complete response ( CR ) , or partial response ( PR ) following completion of first - line platinum - containing chemotherapy and bevacizumab .
Patients were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to receive Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily in combination with bevacizumab ( n = 537 ) 15 mg / kg every three weeks or placebo / bevacizumab ( n = 269 ) .
Patients continued bevacizumab in the maintenance setting and started treatment with Lynparza after a minimum of 3 weeks and up to a maximum of 9 weeks following completion of their last dose of chemotherapy .
Lynparza treatment was continued for up to 2 years or until progression of the underlying disease or unacceptable toxicity .
Patients who in the opinion of the treating physician could derive further benefit from continuous treatment could be treated beyond 2 years .
Treatment with bevacizumab was for a total of up to 15 months , including the period given with chemotherapy and given as maintenance .
The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator - assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST , version 1 . 1 .
An additional efficacy endpoint was overall survival ( OS ) .
The median age of patients in both arms was 61 years overall ( range 26 to 87 ) .
Ovarian cancer was the primary tumor type in 86 % of patients in both arms .
Ninety six percent ( 96 % ) were serous histological type .
The ECOG performance score was 0 in 70 % of patients and 1 in 28 % of patients , overall .
All patients had received first - line platinum - based therapy and bevacizumab .
First - line treatment outcomes at screening indicated that patients had no evidence of disease with complete macroscopic resection at initial debulking surgery ( 32 % , both arms ) , no evidence of disease / CR with complete macroscopic resection at interval debulking surgery ( 31 % , both arms ) , no evidence of disease / CR in patients who had either incomplete resection ( at initial or interval debulking surgery ) or no debulking surgery ( 15 % , both arms ) and patients with a partial response ( 22 % , both arms ) .
Thirty percent ( 30 % ) of patients in both arms had a deleterious mutation .
Patients were not restricted by the surgical outcome with 65 % having complete cytoreduction at initial or interval debulking surgery and 35 % having residual macroscopic disease .
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between the study and placebo arms in the Intention to Treat ( ITT ) population and also in the HRD - positive subgroup .
Efficacy results from a biomarker subgroup analysis of 387 patients with HRD - positive tumors , identified post - randomization using the Myriad myChoice ® HRD Plus tumor test , who received Lynparza / bevacizumab ( n = 255 ) or placebo / bevacizumab ( n = 132 ) , are summarized in Table 19 and Figure 2 .
Results from a blinded independent review of PFS were consistent .
Overall survival data in this subpopulation were immature with 16 % deaths .

Patients were randomized to Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily or healthcare provider ’ s choice of chemotherapy ( capecitabine , eribulin , or vinorelbine , at standard doses ) until progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Randomization was stratified by prior use of chemotherapy for metastatic disease ( yes vs no ) , hormone receptor status ( hormone receptor positive vs triple negative ) , and previous use of platinum - based chemotherapy ( yes vs no ) .
The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS assessed by blinded independent central review ( BICR ) using RECIST version 1 . 1 .
A total of 302 patients were randomized , 205 to Lynparza and 97 to chemotherapy .
Among the 205 patients treated with Lynparza , the median age was 44 years ( range : 22 to 76 ) , 65 % were White , 4 % were males and all the patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 .
Approximately 50 % of patients had triple - negative tumors and 50 % had estrogen receptor and / or progesterone receptor positive tumors and the proportions were balanced across treatment arms .
Patients in each treatment arm had received a median of 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease ; approximately 30 % had not received a prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer .
Twenty - one percent of patients in the Lynparza arm and 14 % in the chemotherapy arm had received platinum therapy for metastatic disease .
Seven percent of patients in each treatment arm had received platinum therapy for localized disease .
Of the 302 patients randomized onto OlympiAD , 299 were tested with the BRACAnalysis CDx ® and 297 were confirmed to have deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm status ; 202 were randomized to the Lynparza arm and 95 to the healthcare provider ’ s choice of chemotherapy arm .
A statistically significant improvement in PFS was demonstrated for the Lynparza arm compared to the chemotherapy arm .
Efficacy data for OlympiAD are displayed in Table 24 and Figure 8 .
Consistent results were observed across patient subgroups defined by study stratification factors .
An exploratory analysis of investigator - assessed PFS was consistent with the BICR - assessed PFS results .

Figure 8 Kaplan - Meier Curves of Progression - Free Survival - OlympiAD [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 6 First - Line Maintenance Treatment of Germline BRCA - mutated Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma The efficacy of Lynparza was evaluated in POLO ( NCT02184195 ) , a randomized ( 3 : 2 ) , double - blind placebo - controlled , multi - center trial .
Patients were required to have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation ( gBRCAm ) and absence of disease progression after receipt of first - line platinum - based chemotherapy for at least 16 weeks .
Patients were randomized to receive Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS by BICR using RECIST , version 1 . 1 modified to assess patients with clinical complete response at entry who were assessed as having no evidence of disease unless they had progressed based on the appearance of new lesions .
Additional efficacy outcome measures were OS and ORR .
A total of 154 patients were randomized , 92 to Lynparza and 62 to placebo .
The median age was 57 years ( range 36 to 84 ) ; 54 % were male ; 92 % were White , 4 % were Asian , and 3 % were Black ; baseline ECOG PS was 0 ( 67 % ) or 1 ( 31 % ) .
The median time from initiation of first - line platinum - based chemotherapy to randomization was 5 . 8 months ( range 3 . 4 to 33 . 4 months ) .
Seventy - five percent ( 75 % ) of patients received FOLFIRINOX with a median of 9 cycles ( range 4 - 61 ) , 8 % received FOLFOX or XELOX , 4 % received GEMOX , and 3 % received gemcitabine plus cisplatin ; 49 % achieved a complete or partial response to platinum - based chemotherapy .
All patients had a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA - mutation as detected by the Myriad BRACAnalysis ® or BRACAnalysis CDx ® at a central laboratory only ( n = 106 ) , local BRCA test only ( n = 4 ) , or both local and central testing ( n = 44 ) .
Among the 150 patients with central test results , 30 % had a mutation in BRCA1 ; 69 % had a mutation in BRCA2 ; and 1 patient ( 1 % ) had mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 .
POLO demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in BICR - assessed PFS in patients randomized to Lynparza as compared with placebo .
The final analysis of OS did not reach statistical significance .
Efficacy results of POLO are provided in Table 25 and Figure 9 .

Figure 9 Kaplan - Meier Curves of BICR - Assessed Progression - Free Survival – POLO [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 7 HRR Gene - mutated Metastatic Castration - Resistant Prostate Cancer The efficacy of Lynparza was evaluated in PROfound ( NCT02987543 ) , randomized , open - label , multi - center trial that evaluated the efficacy of Lynparza 300 mg twice daily versus a comparator arm of investigator ’ s choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate in men with metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) .
All patients received a GnRH analog or had prior bilateral orchiectomy .
Patients needed to have progressed on prior enzalutamide or abiraterone for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer and / or CRPC and have a tumor mutation in one of 15 genes involved in the homologous recombination repair ( HRR ) pathway .
Patients were divided into two cohorts based on HRR gene mutation status .
Patients with mutations in either BRCA1 , BRCA2 , or ATM were randomized in Cohort A ; patients with mutations among 12 other genes involved in the HRR pathway ( BARD1 , BRIP1 , CDK12 , CHEK1 , CHEK2 , FANCL , PALB2 , PPP2R2A , RAD51B , RAD51C , RAD51D , or RAD54L ) were randomized in Cohort B ; patients with co - mutations ( BRCA1 , BRCA2 , or ATM plus a Cohort B gene ) were assigned to Cohort A . Although patients with PPP2R2A gene mutations were enrolled in the trial , Lynparza is not indicated for the treatment of patients with this gene mutation due to unfavorable risk - benefit .
Patients were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) , 256 to Lynparza arm and 131 to enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate arm ; in Cohort A there were 245 ( 162 Lynparza arm and 83 in enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate arm ) and in Cohort B there were 142 patients ( 94 in Lynparza arm and 48 in enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate arm ) .
Randomization was stratified by prior receipt of taxane chemotherapy and presence of measurable disease by RECIST 1 . 1 .
Treatment was continued until objective radiological disease progression determined by BICR .
Upon radiological progression confirmed by BICR , patients randomized to enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate were given the option to switch to Lynparza .
Patients with HRR gene mutations were identified by tissue - based testing using the Foundation Medicine FoundationOne ® clinical trial HRR assay performed at a central laboratory .
Determination of deleterious or suspected deleterious somatic or germline HRR mutation status in line with the FDA approved mutation classification and testing criteria for the Foundation Medicine F1CDx tissue - based assay and assessment of the germline - BRCA status using the Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx blood - based assay was performed retrospectively .
Representation of individual gene mutations by cohort is provided in Table 26 .
No patients were enrolled who had mutations in two of the 15 pre - specified HRR genes : FANCL and RAD51C .

[ 2 ] Lynparza is not indicated for patients with PPP2R2A mutations .
[ 3 ] Patients with co - occurring mutations ( BRCA1 , BRCA2 , or ATM plus a Cohort B gene ) were assigned to Cohort A .
In Cohort A + B , the median age was 69 years ( range : 47 to 91 years ) in both arms ; 69 % were White , 29 % were Asian , and 1 % were Black .
The ECOG performance score was 0 or 1 in most patients ( 95 % ) in both arms .
In patients treated with Lynparza , the proportion of patients with RECIST 1 . 1 measurable disease at baseline was 58 % , including 17 % with lung and 10 % with liver metastases , respectively .
At randomization , 66 % of patients had received prior taxane chemotherapy , 40 % had received enzalutamide , 38 % had received abiraterone acetate , and 20 % had received both enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate .
Patient characteristics were well - balanced between arms .
The major efficacy outcome of the study was radiological progression free survival ( rPFS ) ( Cohort A ) as determined by BICR using RECIST version 1 . 1 and Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 ( PCWG3 ) ( bone ) criteria .
Additional efficacy outcomes included confirmed objective response rate ( ORR ) ( Cohort A ) , rPFS ( combined Cohorts A + B ) as assessed by BICR , and overall survival ( OS ) ( Cohort A ) .
PROfound demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in BICR - assessed rPFS for Lynparza compared to investigator ’ s choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate in Cohort A and Cohort A + B .
In an exploratory analysis for patients in Cohort B , the median rPFS was 4 . 8 months for Lynparza vs 3 . 3 months for comparator with a HR of 0 . 88 ( 95 % CI 0 . 58 , 1 . 36 ) .
The major efficacy outcome was supported by a statistically significant improvement in ORR by BICR for patients with measurable disease at baseline in Cohort A .
In Cohort B , ORR by BICR was 3 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 5 , 12 . 7 ) in Lynparza treated patients and 8 . 3 % ( 95 % CI 1 . 0 , 27 . 0 ) in patients treated with enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate .
The final analysis of overall survival ( OS ) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients randomized to Lynparza compared to patients in the enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate arm in Cohort A . Efficacy results of PROfound are provided in Tables 27 and 28 and Figures 10 and 11 .

[ 2 ] The HR and CI were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for prior taxane use and measurable disease .
An HR < 1 favors Lynparza 300 mg bd .
[ 3 ] The analysis was performed using the log - rank test stratified by prior taxane use and measurable disease .
Figure 10 Kaplan - Meier Curves of BICR - Assessed Radiological Progression - Free Survival – PROfound – Cohort A [ MULTIMEDIA ] Consistent results were observed in exploratory analyses of rPFS for patients who received or did not receive prior taxane therapy and for those with germline - BRCA mutations identified using the Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx assay compared with those with BRCA mutations identified using the Foundation Medicine F1CDx assay .
Figure 11 Kaplan - Meier Curves of Overall Survival – PROfound – Cohort A [ MULTIMEDIA ] Response data by HRR mutations for patients in the Lynparza arm are presented in Table 28 .
In the comparator arm of Cohorts A and B , a total of three patients achieved a partial response , including one patient with an ATM mutation alone and 2 patients with co - occurring mutations ( one with PALB2 + PPP2R2A and one with CDK12 + PALB2 ) .
