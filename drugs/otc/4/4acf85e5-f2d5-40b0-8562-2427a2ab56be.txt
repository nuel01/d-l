lodoquinol lodoquinol is an antifungal and antibacterial agent .
Chemically , lodoquinol is [ 5 , 7 - diiodo - 8 - quinolinol ] with the molecular formula ( C9HsI2NO ) Hydrocortisone Hydrocortisone is an anti - inflammatory and antipruritic agent .
Chemically , hydrocortisone is [ Pregn - 4 - ene - 3 , 20 - dione , 11 , 17 , 21 - trihydroxy - , ( 11 B ) - ] with the molecular formula ( C21H300s ) CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hydrocortisone has anti - inflammatory , antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties .
While the mechanism of anti - inflammatory activity is unclear , there is evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in humans .
lodoquinol has both antifungal and antibacterial properties .
Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical steroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle , the integrity of the epidermal barrier and the use of occlusive dressings .
Hydrocortisone can be absorbed from normal intact skin .
Inflammation and / or other inflammatory disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption .
Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids .
Once absorbed throuah the skin .
hvdrocortisone is tetrahydrocortisone and tetrahydrocortisol .
These are excreted in the urine , mainly conjugated as glucuronides , together with a very small proportion of unchanged hydrocortisone .
There are no data available regarding the percutaneous absorption of iodoquinol ; however , following oral administration , 3 - 5 % of the dose was recovered in the urine as a glucuronide .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Based on a review of a related drug by the National Research Council and subsequent FDA classification for that drug , the indications are as follows : " Possibly " Effective : Contact or atopiC dermatitis ; impetiginized eczema ; nummular eczema ; endogenous chronic infectious dermatitis ; stasis dermatitis ; pyoderma ; nuchal eczema and chronic eczematoid otitis externa ; acne urticata ; localized or disseminated neurodermatitis ; lichen simplex chronicus ; anogenital pruritus ( vulvae , scroti , ani ) ; folliculitis ; bacterial dermatoses ; mycotic dermatoses such as tinea ( capitis , cruris , corporis , pedis ) ; monliasis ; intertrigo .
Final classification of the less - than - effective indications requires further investigation .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Alcortin is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone , iodoquinol , aloe vera , glycine , histidine , lysine , palmitic acid or any other components of the preparation .
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS For external use only .
Keep away from eyes .
If irritation develops , the use of Alcortin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
Staining of the skin , hair and fabrics may occur .
Not intended for use on infants or under diapers or occlusive dressings .
If extensive areas are treated or if the occlusive dressing technique is used , the possibility exists of increased systemic absorption of the corticosteroid , and suitable precautions should be taken .
Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity .
Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight - fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area , as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings .
lodoquinol may be absorbed through the skin and interfere with thyroid function tests .
If such tests are contemplated , wait at least one month after discontinuance of therapy to perform these tests .
The ferric chloride test for phenylketonuria ( PKU ) can yield a false positive res ! Jlt if iodoquinol is present in the diaper or urine .
Prolonged use may result in overgrowth of non - susceptible organisms requiring appropriate therapy .
Keep out of reach of children .
Burning , itching , irritation and dryness have been reported infrequently following the use of topical corticosteroids .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenisis and Impairment of Fertility : Long term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of the effect on fertility of hydrocortinegative results .
Mutagenicity studies have not been performed with iodoquinol .
Pregnancy Category C : Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with Alcortin .
It is not known whether Alcortin can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women or can affect reproductive capacity .
Alcortin should be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
