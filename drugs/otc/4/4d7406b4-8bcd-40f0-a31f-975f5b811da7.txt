Dear Medical Professional , Per your order , we have compounded Mebrofenin as a sterile solution .
The characteristics of this preparation are DESCRIPTION AnazaoHealth supplies compounded Mebrofenin for the preparation of Tc - 99 m Mebrofenin .
Each reaction vial contains 10 mg Mebrofenin and 0 . 2 mg tin as stannous chloride .
The vial is back filled with nitrogen gas after lyophilization .
The vial may contain a partial vacuum .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Technetium Tc - 99 m Mebrofenin by intravenous administration is indicated as a hepatic imaging agent , used in the diagnosis of liver disease DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The suggested intravenous dose range of Technetium Tc 99 m Mebrofenin in the average patient ( 70 kg ) is : Nonjaundiced patient : 74 - 185 MBq ( 2 - 5 mCi ) Patient with serum bilirubin level greater than 1 . 5 mg / dL : 111 - 370 MBq ( 3 - 10 mCi ) The patient should be in a fasting state , 4 hours is preferable .
False positives ( non - visualization ) may result if the gallbladder has been emptied by ingestion of food .
An interval of at least 24 hours should be allowed before repeat examination PREPARATION To prepare injection , follow this aseptic procedure : • Waterproof gloves should be worn during the preparation procedure .
• Snap off the plastic lid and place room temperature reaction vial in an appropriate lead shield .
• Swab the rubber closure of the vial with a germicide .
• Inject 1 – 3 ml Sterile additive free sodium pertechnetate Tc - 99 m injection containing up to 740 MBq ( 20 mCi ) into the vial .
Be sure to maintain inert atmosphere in vial by introducing as little air as possible during reconstitution .
NOTE : If sodium pertechnetate Tc - 99 m injection must be diluted , use only preservative free Sodium Chloride Injection USP .
• Secure the lead shield cover .
Swirl the vial gently to mix contents and let stand 3 to 5 minutes prior to use .
