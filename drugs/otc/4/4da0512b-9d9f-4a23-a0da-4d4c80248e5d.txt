5 . 2 Elevation of Blood Pressure Elevation in blood pressure from systemic absorption has been reported following conjunctival instillation of recommended doses of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution , 1 % .
5 . 3 Increased Adverse Drug Reaction Susceptibility with Certain Central Nervous System Conditions Individuals with Down syndrome , spastic paralysis , or brain damage are particularly susceptible to central nervous system disturbances , cardiopulmonary , and gastrointestinal toxicity from systemic absorption of atropine .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling : • Photophobia and Blurred Vision [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Elevation in Blood Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Increased Adverse Drug Reaction Susceptibility with Certain Central Nervous System Conditions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] The following adverse reactions have been identified following use of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .

6 . 1 Ocular Adverse Reactions Eye pain and stinging occurs upon instillation of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution .
Other commonly occurring adverse reactions include blurred vision , photophobia , superficial keratitis and decreased lacrimation .
Allergic reactions such as papillary conjunctivitis , contact dermatitis , and eyelid edema may also occur less commonly .
6 . 2 Systemic Adverse Reactions Systemic effects of atropine are related to its anti - muscarinic activity .
Systemic adverse events reported include dryness of skin , mouth , and throat from decreased secretions from mucus membranes ; drowsiness ; restlessness , irritability or delirium from stimulation of the central nervous system ; tachycardia ; flushed skin of the face and neck .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The use of atropine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) is generally not recommended because of the potential to precipitate hypertensive crisis .
( 7 ) 7 . 1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors The use of atropine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) is generally not recommended because of the potential to precipitate hypertensive crisis .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well - controlled studies with Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution , 1 % administration in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk .
Adequate animal development and reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine sulfate .
In humans , 1 % atropine sulfate is systemically bioavailable following topical ocular administration [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution , 1 % should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
8 . 2 Lactation There is no information to inform risk regarding the presence of atropine in human milk following ocular administration of Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution , 1 % to the mother .
The effects on breastfed infants and the effects on milk production are also unknown .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution , 1 % and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution , 1 % .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Due to the potential for systemic absorption of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution the use of Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution , 1 % in children under the age of 3 months is not recommended and the use in children under 3 years of age should be limited to no more than one drop per eye per day .
Safety and efficacy in children above the age of 3 months has been established in adequate and well controlled trials .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and adult patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of accidental ingestion or toxic overdosage with atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution supportive care may include a short acting barbiturate or diazepam as needed to control marked excitement and convulsions .
Large doses for sedation should be avoided because central depressant action may coincide with the depression occurring late in atropine poisoning .
Central stimulants are not recommended .
Physostigmine , given by slow intravenous injection of 1 to 4 mg ( 0 . 5 to 1 mg in pediatric populations ) , rapidly abolishes delirium and coma caused by large doses of atropine .
Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed , the patient may again lapse into coma after one to two hours , and repeated doses may be required .
Artifi cial respiration with oxygen may be necessary .
Cooling measures may be needed to help to reduce fever , especially in pediatric populations .
The fatal pediatric and adult doses of atropine are not known .
11 DESCRIPTION Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution , 1 % is a sterile topical ophthalmic solution .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Atropine acts as a competitive antagonist of the parasympathetic ( and sympathetic ) acetylcholine muscarinic receptors .
Topical atropine on the eye induces mydriasis by inhibiting contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle normally stimulated by acetylcholine .
This inhibition allows the countering radial pupillary dilator muscle to contract which results in dilation of the pupil .
Additionally , atropine induces cycloplegia by paralysis of the ciliary muscle which controls accommodation while viewing objects .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of action after administration of Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution , 1 % generally occurs in minutes with maximal effect seen in hours and the effect can last multiple days [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In a study of healthy subjects , after topical ocular administration of 30 μL of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution , 1 % , the mean ( ± SD ) systemic bioavailability of l - hyoscyamine was reported to be approximately 64 ± 29 % ( range 19 % to 95 % ) as compared to intravenous administration of atropine sulfate .
The mean ( ± SD ) time to maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) was approximately 28 ± 27 minutes ( range 3 to 60 minutes ) , and the mean ( ± SD ) peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) of l - hyoscyamine was 288 ± 73 pg / mL .
The mean ( ± SD ) plasma half - life was reported to be approximately 2 . 5 ± 0 . 8 hours .
In a separate study of patients undergoing ocular surgery , after topical ocular administration of 40 μL of atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution , 1 % , the mean ( ± SD ) plasma Cmax of l - hyoscyamine was 860 ± 402 pg / mL .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Atropine sulfate was negative in the Salmonella / microsome mutagenicity test .
Studies to evaluate carcinogenicity and impairment of fertility have not been conducted .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Topical administration of Atropine Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution , 1 % results in mydriasis and / or cycloplegia , with efficacy demonstrated in both adults and children .
The maximum effect for mydriasis is achieved in about 30 – 40 minutes after administration , with recovery after approximately 7 – 10 days .
The maximum effect for cycloplegia is achieved within 60 – 180 minutes after administration , with recovery after approximately 7 – 12 days .
