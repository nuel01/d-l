Bortezomib for Injection is a hazardous drug .
Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures . 1 2 . 10 Reconstitution / Preparation for Intravenous and Subcutaneous Administration Use proper aseptic technique .
Reconstitute only with 0 . 9 % sodium chloride .
The reconstituted product should be a clear and colorless solution .
Different volumes of 0 . 9 % sodium chloride are used to reconstitute the product for the different routes of administration .
The reconstituted concentration of bortezomib for subcutaneous administration ( 2 . 5 mg / mL ) is greater than the reconstituted concentration of bortezomib for intravenous administration ( 1 mg / mL ) .
Because each route of administration has a different reconstituted concentration , use caution when calculating the volume to be administered [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 9 ) ] .
For each 3 . 5 mg single - dose vial of bortezomib , reconstitute with the following volume of 0 . 9 % sodium chloride based on route of administration ( Table 7 ) : Table 7 : Reconstitution Volumes and Final Concentration for Intravenous and Subcutaneous Administration Route of Administration Bortezomib ( mg / vial ) Diluent ( 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride ) Final Bortezomib Concentration ( mg / mL ) Intravenous 3 . 5 mg 3 . 5 mL 1 mg / mL Subcutaneous 3 . 5 mg 1 . 4 mL 2 . 5 mg / mL Dose must be individualized to prevent overdosage .
After determining patient body surface area ( BSA ) in square meters , use the following equations to calculate the total volume ( mL ) of reconstituted Bortezomib for Injection to be administered : • Intravenous Administration [ 1 mg / mL concentration ] Bortezomib for Injection dose ( mg / m2 ) x patient BSA ( m2 ) = Total Bortezomib for Injection volume ( mL ) to be administered 1 mg / mL • Subcutaneous Administration [ 2 . 5 mg / mL concentration ] Bortezomib for Injection dose ( mg / m2 ) x patient BSA ( m2 ) = Total Bortezomib for Injection volume ( mL ) to be administered 2 . 5 mg / mL Stickers that indicate the route of administration are provided with each Bortezomib for Injection vial .
These stickers should be placed directly on the syringe of Bortezomib for Injection once Bortezomib for Injection is prepared to help alert practitioners of the correct route of administration for Bortezomib for Injection .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .

( 7 . 1 ) • Strong CYP3A4 Inducers : Avoid concomitant use .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on Bortezomib for Injection Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreases the exposure of bortezomib [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] which may decrease Bortezomib for Injection efficacy .
Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers .
Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases the exposure of bortezomib [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] which may increase the risk of bortezomib toxicities .
Monitor patients for signs of bortezomib toxicity and consider a bortezomib dose reduction if bortezomib must be given in combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors .
7 . 2 Drugs Without Clinically Significant Interactions with Bortezomib for Injection No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed when Bortezomib for Injection was coadministered with dexamethasone , omeprazole , or melphalan in combination with prednisone [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Patients with diabetes may require close monitoring of blood glucose and adjustment of antidiabetic medication .
( 8 . 8 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] and findings in animals , Bortezomib for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no studies with the use of Bortezomib for Injection in pregnant women to inform drug - associated risks .

8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients .
The activity and safety of Bortezomib for Injection in combination with intensive reinduction chemotherapy was evaluated in pediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies ( pre - B cell ALL 77 % , 16 % with T - cell ALL , and 7 % T - cell lymphoblastic lymphoma ( LL ) ) , all of whom relapsed within 36 months of initial diagnosis in a single - arm multicenter , nonrandomized cooperative group trial .
An effective reinduction multiagent chemotherapy regimen was administered in three blocks .
Block 1 included vincristine , prednisone , doxorubicin and pegaspargase ; Block 2 included cyclophosphamide , etoposide and methotrexate ; Block 3 included high - dose cytosine arabinoside and asparaginase .
Bortezomib for Injection was administered at a dose of 1 . 3 mg / m2 as a bolus intravenous injection on Days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 of Block 1 and Days 1 , 4 , and 8 of Block 2 .
There were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety .
The median age was ten years ( range : 1 to 26 ) , 57 % were male , 70 % were white , 14 % were black , 4 % were Asian , 2 % were American Indian / Alaska Native , 1 % were Pacific Islander .
The activity was evaluated in a prespecified subset of the first 60 evaluable patients enrolled on the study with pre - B ALL ≤ 21 years and relapsed < 36 months from diagnosis .
The complete remission ( CR ) rate at day 36 was compared to that in a historical control set of patients who had received the identical backbone therapy without Bortezomib for Injection .
There was no evidence that the addition of Bortezomib for Injection had any impact on the CR rate .
No new safety concerns were observed when Bortezomib for Injection was added to a chemotherapy backbone regimen as compared with a historical control group in which the backbone regimen was given without Bortezomib for Injection .
The BSA - normalized clearance of bortezomib in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 669 patients enrolled in the relapsed multiple myeloma study , 245 ( 37 % ) were 65 years of age or older : 125 ( 38 % ) on the Bortezomib for Injection arm and 120 ( 36 % ) on the dexamethasone arm .
Median time to progression and median duration of response for patients ≥ 65 were longer on Bortezomib for Injection compared to dexamethasone [ 5 . 5 mo vs 4 . 3 mo , and 8 . 0 mo vs 4 . 9 mo , respectively ] .
On the Bortezomib for Injection arm , 40 % ( n = 46 ) of evaluable patients aged ≥ 65 experienced response ( CR + PR ) vs 18 % ( n = 21 ) on the dexamethasone arm .
The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 events was 64 % , 78 % and 75 % for Bortezomib for Injection patients ≤ 50 , 51 to 64 and ≥ 65 years old , respectively [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients ≥ age 65 and younger patients receiving Bortezomib for Injection ; but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No starting dosage adjustment of Bortezomib for Injection is recommended for patients with renal impairment .
In patients requiring dialysis , Bortezomib for Injection should be administered after the dialysis procedure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No starting dosage adjustment of Bortezomib for Injection is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ 1 x ULN and AST > ULN , or total bilirubin > 1 to 1 . 5 x ULN and any AST ) .
The exposure of bortezomib is increased in patients with moderate ( total bilirubin ≥ 1 . 5 to 3 x ULN and any AST ) and severe ( total bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment .
Reduce the starting dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 8 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Patients with Diabetes During clinical trials , hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were reported in diabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycemics .
Patients on oral antidiabetic agents receiving Bortezomib for Injection treatment may require close monitoring of their blood glucose levels and adjustment of the dose of their antidiabetic medication .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known specific antidote for Bortezomib for Injection overdosage .
In humans , fatal outcomes following the administration of more than twice the recommended therapeutic dose have been reported , which were associated with the acute onset of symptomatic hypotension ( 5 . 2 ) and thrombocytopenia ( 5 . 7 ) .
In the event of an overdosage , the patient ' s vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care given .
Studies in monkeys and dogs showed that intravenous bortezomib doses as low as two times the recommended clinical dose on a mg / m2 basis were associated with increases in heart rate , decreases in contractility , hypotension , and death .
In dog studies , a slight increase in the corrected QT interval was observed at doses resulting in death .
In monkeys , doses of 3 . 0 mg / m2 and greater ( approximately twice the recommended clinical dose ) resulted in hypotension starting at one hour postadministration , with progression to death in 12 to 14 hours following drug administration .
11 DESCRIPTION Bortezomib for Injection , a proteasome inhibitor , contains bortezomib which is an antineoplastic agent .
Bortezomib is a modified dipeptidyl boronic acid .
The chemical name for bortezomib , the monomeric boronic acid , is [ ( 1 R ) - 3 - methyl - 1 - [ [ ( 2 S ) - 1 - oxo - 3 - phenyl - 2 - [ ( pyrazinylcarbonyl ) amino ] propyl ] amino ] butyl ] boronic acid .
Bortezomib has the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular weight is 384 . 24 .
The molecular formula is C19H25BN4O4 .
The solubility of bortezomib , as the monomeric boronic acid , in water is 3 . 3 to 3 . 8 mg / mL in a pH range of 2 to 6 . 5 .
Bortezomib for Injection is available for intravenous injection or subcutaneous use .
Each single - dose vial contains 3 . 5 mg of bortezomib as a sterile lyophilized powder .
It also contains the inactive ingredient : 35 mg mannitol , USP .
The product is provided as a mannitol boronic ester which , in reconstituted form , consists of the mannitol ester in equilibrium with its hydrolysis product , the monomeric boronic acid .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin - like activity of the 26 S proteasome in mammalian cells .
The 26 S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins .
The ubiquitin - proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins , thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells .
Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis , which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell .
This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death .
Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro .
Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models , including multiple myeloma .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg / m2 and 1 . 3 mg / m2 bortezomib doses , the maximum inhibition of 20 S proteasome activity ( relative to baseline ) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration .
Comparable maximum inhibition of 20 S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1 . 3 mg / m2 doses .
Maximal inhibition ranged from 70 % to 84 % and from 73 % to 83 % for the 1 mg / m2 and 1 . 3 mg / m2 dose regimens , respectively .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration of 1 mg / m2 and 1 . 3 mg / m2 doses , the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib ( Cmax ) after the first dose ( Day 1 ) were 57 and 112 ng / mL , respectively .
When administered twice weekly , the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng / mL for the 1 mg / m2 dose and 89 to 120 ng / mL for the 1 . 3 mg / m2 dose .
Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1 . 3 mg / m2 dose to patients with multiple myeloma , the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration ( AUClast ) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration .
The AUClast geometric mean ratio ( 90 % confidence interval ) was 0 . 99 ( 0 . 80 to 1 . 23 ) .
The Cmax after subcutaneous administration ( 20 . 4 ng / mL ) was lower than after intravenous administration ( 223 ng / mL ) with repeat dose administration .
Distribution The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L / m2 following single - or repeat - dose administration of 1 mg / m2 or 1 . 3 mg / m2 to patients with multiple myeloma .
The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83 % over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng / mL .
Elimination The mean elimination half - life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg / m2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1 . 3 mg / m2 dose .
The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L / h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg / m2 and 1 . 3 mg / m2 , respectively , and ranged from 15 to 32 L / h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1 . 3 mg / m2 , respectively .
Metabolism Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized to several inactive metabolites in vitro via cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes 3A4 , CYP2C19 , and CYP1A2 , and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 .
Excretion The pathways of elimination of bortezomib have not been characterized in humans .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were observed based on age , sex , or renal impairment ( including patients administered Bortezomib for Injection after dialysis ) .
The effect of race on bortezomib pharmacokinetics is unknown .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following administration of bortezomib doses ranging from 0 . 5 to 1 . 3 mg / m2 , mild ( total bilirubin ≤ 1 x ULN and AST > ULN , or total bilirubin > 1 to 1 . 5 x ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment did not alter dose - normalized bortezomib AUC when compared to patients with normal hepatic function .
Dose normalized mean bortezomib AUC increased by approximately 60 % in patients with moderate ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 x ULN and any AST ) or severe ( total bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment .
A lower starting dose is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant differences in bortezomib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with dexamethasone ( weak CYP3A4 inducer ) , omeprazole ( strong CYP2C19 inhibitor ) , or melphalan in combination with prednisone .
Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor Coadministration with ketoconazole ( strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ) increased bortezomib exposure by 35 % .
Strong CYP3A4 Inducer Coadministration with rifampin ( strong CYP3A4 inducer ) decreased bortezomib exposure by approximately 45 % .
In Vitro Studies Bortezomib may inhibit CYP2C19 activity and increase exposure to drugs that are substrates for this enzyme .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with bortezomib .

Fertility studies with bortezomib were not performed but evaluation of reproductive tissues has been performed in the general toxicity studies .
In the six month rat toxicity study , degenerative effects in the ovary were observed at doses ≥ 0 . 3 mg / m2 ( one - fourth of the recommended clinical dose ) , and degenerative changes in the testes occurred at 1 . 2 mg / m2 .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Cardiovascular Toxicity Studies in monkeys showed that administration of dosages approximately twice the recommended clinical dose resulted in heart rate elevations , followed by profound progressive hypotension , bradycardia , and death 12 to 14 hours postdose .
Doses ≥ 1 . 2 mg / m2 induced dose - proportional changes in cardiac parameters .
Bortezomib has been shown to distribute to most tissues in the body , including the myocardium .

14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Multiple Myeloma Randomized , Open - Label Clinical Study in Patients with Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma A prospective , international , randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , open - label clinical study ( NCT00111319 ) of 682 patients was conducted to determine whether Bortezomib for Injection administered intravenously ( 1 . 3 mg / m2 ) in combination with melphalan ( 9 mg / m2 ) and prednisone ( 60 mg / m2 ) resulted in improvement in time to progression ( TTP ) when compared to melphalan ( 9 mg / m2 ) and prednisone ( 60 mg / m2 ) in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma .
Treatment was administered for a maximum of nine cycles ( approximately 54 weeks ) and was discontinued early for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Antiviral prophylaxis was recommended for patients on the Bortezomib for Injection study arm .
The median age of the patients in the study was 71 years ( 48 ; 91 ) , 50 % were male , 88 % were Caucasian and the median Karnofsky performance status score for the patients was 80 ( 60 ; 100 ) .
Patients had IgG / IgA / Light chain myeloma in 63 % / 25 % / 8 % instances , a median hemoglobin of 105 g / L ( 64 ; 165 ) , and a median platelet count of 221 , 500 / microliter ( 33 , 000 ; 587 , 000 ) .
Efficacy results for the trial are presented in Table 14 .
At a prespecified interim analysis ( with median follow - up of 16 . 3 months ) , the combination of Bortezomib for Injection , melphalan and prednisone therapy resulted in significantly superior results for time to progression , progression - free survival , overall survival and response rate .
Further enrollment was halted , and patients receiving melphalan and prednisone were offered Bortezomib for Injection in addition .
A later , prespecified analysis of overall survival ( with median follow - up of 36 . 7 months with a hazard ratio of 0 . 65 , 95 % CI : 0 . 51 , 0 . 84 ) resulted in a statistically significant survival benefit for the Bortezomib for Injection , melphalan and prednisone treatment arm despite subsequent therapies including Bortezomib for Injection based regimens .
In an updated analysis of overall survival based on 387 deaths ( median follow - up 60 . 1 months ) , the median overall survival for the Bortezomib for Injection , melphalan and prednisone treatment arm was 56 . 4 months and for the melphalan and prednisone treatment arm was 43 . 1 months , with a hazard ratio of 0 . 695 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 57 , 0 . 85 ) .

Patients considered to be refractory to prior high - dose dexamethasone were excluded as were those with baseline Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy or platelet counts < 50 , 000 / μL .
A total of 627 patients were evaluable for response .
Stratification factors were based on the number of lines of prior therapy the patient had previously received ( one previous line vs more than one line of therapy ) , time of progression relative to prior treatment ( progression during or within six months of stopping their most recent therapy vs relapse > 6 months after receiving their most recent therapy ) , and screening beta2 - microglobulin levels ( ≤ 2 . 5 mg / L vs > 2 . 5 mg / L ) .
Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 15 .

Patients achieving a CR were treated for four cycles beyond first evidence of CR .
Within each three week treatment cycle , Bortezomib for Injection 1 . 3 mg / m2 / dose alone was administered by intravenous bolus twice weekly for two weeks on Days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 followed by a ten day rest period ( Days 12 to 21 ) .
Within each five week treatment cycle , Bortezomib for Injection 1 . 3 mg / m2 / dose alone was administered by intravenous bolus once weekly for four weeks on Days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 followed by a 13 day rest period ( Days 23 to 35 ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Patients in the dexamethasone treatment group were to receive 4 , five week treatment cycles followed by 5 , four week treatment cycles .
Within each five week treatment cycle , dexamethasone 40 mg / day PO was administered once daily on Days 1 to 4 , 9 to 12 , and 17 to 20 followed by a 15 day rest period ( Days 21 to 35 ) .
Within each four week treatment cycle , dexamethasone 40 mg / day PO was administered once daily on Days 1 to 4 followed by a 24 day rest period ( Days 5 to 28 ) .
Patients with documented progressive disease on dexamethasone were offered Bortezomib for Injection at a standard dose and schedule on a companion study .
Following a preplanned interim analysis of time to progression , the dexamethasone arm was halted and all patients randomized to dexamethasone were offered Bortezomib for Injection , regardless of disease status .
In the Bortezomib for Injection arm , 34 % of patients received at least one Bortezomib for Injection dose in all eight of the three week cycles of therapy , and 13 % received at least one dose in all 11 cycles .
The average number of Bortezomib for Injection doses during the study was 22 , with a range of 1 to 44 .
In the dexamethasone arm , 40 % of patients received at least one dose in all four of the five week treatment cycles of therapy , and 6 % received at least one dose in all nine cycles .
The time to event analyses and response rates from the relapsed multiple myeloma study are presented in Table 16 .
Response and progression were assessed using the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation ( EBMT ) criteria .
Complete response ( CR ) required < 5 % plasma cells in the marrow , 100 % reduction in M - protein , and a negative immunofixation test ( IF - ) .
Partial response ( PR ) requires ≥ 50 % reduction in serum myeloma protein and ≥ 90 % reduction of urine myeloma protein on at least two occasions for a minimum of at least six weeks along with stable bone disease and normal calcium .
Near complete response ( nCR ) was defined as meeting all the criteria for complete response including 100 % reduction in M - protein by protein electrophoresis ; however , M - protein was still detectable by immunofixation ( IF + ) .

Figure 3 : Time to Progression Bortezomib vs Dexamethasone ( Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Study ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] As shown in Figure 4 , Bortezomib for Injection had a significant survival advantage relative to dexamethasone ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
The median follow - up was 8 . 3 months .
Figure 4 : Overall Survival Bortezomib vs Dexamethasone ( Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Study ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] For the 121 patients achieving a response ( CR or PR ) on the Bortezomib for Injection arm , the median duration was 8 . 0 months ( 95 % CI : 6 . 9 , 11 . 5 months ) compared to 5 . 6 months ( 95 % CI : 4 . 8 , 9 . 2 months ) for the 56 responders on the dexamethasone arm .
The response rate was significantly higher on the Bortezomib for Injection arm regardless of beta2 - microglobulin levels at baseline .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Randomized , Open - Label Clinical Study of Bortezomib for Injection Subcutaneous vs Intravenous in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma An open - label , randomized , Phase 3 noninferiority study ( NCT00722566 ) compared the efficacy and safety of the subcutaneous administration of Bortezomib for Injection vs the intravenous administration .
This study included 222 bortezomib naïve patients with relapsed multiple myeloma , who were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to receive 1 . 3 mg / m2 of Bortezomib for Injection by either the subcutaneous ( n = 148 ) or intravenous ( n = 74 ) route for eight cycles .
Patients who did not obtain an optimal response ( less than Complete Response ( CR ) ) to therapy with Bortezomib for Injection alone after four cycles were allowed to receive oral dexamethasone 20 mg daily on the day of and after Bortezomib for Injection administration ( 82 patients in subcutaneous treatment group and 39 patients in the intravenous treatment group ) .
Patients with baseline Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain , or platelet counts < 50 , 000 / μL were excluded .
A total of 218 patients were evaluable for response .
Stratification factors were based on the number of lines of prior therapy the patient had received ( one previous line vs more than one line of therapy ) , and international staging system ( ISS ) stage ( incorporating beta2 - microglobulin and albumin levels ; Stages I , II , or III ) .
The baseline demographic and other characteristics of the two treatment groups are summarized as follows : the median age of the patient population was approximately 64 years of age ( range : 38 to 88 years ) , primarily male ( subcutaneous : 50 % , intravenous : 64 % ) ; the primary type of myeloma is IgG ( subcutaneous : 65 % IgG , 26 % IgA , 8 % light chain ; intravenous : 72 % IgG , 19 % IgA , 8 % light chain ) , ISS staging I / II / III ( % ) was 27 , 41 , 32 for both subcutaneous and intravenous , Karnofsky performance status score was ≤ 70 % in 22 % of subcutaneous and 16 % of intravenous , creatinine clearance was 67 . 5 mL / min in subcutaneous and 73 mL / min in intravenous , the median years from diagnosis was 2 . 68 and 2 . 93 in subcutaneous and intravenous respectively and the proportion of patients with more than one prior line of therapy was 38 % in subcutaneous and 35 % in intravenous .
This study met its primary ( noninferiority ) objective that single agent subcutaneous Bortezomib for Injection retains at least 60 % of the overall response rate after four cycles relative to single agent intravenous Bortezomib for Injection .

The median duration of time between diagnosis of multiple myeloma and first dose of Bortezomib for Injection on this trial was two years , and patients had received a median of one prior line of treatment ( median of three prior therapies ) .
A single complete response was seen at each dose .
The overall response rates ( CR + PR ) were 30 % ( 8 / 27 ) at 1 mg / m2 and 38 % ( 10 / 26 ) at 1 . 3 mg / m2 .
A Phase 2 Open - Label Extension Study in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Patients from the two Phase 2 studies , who in the investigators ' opinion would experience additional clinical benefit , continued to receive Bortezomib for Injection beyond 8 cycles on an extension study .
Sixty - three ( 63 ) patients from the Phase 2 multiple myeloma studies were enrolled and received a median of seven additional cycles of Bortezomib for Injection therapy for a total median of 14 cycles ( range : 7 to 32 ) .
The overall median dosing intensity was the same in both the parent protocol and extension study .
Sixty - seven percent ( 67 % ) of patients initiated the extension study at the same or higher dose intensity at which they completed the parent protocol , and 89 % of patients maintained the standard three week dosing schedule during the extension study .
No new cumulative or new long - term toxicities were observed with prolonged Bortezomib for Injection treatment [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
A Single - Arm Trial of Retreatment in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma A single - arm , open - label trial ( NCT00431769 ) was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of retreatment with Bortezomib for Injection .
One hundred and thirty patients ( ≥ 18 years of age ) with multiple myeloma who previously had at least partial response on a Bortezomib for Injection - containing regimen ( median of two prior lines of therapy [ range : 1 to 7 ] ) were retreated upon progression with Bortezomib for Injection administered intravenously .
Patients were excluded from trial participation if they had peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain of Grade ≥ 2 .
At least six months after prior Bortezomib for Injection therapy , Bortezomib for Injection was restarted at the last tolerated dose of 1 . 3 mg / m2 ( n = 93 ) or ≤ 1 mg / m2 ( n = 37 ) and given on Days 1 , 4 , 8 and 11 every three weeks for maximum of eight cycles either as single agent or in combination with dexamethasone in accordance with the standard of care .
Dexamethasone was administered in combination with Bortezomib for Injection to 83 patients in Cycle 1 with an additional 11 patients receiving dexamethasone during the course of Bortezomib for Injection retreatment cycles .
The primary endpoint was best confirmed response to retreatment as assessed by European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation ( EBMT ) criteria .
Fifty of the 130 patients achieved a best confirmed response of Partial Response or better for an overall response rate of 38 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : 30 . 1 , 47 . 4 ) .
One patient achieved a Complete Response and 49 achieved Partial Response .
In the 50 responding patients , the median duration of response was 6 . 5 months and the range was 0 . 6 to 19 . 3 months .
14 . 2 Mantle Cell Lymphoma A Randomized , Open - Label Clinical Study in Patients with Previously Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma A randomized , open - label , Phase 3 study ( NCT00722137 ) was conducted in 487 adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma ( Stage II , III or IV ) who were ineligible or not considered for bone marrow transplantation to determine whether Bortezomib for Injection administered in combination with rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , and prednisone ( VcR - CAP ) resulted in improvement in progression - free survival ( PFS ) when compared to the combination of rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone ( R - CHOP ) .
This clinical study utilized independent pathology confirmation and independent radiologic response assessment .
Patients in the VcR - CAP treatment arm received Bortezomib for Injection ( 1 . 3 mg / m2 ) administered intravenously on Days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 ( rest period Days 12 to 21 ) ; rituximab ( 375 mg / m2 ) on Day 1 ; cyclophosphamide ( 750 mg / m2 ) on Day 1 ; doxorubicin ( 50 mg / m2 ) on Day 1 ; and prednisone ( 100 mg / m2 ) on Day 1 through Day 5 of the 21 day treatment cycle .
For patients with a response first documented at Cycle 6 , two additional treatment cycles were allowed .
Median patient age was 66 years , 74 % were male , 66 % were Caucasian and 32 % were Asian .
Sixty - nine percent of patients had a positive bone marrow aspirate and / or a positive bone marrow biopsy for MCL , 54 % of patients had an International Prognostic Index ( IPI ) score of three ( high - intermediate ) or higher and 76 % had Stage IV disease .
The majority of the patients in both groups received six or more cycles of treatment , 84 % in the VcR - CAP group and 83 % in the R - CHOP group .
Median number of cycles received by patients in both treatment arms was six with 17 % of patients in the R - CHOP group and 14 % of subjects in the VcR - CAP group receiving up to two additional cycles .
The efficacy results for PFS , CR and ORR with a median follow - up of 40 months are presented in Table 18 .
The response criteria used to assess efficacy were based on the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non - Hodgkin ' s Lymphoma ( IWRC ) .
Final overall survival results at a median follow - up of 78 . 5 months are also presented in Table 18 and Figure 6 .
The combination of VcR - CAP resulted in statistically significant prolongation of PFS compared with R - CHOP ( see Table 18 , Figure 5 ) .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] A Phase 2 Single - Arm Clinical Study in Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma after Prior Therapy The safety and efficacy of Bortezomib for Injection in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma were evaluated in an open - label , single - arm , multicenter study ( NCT00063713 ) of 155 patients with progressive disease who had received at least one prior therapy .
The median age of the patients was 65 years ( 42 , 89 ) , 81 % were male , and 92 % were Caucasian .
Of the total , 75 % had one or more extra - nodal sites of disease , and 77 % were Stage 4 .
In 91 % of the patients , prior therapy included all of the following : an anthracycline or mitoxantrone , cyclophosphamide , and rituximab .
A total of thirty - seven percent ( 37 % ) of patients were refractory to their last prior therapy .
An intravenous bolus injection of Bortezomib for Injection 1 . 3 mg / m2 / dose was administered twice weekly for two weeks on Days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 followed by a ten day rest period ( Days 12 to 21 ) for a maximum of 17 treatment cycles .
Patients achieving a CR or CRu were treated for four cycles beyond first evidence of CR or CRu .
The study employed dose modifications for toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 , 2 . 7 ) ] .
Responses to Bortezomib for Injection are shown in Table 19 .
Response rates to Bortezomib for Injection were determined according to the International Workshop Response Criteria ( IWRC ) based on independent radiologic review of CT scans .
The median number of cycles administered across all patients was four ; in responding patients the median number of cycles was eight .
The median time to response was 40 days ( range : 31 to 204 days ) .
The median duration of follow - up was more than 13 months .
