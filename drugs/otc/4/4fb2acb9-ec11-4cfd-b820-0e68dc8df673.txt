5 % Dextrose Injection , USP ADD - VantageTM Diluent Flexible Plastic Container Rx only DESCRIPTION 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP solution is sterile and nonpyrogenic .
It is a parenteral solution containing 50 mg / mL of dextrose , hydrous in water for injection and is intended for intravenous administration after admixing with an ADD - Vantage vial , or single - dose powdered drug vials with 20 mm closure using the ADD - Vantage ADDAPTORTM ( WARNING : DO NOT USE WITH CHEMOTHERAPY AGENTS ) .
The solution contains no bacteriostat , antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended only as a single - dose injection .
When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded .
The solution is slightly hypotonic ( 253 mOsmol / liter ; calc . )
in relation to the extracellular fluid ( approx .
280 mOsmol / liter ) .
The pH of the solution is 4 . 3 ( 3 . 2 - 6 . 5 ) .
The solution is a parenteral fluid and nutrient replenisher .
Dextrose , USP is chemically designated D - glucose , monohydrate ( C6H12O6 • H2O ) , a hexose sugar freely soluble in water .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H2O .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts ; however , biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When administered intravenously , this solution provides a source of water and carbohydrate .
Solutions containing carbohydrate in the form of dextrose restore blood glucose levels and provide calories .
Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may aid in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein - sparing action .
Dextrose injected parenterally undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide and water .
Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirements range from two to three liters ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms .
Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium ( Na + ) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Intravenous solutions containing dextrose are indicated for parenteral replenishment of fluid and minimal carbohydrate calories as required by the clinical condition of the patient .
In this dosage form , 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP is intended to be used as a diluent for the contents of an ADD - Vantage vial , or single - dose vials with 20 mm closure using the ADD - Vantage ADDAPTORTM .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Dextrose Injection without electrolytes should not be administered simultaneously with blood through the same infusion set because of the possibility that pseudoagglutination of red cells may occur .
WARNINGS Excessive administration of potassium - free solutions may result in significant hypokalemia .
The intravenous administration of these solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered parenteral solutions .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of such solutions .
PRECAUTIONS Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations and acid - base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus .
Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged .
Discard unused portion .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Studies with solutions from ADD - Vantage flexible plastic containers have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effects on fertility .
Pregnancy : Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with dextrose .
It is also not known whether dextrose can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Dextrose should only be given to a pregnant woman if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when solutions from ADD - Vantage flexible containers are administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use : The safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population are based on the similarity of the clinical conditions of the pediatric and adult populations .
In neonates or very small infants the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance .
Frequent monitoring of serum glucose concentrations is required when dextrose is prescribed to pediatric patients , particularly neonates and low birth weight infants .
In very low birth weight infants , excessive or rapid administration of dextrose injection may result in increased serum osmolarity and possible intracerebral hemorrhage .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of overhydration or solute overload , re - evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures .
See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and ADVERSE REACTIONS .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose is dependent on the age , weight and clinical condition of the patient .
As reported in the literature , the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients , particularly neonates and low birth weight infants , because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia / hypoglycemia .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
See PRECAUTIONS .

To Open : Peel overwrap at corner and remove solution container .
Use unit within 30 days of opening overwrap , as long as the use date does not exceed the printed expiration date .
Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed .
This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety .
The opacity will diminish gradually .
To Assemble Vial and Flexible Diluent Container : ( Use Aseptic Technique ) • 1 .
Remove the protective covers from the top of the vial and the vial port on the diluent container as follows : • a . To remove the breakaway vial cap , swing the pull ring over the top of the vial and pull down far enough to start the opening ( SEE FIGURE 1 . )
, then pull straight up to remove the cap .
( SEE FIGURE 2 . )
NOTE : Once the breakaway cap has been removed , do not access vial with syringe .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Fig . 1 Fig .
2 • • b . To remove the vial port cover , grasp the tab on the pull ring , pull up to break the three tie strings , then pull back to remove the cover .
( SEE FIGURE 3 . )
• 2 .
Screw the vial into the vial port until it will go no further .
THE VIAL MUST BE SCREWED IN TIGHTLY TO ASSURE A SEAL .
This occurs approximately 1 / 2 turn ( 180 ° ) after the first audible click .
( SEE FIGURE 4 . )
The clicking sound does not assure a seal ; the vial must be turned as far as it will go .
NOTE : Once vial is seated , do not attempt to remove .
( SEE FIGURE 4 . )
• 3 .
Recheck the vial to assure that it is tight by trying to turn it further in the direction of assembly .
• 4 .
Label appropriately .
