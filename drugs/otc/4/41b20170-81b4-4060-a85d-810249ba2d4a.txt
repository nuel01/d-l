DESCRIPTION Rifabutin Capsules USP for oral administration contain 150 mg of the rifamycin antimycobacterial agent rifabutin , USP , per capsule , along with the inactive ingredients crospovidone , gelatin , iron oxide red , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , potassium hydroxide , shellac , silicon dioxide , sodium lauryl sulphate , and titanium dioxide .
The chemical name for rifabutin is 1 ' , 4 - didehydro - 1 - deoxy - 1 , 4 - dihydro - 5 ' - ( 2 - methylpropyl ) - 1 - oxorifamycin XIV ( Chemical Abstracts Service , 9 th Collective Index ) or ( 9 S , 12 E , 14 S , 15 R , 16 S , 17 R , 18 R , 19 R , 20 S , 21 S , 22 E , 24 Z ) - 6 , 16 , 18 , 20 - tetrahydroxy - 1 ' - isobutyl - 14 - methoxy - 7 , 9 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 25 - heptamethyl - spiro [ 9 , 4 - ( epoxypentadeca [ 1 , 11 , 13 ] trienimino ) - 2 H - furo [ 2 ' , 3 ' : 7 , 8 ] naphth [ 1 , 2 - d ] imidazole - 2 , 4 ' - piperidine ] - 5 , 10 , 26 - ( 3 H , 9 H ) - trione - 16 - acetate .
Rifabutin has a molecular formula of C46H62N4O11 , a molecular weight of 847 . 02 and the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Rifabutin is a red - violet powder soluble in chloroform and methanol , sparingly soluble in ethanol , and very slightly soluble in water ( 0 . 19 mg / mL ) .
Its log P value ( the base 10 logarithm of the partition coefficient between n - octanol and water ) is 3 . 2 ( n - octanol / water ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single oral dose of 300 mg to nine healthy adult volunteers , rifabutin was readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with mean ( ± SD ) peak plasma levels ( Cmax ) of 375 ( ± 267 ) ng / mL ( range : 141 to 1033 ng / mL ) attained in 3 . 3 ( ± 0 . 9 ) hours ( Tmax range : 2 to 4 hours ) .
Absolute bioavailability assessed in five HIV - positive patients , who received both oral and intravenous doses , averaged 20 % .
Total recovery of radioactivity in the urine indicates that at least 53 % of the orally administered rifabutin dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract .
The bioavailability of rifabutin from the capsule dosage form , relative to an oral solution , was 85 % in 12 healthy adult volunteers .
High - fat meals slow the rate without influencing the extent of absorption from the capsule dosage form .
Plasma concentrations post - Cmax declined in an apparent biphasic manner .
Pharmacokinetic dose - proportionality was established over the 300 mg to 600 mg dose range in nine healthy adult volunteers ( crossover design ) and in 16 early symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - positive patients over a 300 mg to 900 mg dose range .
Distribution Due to its high lipophilicity , rifabutin demonstrates a high propensity for distribution and intracellular tissue uptake .
Following intravenous dosing , estimates of apparent steady - state distribution volume ( 9 . 3 ± 1 . 5 L / kg ) in five HIV - positive patients exceeded total body water by approximately 15 - fold .
Substantially higher intracellular tissue levels than those seen in plasma have been observed in both rat and man .
The lung - to - plasma concentration ratio , obtained at 12 hours , was approximately 6 . 5 in four surgical patients who received an oral dose .
Mean rifabutin steady - state trough levels ( Cp , minss ; 24 - hour post - dose ) ranged from 50 to 65 ng / mL in HIV - positive patients and in healthy adult volunteers .
About 85 % of the drug is bound in a concentration - independent manner to plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0 . 05 to 1 mcg / mL .
Binding does not appear to be influenced by renal or hepatic dysfunction .
Rifabutin was slowly eliminated from plasma in seven healthy adult volunteers , presumably because of distribution - limited elimination , with a mean terminal half - life of 45 ( ± 17 ) hours ( range : 16 to 69 hours ) .
Although the systemic levels of rifabutin following multiple dosing decreased by 38 % , its terminal half - life remained unchanged .
Metabolism Of the five metabolites that have been identified , 25 - O - desacetyl and 31 - hydroxy are the most predominant , and show a plasma metabolite : parent area under the curve ratio of 0 . 10 and 0 . 07 , respectively .
The former has an activity equal to the parent drug and contributes up to 10 % to the total antimicrobial activity .
Excretion A mass - balance study in three healthy adult volunteers with 14 C - labeled rifabutin showed that 53 % of the oral dose was excreted in the urine , primarily as metabolites .
About 30 % of the dose is excreted in the feces .
Mean systemic clearance ( CLs / F ) in healthy adult volunteers following a single oral dose was 0 . 69 ( ± 0 . 32 ) L / hr / kg ( range : 0 . 46 to 1 . 34 L / hr / kg ) .
Renal and biliary clearance of unchanged drug each contribute approximately 5 % to CLs / F .
Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Geriatric Compared to healthy volunteers , steady - state kinetics of rifabutin are more variable in elderly patients ( > 70 years ) .
Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of rifabutin have not been studied in subjects under 18 years of age .
Renal Impairment The disposition of rifabutin ( 300 mg ) was studied in 18 patients with varying degrees of renal function .
Area under plasma concentration time curve ( AUC ) increased by about 71 % in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance below 30 mL / min ) compared to patients with creatinine clearance ( Crcl ) between 61 to 74 mL / min .
In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment ( Crcl between 30 to 61 mL / min ) , the AUC increased by about 41 % .
In patients with severe renal impairment , carefully monitor for rifabutin associated adverse events .
A reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended for patients with Crcl < 30 mL / min if toxicity is suspected ( see Dosage and Administration ) .
Hepatic Impairment Mild hepatic impairment does not require a dose modification .
The pharmacokinetics of rifabutin in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is not known .
Malabsorption in HIV - Infected Patients Alterations in gastric pH due to progressing HIV disease has been linked with malabsorption of some drugs used in HIV - positive patients ( e . g . , rifampin , isoniazid ) .
Drug serum concentrations data from AIDS patients with varying disease severity ( based on CD4 + counts ) suggests that rifabutin absorption is not influenced by progressing HIV disease .
Drug - Drug Interactions ( see also Precautions - Drug Interactions ) Multiple dosing of rifabutin has been associated with induction of hepatic metabolic enzymes of the CYP3A subfamily .
Rifabutin ' s predominant metabolite ( 25 - desacetyl rifabutin : LM565 ) , may also contribute to this effect .
Metabolic induction due to rifabutin is likely to produce a decrease in plasma concentrations of concomitantly administered drugs that are primarily metabolized by the CYP3A enzymes .
Similarly concomitant medications that competitively inhibit the CYP3A activity may increase plasma concentrations of rifabutin .
CLINICAL STUDIES Two randomized , double - blind clinical trials ( Study 023 and Study 027 ) compared rifabutin ( 300 mg / day ) to placebo in patients with CDC - defined AIDS and CD4 counts ≤ 200 cells / µL .
These studies accrued patients from 2 / 90 through 2 / 92 .
Study 023 enrolled 590 patients , with a median CD4 cell count at study entry of 42 cells / µL ( mean 61 ) .
Study 027 enrolled 556 patients with a median CD4 cell count at study entry of 40 cells / µL ( mean 58 ) .
Endpoints included the following : ( 1 ) MAC bacteremia , defined as at least one blood culture positive for Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) bacteria .
( 2 ) Clinically significant disseminated MAC disease , defined as MAC bacteremia accompanied by signs or symptoms of serious MAC infection , including one or more of the following : fever , night sweats , rigors , weight loss , worsening anemia , and / or elevations in alkaline phosphatase .
( 3 ) Survival .
MAC Bacteremia Participants who received rifabutin were one - third to one - half as likely to develop MAC bacteremia as were participants who received placebo .
These results were statistically significant ( Study 023 : p < 0 . 001 ; Study 027 : p = 0 . 002 ) .
In Study 023 , the one - year cumulative incidence of MAC bacteremia , on an intent to treat basis , was 9 % for patients randomized to rifabutin and 22 % for patients randomized to placebo .
In Study 027 , these rates were 13 % and 28 % for patients receiving rifabutin and placebo , respectively .
Most cases of MAC bacteremia ( approximately 90 % in these studies ) occurred among participants whose CD4 count at study entry was ≤ 100 cells / µL .
The median and mean CD4 counts at onset of MAC bacteremia were 13 cells / µL and 24 cells / µL , respectively .
These studies did not investigate the optimal time to begin MAC prophylaxis .
Clinically Significant Disseminated MAC Disease In association with the decreased incidence of bacteremia , patients on rifabutin showed reductions in the signs and symptoms of disseminated MAC disease , including fever , night sweats , weight loss , fatigue , abdominal pain , anemia , and hepatic dysfunction .
Survival The one - year survival rates in Study 023 were 77 % for the group receiving rifabutin and 77 % for the placebo group .
In Study 027 , the one - year survival rates were 77 % for the group receiving rifabutin and 70 % for the placebo group .
These differences were not statistically significant .
Microbiology Mechanism of Action Rifabutin inhibits DNA - dependent RNA polymerase in susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis but not in mammalian cells .
In resistant strains of E . coli , rifabutin , like rifampin , did not inhibit this enzyme .
It is not known whether rifabutin inhibits DNA - dependent RNA polymerase in Mycobacterium avium or in M . intracellulare which comprise M . avium complex ( MAC ) .
Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug , please see : https : / / www . fda . gov / STIC .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Rifabutin capsules USP are indicated for the prevention of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) disease in patients with advanced HIV infection .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Rifabutin capsules are contraindicated in patients who have had clinically significant hypersensitivity to rifabutin or to any other rifamycins .
WARNINGS Tuberculosis Rifabutin capsules must not be administered for MAC prophylaxis to patients with active tuberculosis .
Patients who develop complaints consistent with active tuberculosis while on prophylaxis with rifabutin should be evaluated immediately , so that those with active disease may be given an effective combination regimen of anti - tuberculosis medications .
Administration of rifabutin as a single agent to patients with active tuberculosis is likely to lead to the development of tuberculosis that is resistant both to rifabutin and to rifampin .
There is no evidence that rifabutin is an effective prophylaxis against M . tuberculosis .
Patients requiring prophylaxis against both M . tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex may be given isoniazid and rifabutin concurrently .
Tuberculosis in HIV - positive patients is common and may present with atypical or extrapulmonary findings .
Patients are likely to have a nonreactive purified protein derivative ( PPD ) despite active disease .
In addition to chest X - ray and sputum culture , the following studies may be useful in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the HIV - positive patient : blood culture , urine culture , or biopsy of a suspicious lymph node .
MAC Treatment with Clarithromycin When rifabutin is used concomitantly with clarithromycin for MAC treatment , a decreased dose of rifabutin is recommended due to the increase in plasma concentrations of rifabutin ( see Precautions - Drug Interactions , Table 2 ) .
Hypersensitivity and Related Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions may occur in patients receiving rifamycins .
Signs and symptoms of these reactions may include hypotension , urticaria , angioedema , acute bronchospasm , conjunctivitis , thrombocytopenia , neutropenia or flu - like syndrome ( weakness , fatigue , muscle pain , nausea , vomiting , headache , fever , chills , aches , rash , itching , sweats , dizziness , shortness of breath , chest pain , cough , syncope , palpitations ) .
There have been reports of anaphylaxis with the use of rifamycins .
Monitor patients receiving rifabutin therapy for signs and / or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions .
If these symptoms occur , administer supportive measures and discontinue rifabutin .
Uveitis Due to the possible occurrence of uveitis , patients should also be carefully monitored when rifabutin is given in combination with clarithromycin ( or other macrolides ) and / or fluconazole and related compounds ( see Precautions - Drug Interactions , Table 2 ) .
If uveitis is suspected , the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist and , if considered necessary , treatment with rifabutin should be suspended ( see also Adverse Reactions ) .
Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including rifabutin capsules , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibacterial treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions There have been reports of severe cutaneous adverse reactions ( SCAR ) , such as Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) , and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) associated with rifabutin ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely , and rifabutin discontinued if lesions progress .
Specifically , for DRESS , a multi - system potential life - threatening SCAR , time to onset of the first symptoms may be prolonged .
DRESS is a clinical diagnosis , and its clinical presentation remains the basis for decision making .
An early withdrawal of rifabutin is essential because of the syndrome ' s mortality and visceral involvement ( e . g . , liver , bone marrow or kidney ) .
Antiretroviral Drug Interactions Protease inhibitors act as substrates or inhibitors of CYP3A4 mediated metabolism .
Therefore , due to significant drug - drug interactions between protease inhibitors and rifabutin , their concomitant use should be based on the overall assessment of the patient and a patient - specific drug profile .
The concomitant use of protease inhibitors may require at least a 50 % reduction in rifabutin dose , and depending on the protease inhibitor , an adjustment of the antiretroviral drug dose .
Increased monitoring for adverse events is recommended when using these drug combinations ( see Precautions - Drug Interactions ) .
Rifabutin is a CYP3A inducer .
Co - administration with antiretroviral drugs metabolized by CYP3A , including but not limited to products containing bictegravir , rilpivirine , or doravirine may decrease plasma concentrations of those antiretroviral drugs , which may lead to loss of virologic response and possible development of resistance .
Therefore , co - administration with antiretroviral drugs metabolized by CYP3A is not recommended or there may be a need to increase the dose of antiretroviral drugs ( see Precautions - Drug Interactions ) .
For further recommendations , please refer to the most recent prescribing information of the antiretrovirals or contact the specific manufacturer .
PRECAUTIONS General Because treatment with rifabutin capsules may be associated with neutropenia , and more rarely thrombocytopenia , physicians should consider obtaining hematologic studies periodically in patients receiving prophylaxis with rifabutin .
Information for Patients Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of both MAC and tuberculosis , and should be instructed to consult their physicians if they develop new complaints consistent with either of these diseases .
In addition , since rifabutin may rarely be associated with myositis and uveitis , patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they develop signs or symptoms suggesting either of these disorders .
Urine , feces , saliva , sputum , perspiration , tears , and skin may be colored brown - orange with rifabutin and some of its metabolites .
Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained .
Patients to be treated with rifabutin should be made aware of these possibilities .
Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued .
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials , patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial .
If this occurs , patients should contact their physician as soon as possible .
Drug Interactions Effect of Rifabutin on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs Rifabutin induces CYP3A enzymes and therefore may reduce the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by those enzymes .
This effect may reduce the efficacy of standard doses of such drugs , which include itraconazole , clarithromycin , and saquinavir .
Effect of Other Drugs on Rifabutin Pharmacokinetics Some drugs that inhibit CYP3A may significantly increase the plasma concentration of rifabutin .
Therefore , carefully monitor for rifabutin associated adverse events in those patients also receiving CYP3A inhibitors , which include fluconazole and clarithromycin .
In some cases , the dosage of rifabutin may need to be reduced when it is coadministered with CYP3A inhibitors .
Table 2 summarizes the results and magnitude of the pertinent drug interactions assessed with rifabutin .
The clinical relevance of these interactions and subsequent dose modifications should be judged in light of the population studied , severity of the disease , patient ' s drug profile , and the likely impact on the risk / benefit ratio .

Although a weaker enzyme inducer than rifampin , rifabutin may be expected to have some effect on those drugs as well .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term carcinogenicity studies were conducted with rifabutin in mice and in rats .
Rifabutin was not carcinogenic in mice at doses up to 180 mg / kg / day , or approximately 36 times the recommended human daily dose .
Rifabutin was not carcinogenic in the rat at doses up to 60 mg / kg / day , about 12 times the recommended human dose .
Rifabutin was not mutagenic in the bacterial mutation assay ( Ames Test ) using both rifabutin - susceptible and resistant strains .
Rifabutin was not mutagenic in Schizosaccharomyces pombe P1and was not genotoxic in V - 79 Chinese hamster cells , human lymphocytes in vitro , or mouse bone marrow cells in vivo .
Fertility was impaired in male rats given 160 mg / kg ( 32 times the recommended human daily dose ) .
Pregnancy Rifabutin should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant or breastfeeding women .
Reproduction studies have been carried out in rats and rabbits given rifabutin using dose levels up to 200 mg / kg ( about 6 to 13 times the recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons ) .
No teratogenicity was observed in either species .
In rats , given 200 mg / kg / day , ( about 6 times the recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons ) , there was a decrease in fetal viability .
In rats , at 40 mg / kg / day ( approximately equivalent to the recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons ) , rifabutin caused an increase in fetal skeletal variants .
In rabbits , at 80 mg / kg / day ( about 5 times the recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons ) , rifabutin caused maternotoxicity and increase in fetal skeletal anomalies .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , rifabutin should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether rifabutin is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of rifabutin for prophylaxis of MAC in children have not been established .
Limited safety data are available from treatment use in 22 HIV - positive children with MAC who received rifabutin in combination with at least two other antimycobacterials for periods from 1 to 183 weeks .
Mean doses ( mg / kg ) for these children were : 18 . 5 ( range 15 . 0 to 25 . 0 ) for infants 1 year of age , 8 . 6 ( range 4 . 4 to 18 . 8 ) for children 2 to 10 years of age , and 4 . 0 ( range 2 . 8 to 5 . 4 ) for adolescents 14 to 16 years of age .
There is no evidence that doses greater than 5 mg / kg daily are useful .
Adverse experiences were similar to those observed in the adult population , and included leukopenia , neutropenia and rash .
In addition , corneal deposits have been observed in some patients during routine ophthalmologic surveillance of HIV - positive pediatric patients receiving rifabutin as part of a multiple - drug regimen for MAC prophylaxis .
These are tiny , almost transparent , asymptomatic peripheral and central corneal deposits which do not impair vision .
Doses of rifabutin may be administered mixed with foods such as applesauce .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of rifabutin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy ( see Clinical Pharmacology ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Rifabutin capsules were generally well tolerated in the controlled clinical trials .
Discontinuation of therapy due to an adverse event was required in 16 % of patients receiving rifabutin , compared to 8 % of patients receiving placebo in these trials .
Primary reasons for discontinuation of rifabutin were rash ( 4 % of treated patients ) , gastrointestinal intolerance ( 3 % ) , and neutropenia ( 2 % ) .
The following table enumerates adverse experiences that occurred at a frequency of 1 % or greater , among the patients treated with rifabutin in studies 023 and 027 .
Table 3 : Clinical Adverse Experiences Reported in ≥ 1 % of Patients Treated With Rifabutin Adverse event Rifabutin ( N = 566 ) % Placebo ( N = 580 ) % Body as a whole Abdominal pain 4 3 Asthenia 1 1 Chest pain 1 1 Fever 2 1 Headache 3 5 Pain 1 2 Blood and lymphatic system Leucopenia 10 7 Anemia 1 2 Digestive system Anorexia 2 2 Diarrhea 3 3 Dyspepsia 3 1 Eructation 3 1 Flatulence 2 1 Nausea 6 5 Nausea and vomiting 3 2 Vomiting 1 1 Musculoskeletal system Myalgia 2 1 Nervous system Insomnia 1 1 Skin and appendages Rash 11 8 Special senses Taste perversion 3 1 Urogenital system Discolored urine 30 6 Clinical Adverse Events Reported In < 1 % of Patients Who Received Rifabutin Considering data from the 023 and 027 pivotal trials , and from other clinical studies , rifabutin appears to be a likely cause of the following adverse events which occurred in less than 1 % of treated patients : flu - like syndrome , hepatitis , hemolysis , arthralgia , myositis , chest pressure or pain with dyspnea , skin discoloration , thrombocytopenia , pancytopenia and jaundice .
The following adverse events have occurred in more than one patient receiving rifabutin , but an etiologic role has not been established : seizure , paresthesia , aphasia , confusion , and non - specific T wave changes on electrocardiogram .
When rifabutin was administered at doses from 1050 mg / day to 2400 mg / day , generalized arthralgia and uveitis were reported .
These adverse experiences abated when rifabutin was discontinued .
Mild to severe , reversible uveitis has been reported less frequently when rifabutin is used at 300 mg as monotherapy in MAC prophylaxis versus rifabutin in combination with clarithromycin for MAC treatment ( see also Warnings ) .
Uveitis has been infrequently reported when rifabutin is used at 300 mg / day as monotherapy in MAC prophylaxis of HIV - infected persons , even with the concomitant use of fluconazole and / or macrolide antibacterials .
However , if higher doses of rifabutin are administered in combination with these agents , the incidence of uveitis is higher .
Patients who developed uveitis had mild to severe symptoms that resolved after treatment with corticosteroids and / or mydriatic eye drops ; in some severe cases , however , resolution of symptoms occurred after several weeks .
When uveitis occurs , temporary discontinuance of rifabutin and ophthalmologic evaluation are recommended .
In most mild cases , rifabutin may be restarted ; however , if signs or symptoms recur , use of rifabutin should be discontinued ( Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , September 9 , 1994 ) .
Corneal deposits have been reported during routine ophthalmologic surveillance of some HIV - positive pediatric patients receiving rifabutin as part of a multiple drug regimen for MAC prophylaxis .
The deposits are tiny , almost transparent , asymptomatic peripheral and central corneal deposits , and do not impair vision .
The following table enumerates the changes in laboratory values that were considered as laboratory abnormalities in Studies 023 and 027 .
Table 4 : Percentage of Patients With Laboratory Abnormalities Includes grades 3 or 4 toxicities as specified : 1 All values > 450 U / L 2 All values > 150 U / L 3 All hemoglobin values < 8 . 0 g / dL 4 All WBC values < 1 , 500 / mm 5 All ANC values < 750 / mm 6 All platelet count values < 50 , 000 / mm Laboratory abnormalities Rifabutin ( n = 566 ) % Placebo ( n = 580 ) % Chemistry Increased alkaline phosphatase1 < 1 3 Increased SGOT2 7 12 Increased SGPT2 9 11 Hematology Anemia3 6 7 Eosinophilia 1 1 Leukopenia4 17 16 Neutropenia 5 25 20 Thrombocytopenia6 5 4 The incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with rifabutin was significantly greater than in patients treated with placebo ( p = 0 . 03 ) .
Although thrombocytopenia was not significantly more common among patients treated with rifabutin in these trials , rifabutin has been clearly linked to thrombocytopenia in rare cases .
One patient in Study 023 developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura , which was attributed to rifabutin .
Adverse Reactions from Post - Marketing Experience Adverse reactions identified through post - marketing surveillance by system organ class ( SOC ) are listed below : Blood and lymphatic system disorders White blood cell disorders ( including agranulocytosis , lymphopenia , granulocytopenia , neutropenia , white blood cell count decreased , neutrophil count decreased ) , platelet count decreased .
Immune system disorders Hypersensitivity , bronchospasm , rash , and eosinophilia .
Gastrointestinal disorders Clostridioides difficile colitis / Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea .
Pyrexia , rash and other hypersensitivity reactions such as eosinophilia and bronchospasm might occur , as has been seen with other antibacterials .
A limited occurrence of skin discoloration has been reported .
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions ( SCARs ) : Rifabutin has been associated with the occurrence of DRESS as well as other SCARs such as SJS , TEN , and AGEP ( see WARNINGS ) .
Rifamycin hypersensitivity reactions Hypersensitivity to rifamycins have been reported including flu - like symptoms , bronchospasm , hypotension , urticaria , angioedema , conjunctivitis , thrombocytopenia or neutropenia .

ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY Liver abnormalities ( increased bilirubin and liver weight ) occurred in mice , rats and monkeys at doses ( respectively ) 0 . 5 , 1 , and 3 times the recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons .
Testicular atrophy occurred in baboons at doses 2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area comparisons , and in rats at doses 6 times the recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons .
OVERDOSAGE No information is available on accidental overdosage in humans .
Treatment While there is no experience in the treatment of overdose with rifabutin capsules , clinical experience with rifamycins suggests that gastric lavage to evacuate gastric contents ( within a few hours of overdose ) , followed by instillation of an activated charcoal slurry into the stomach , may help absorb any remaining drug from the gastrointestinal tract .
Rifabutin is 85 % protein bound and distributed extensively into tissues ( Vss : 8 to 9 L / kg ) .
It is not primarily excreted via the urinary route ( less than 10 % as unchanged drug ) ; therefore , neither hemodialysis nor forced diuresis is expected to enhance the systemic elimination of unchanged rifabutin from the body in a patient with an overdose of rifabutin .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION It is recommended that rifabutin capsules USP be administered at a dose of 300 mg once daily .
For those patients with propensity to nausea , vomiting , or other gastrointestinal upset , administration of rifabutin at doses of 150 mg twice daily taken with food may be useful .
For patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min ) , consider reducing the dose of rifabutin by 50 % , if toxicity is suspected .
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment .
Reduction of the dose of rifabutin may also be needed for patients receiving concomitant treatment with certain other drugs ( see Precautions - Drug Interactions ) .
Mild hepatic impairment does not require a dose modification .
The pharmacokinetics of rifabutin in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is not known .
