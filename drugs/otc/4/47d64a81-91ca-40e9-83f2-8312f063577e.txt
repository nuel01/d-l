WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at the lowest doses tested .
( 5 . 1 ) Cushing ' s syndrome , hyperglycemia , and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids .
( 5 . 1 ) Systemic absorption may require periodic evaluation for HPA axis suppression .
Modify use if HPA axis suppression develops .
( 5 . 1 ) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids .
( 5 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) Local adverse reactions with topical corticosteroids may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids , including clobetasol propionate .
These reactions include : folliculitis , acneiform eruptions , hypopigmentation , perioral dermatitis , allergic contact dermatitis , secondary infection , striae and miliaria .
( 5 . 2 ) Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % is flammable , keep away from heat or flame .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Effects on the Endocrine System Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at the lowest doses tested .
Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency .
This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid .
In studies evaluating the potential for hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression , using the Cosyntropin Stimulation Test , Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % demonstrated rates of suppression that were comparable after 2 and 4 weeks of twice - daily use ( 19 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively ) , in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis ( ≥ 20 % BSA ) .
In these studies , HPA axis suppression was defined as serum cortisol level ≤ 18 μg / dL 30 - min post cosyntropin stimulation [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ] .
Because of the potential for systemic absorption , use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression .
Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids , use over large surface areas , use over prolonged periods , use under occlusion , use on an altered skin barrier , and use in patients with liver failure .
An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression .
If HPA axis suppression is documented , an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug , to reduce the frequency of application , or to substitute a less potent steroid .
Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids .
Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids .
Cushing ' s syndrome , hyperglycemia , and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids .
Use of more than one corticosteroid - containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure .
Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] 5 . 2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids .
They may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids , including clobetasol propionate .
These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence : folliculitis , acneiform eruptions , hypopigmentation , perioral dermatitis , allergic contact dermatitis , secondary infection , striae and miliaria .
5 . 3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation .
Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing .
5 . 4 Concomitant Skin Infections In the presence of dermatological infections , the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted .
If a favorable response does not occur promptly , use of Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled .
5 . 5 Flammable Contents Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % is flammable ; keep away from heat or flame .
6 .
ADVERSE REACTIONS In controlled , clinical trials with Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % , the most common adverse reactions ( incidence > 2 % ) were burning , pruritus , nasopharyngitis , upper respiratory tract infection .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Taro at 1 - 866 - 923 - 4914 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In controlled , clinical trials with Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % , the most common adverse reaction was burning at the site of application [ 40 % of subjects treated with Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % and 47 % of subjects treated with Spray Vehicle ] .
Other commonly reported adverse reactions for Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % and Spray Vehicle , respectively , are noted in Table 1 .
Table 1 - Commonly Occurring Adverse Reactions ( ≥ 1 % Incidence ) Adverse Reaction Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % ( N = 120 ) Vehicle Spray ( N = 120 ) System Organ Class General disorders and administration site conditions 50 ( 42 % ) 56 ( 47 % ) Application site burning 48 ( 40 % ) 56 ( 47 % ) Application site dryness 2 ( 2 % ) 0 ( 0 % ) Application site irritation 1 ( 1 % ) 0 ( 0 % ) Application site pain 1 ( 1 % ) 2 ( 2 % ) Application site pigmentation changes 1 ( 1 % ) 0 ( 0 % ) Application site pruritus 4 ( 3 % ) 3 ( 3 % ) Infections and infestations 17 ( 14 % ) 12 ( 10 % ) Nasopharyngitis 6 ( 5 % ) 3 ( 3 % ) Pharyngitis streptococcal 1 ( 1 % ) 0 ( 0 % ) Upper respiratory tract infection 10 ( 8 % ) 2 ( 2 % ) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 4 ( 3 % ) 2 ( 2 % ) Eczema asteatotic 2 ( 2 % ) 0 ( 0 % ) Most local adverse reactions were rated as mild to moderate and they are not affected by age , race or gender .
Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression , manifestations of Cushing ' s syndrome , hyperglycemia , and glycosuria in some patients .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % .
Skin : Burning , pruritus , erythema , pain , irritation , rash , peeling , urticaria , and contact dermatitis .
8 .
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C : There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels .
Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application to laboratory animals .
Clobetasol propionate is absorbed percutaneously , and when administered subcutaneously it was a significant teratogen in both the rabbit and the mouse .
Clobetasol propionate has greater teratogenic potential than steroids that are less potent .
The effect of clobetasol propionate on pregnancy outcome and development of offspring was studied in the rat .
Clobetasol propionate was administered subcutaneously to female rats twice daily ( 0 , 12 . 5 , 25 , and 50 μg / kg / day ) from day 7 of presumed gestation through day 25 of lactation or day 24 presumed gestation for those rats that did not deliver a litter .
The maternal NOEL for clobetasol propionate was less than 12 . 5 μg / kg / day due to reduced body weight gain and feed consumption during the gestation period .
The reproductive NOEL in the dams was 25 μg / kg / day ( ratio of animal dose to proposed human dose of 0 . 07 on a mg / m2 / day basis ) based on prolonged delivery at a higher dose level .
The no - observed - adverse - effect - level ( NOAEL ) for viability and growth in the offspring was 12 . 5 μg / kg / day ( ratio of animal dose to proposed human dose of 0 . 03 on a mg / m2 / day basis ) based on incidence of stillbirths , reductions in pup body weights on days 1 and 7 of lactation , increased pup mortality , increases in the incidence of umbilical hernia , and increases in the incidence of pups with cysts on the kidney at higher dose levels during the preweaning period .
The weights of the epididymides and testes were significantly reduced at higher dosages .
Despite these changes , there were no effects on the mating and fertility of the offspring .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth , interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production , or cause other untoward effects .
It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , because safety has not been established and because numerically high rates of HPA axis suppression were seen with other clobetasol propionate topical formulations .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients treated with Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % have not been established [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Because of higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass , pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushing ' s syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids .
They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during and / or after withdrawal of treatment .
Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children .
HPA axis suppression , Cushing ' s syndrome , linear growth retardation , delayed weight gain , and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids .
Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and absence of response to ACTH stimulation .
Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles , headaches , and bilateral papilledema .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to adequately determine whether they respond differently than younger patients .
In two randomized , vehicle controlled clinical trials , 21 of the 240 patients ( 9 % ) were over the age of 65 .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be made with caution , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
10 .
OVERDOSAGE Topically applied Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % can be absorbed in sufficient amount to produce systemic effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
11 .
DESCRIPTION Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % contains clobetasol propionate , a synthetic fluorinated corticosteroid , for topical use .
The corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti - inflammatory and antipruritic agents .
Clobetasol propionate is 21 - chloro - 9 - fluoro - 11β , 17 - dihydroxy - 16β - methylpregna - 1 , 4 - diene - 3 , 20 - dione 17 - propionate , with the empirical formula C25H32ClFO5 , and a molecular weight of 466 . 97 ( CAS Registry Number 25122 - 46 - 7 ) .
The following is the chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clobetasol propionate is a white to almost white crystalline powder that is practically insoluble in water .
Each gram of Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % contains 0 . 5 mg of clobetasol propionate , in a clear , colorless liquid composed of alcohol , isopropyl myristate , sodium lauryl sulfate , and undecylenic acid .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Like other topical corticosteroids Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % has anti - inflammatory , antipruritic , and vasoconstrictive properties .
The mechanism of the anti - inflammatory activity of the topical steroids in general is unclear .
However , corticosteroids are thought to act by induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins , collectively called lipocortins .
It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor , arachidonic acid .
Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstrictor Assay Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % is in the super - high range of potency as demonstrated in a vasoconstrictor study in healthy subjects when compared with other topical corticosteroids .
However , similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence .
Hypothalamic - Pituitary - Adrenal ( HPA ) Axis Suppression The effect of Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % on hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis function was investigated in adults in two studies .
In the first study , patients with plaque psoriasis covering at least 20 % of their body applied Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % twice daily for up to 4 weeks .
15 % ( 2 out of 13 ) of patients displayed adrenal suppression after 4 weeks of use based on the Cosyntropin Stimulation Test .
The laboratory suppression was transient ; all subjects returned to normal after cessation of drug use .
In the second study , patients with plaque psoriasis covering at least 20 % of their body applied Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % twice daily for either 2 or 4 weeks .
19 % ( 4 out of 21 ) of patients treated for 2 weeks and 20 % ( 3 out of 15 ) of patients treated for 4 weeks displayed adrenal suppression at the end of treatment based on the Cosyntropin Stimulation Test .
The laboratory suppression was transient ; all subjects returned to normal after cessation of drug use .
In these studies , HPA axis suppression was defined as serum cortisol level ≤ 18 μg / dL 30 - min post cosyntropin ( ACTH 1 - 24 ) stimulation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors , including the vehicle , the integrity of the epidermal barrier and occlusion .
Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin .
Inflammation and other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption .
There are no human data regarding the distribution of corticosteroids to body organs following topical application .
Nevertheless , once absorbed through the skin , topical corticosteroids are handled through metabolic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids .
They are metabolized , primarily in the liver , and are then excreted by the kidneys .
In addition , some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile .
13 .
NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Clobetasol propionate was not carcinogenic to rats when topically applied for 2 years at concentrations up to 0 . 005 % which corresponded to doses up to 11 μg / kg / day ( ratio of animal dose to proposed human dose of 0 . 03 on a mg / m2 / day basis ) .
Clobetasol propionate at concentrations up to 0 . 001 % did not increase the rate of formation of ultra violet light - induced skin tumors when topically applied to hairless mice 5 days per week for a period of 40 weeks .
Clobetasol propionate was negative in the in vitro mammalian chromosomal aberration test and in the in vivo mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus test .
The effect of subcutaneously administered clobetasol propionate on fertility and general reproductive toxicity was studied in rats at doses of 0 , 12 . 5 , 25 , and 50 μg / kg / day .
Males were treated beginning 70 days before mating and females beginning 15 days before mating through day 7 of gestation .
A dosage level of less than 12 . 5 μg / kg / day clobetasol propionate was considered to be the no - observed - effect - level ( NOEL ) for paternal and maternal general toxicity based on decreased weight gain and for male reproductive toxicity based on increased weights of the seminal vesicles with fluid .
The female reproductive NOEL was 12 . 5 μg / kg / day ( ratio of animal dose to proposed human dose of 0 . 03 on a mg / m2 / day basis ) based on reduction in the numbers of estrous cycles during the pre - cohabitation period and an increase in the number of nonviable embryos at higher doses .
14 .
CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % in psoriasis has been demonstrated in two randomized , vehicle controlled clinical trials , which were identical in design .
The studies were conducted in patients aged 18 years and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis .
Patients were treated twice daily for up to 4 weeks with either Clobetasol Propionate Topical Spray , 0 . 05 % or vehicle spray .
Patients were evaluated on their Overall Disease Severity , a 5 - point scale based on scaling , erythema , and plaque elevation that classified subjects as clear , almost clear , mild , moderate , or severe / very severe .
Only patients classified as moderate or severe / very severe at baseline were enrolled in the studies .
The median percent body surface area ( BSA ) at baseline was 6 % for the two studies .
The numbers of patients scored as clear or almost clear at Weeks 2 and 4 are presented in Table 2 .
