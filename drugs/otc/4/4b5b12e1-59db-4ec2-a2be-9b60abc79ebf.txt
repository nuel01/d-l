• History of hypersensitivity to nateglinide or its inactive ingredients ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypoglycemia : Nateglinide may cause hypoglycemia .
Administer before meals to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia .
Skip the scheduled dose of nateglinide if a meal is skipped to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia .
( 5 . 1 ) • Macrovascular outcomes : There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with nateglinide .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Hypoglycemia All glinides , including nateglinide can cause hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures , may be life - threatening , or cause death .
Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time ; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important ( e . g . , driving or operating other machinery ) .
Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual .
Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes , in patients with diabetic neuropathy ( nerve disease ) , in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system ( e . g . , beta - blockers ) { see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ) , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia .
Factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern ( e . g . , macronutrient content ) , changes in level of physical activity , changes to coadministered medication { see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] , and concomitant use with other antidiabetic agents .
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients should take nateglinide before meals and be instructed to skip the dose of nateglinide if a meal is skipped [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) 1 .
Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia .
Self - monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia .
In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia , increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended .
5 . 2 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with nateglinide .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reaction is also described elsewhere in the labeling : Hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 .
1 ) ] 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In clinical trials , approximately 2 , 600 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were treated with nateglinide .
Of these , approximately 1 , 335 patients were treated for 6 months or longer and approximately 190 patients for one year or longer .
Table 1 shows the most common adverse reactions associated with nateglinide .

Non - severe hypoglycemia occurred in 2 . 4 % of nateglinide tablets treated patients and 0 . 4 % of placebo treated patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Weight Gain Patients treated with nateglinide tablets had statistically significant mean increases in weight compared to placebo .
In clinical trials , the mean weight increases with nateglinide tablets 60 mg ( 3 times daily ) and nateglinide tablets 120 mg ( 3 times daily ) compared to placebo were 1 . 0 kg and 1 . 6 kg respectively .
Laboratory Test Increases in Uric Acid : There were increases in mean uric acid levels for patients treated with nateglinide tablets alone , nateglinide tablets in combination with metformin , metformin alone , and glyburide alone .
The respective differences from placebo were 0 . 29 mg / dl , 0 . 45 m9 / dl , 0 . 28 m9 / dl , and 0 . 19 mg / dl .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of nateglinide tablets .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Hypersensitivity reactions : Rash , itching , and urticaria • Hepatobiliary Disorders : Jaundice , cholestatic hepatitis , and elevated liver enzymes 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 2 includes a list of drugs with clinically important drug interactions when concomitantly administered or withdrawn with nateglinide tablets and instructions for managing or preventing them .
Table 2 : Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with NateglinideDrugs That May Increase the Blood - Glucose - Lowering Effect of Nateglinide and Susceptibility to Hypoglycemia Drugs : Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , salicylates , monoamine oxidase inhibitors , non - selective beta - adrenergic - blocking agents , anabolic hormones ( e . g . methandrostenolone ) , guanethidine , gymnema sylvestre , glucomannan , thioctic acid , and inhibitors of CYP2C9 ( e . g . amiodarone , fluconazole , voriconazole , sulfinpyrazone ) or in patients known to be poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates , alcohol .
Intervention : Dose increases and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when nateglinide tablets are coadministered with these drugs .
Drugs and Herbals That May Reduce the Blood - Glucose - Lowering Effect of Nateglinide and Increase Susceptibility to Hyperglycemia Drugs : Thiazides , corticosteroids , thyroid products , sympathomimetics , somatropin , somatostatin analogues ( e . g . lanreotide , octreotide ) , and CYP inducers ( e . g . rifampin , phenytoin and St John ' s Wort ) .

Drugs That May Blunt Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia Drugs : beta - blockers , clonidine , guanethidine , and reserpine Intervention : Increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when nateglinide tablets are coadministered with these drugs .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of nateglinide in pregnant women .
It is unknown whether nateglinide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Nateglinide tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
In the rabbit , embryonic development was adversely affected and the incidence of gall bladder agenesis or small gallbladder was increased at a dose of 500 mg / kg ( approximately 27 times the human therapeutic exposure of 120 mg three times daily , based on body surface area ) .
Nateglinide was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 1 , 000 mg / kg ( approximately 27 times the human therapeutic exposure based on body surface area ) .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nateglinide is excreted in human milk .
Nateglinide is excreted in rat milk .
Offspring of rats exposed to 1 , 000 mg / kg nateglinide ( approximately 27 times the human therapeutic exposure of 120 mg three times daily , based on body surface area ) had lower body weight .
Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist , a decision should be made as to whether nateglinide should be discontinued in nursing mothers , or if mothers should discontinue nursing .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of nateglinide have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use 436 patients 65 years and older , and 80 patients 75 years and older were exposed to nateglinide in clinical studies .
No differences were observed in safety or efficacy of nateglinide tablets between patients age 65 and over , and those under age 65 .
However , greater sensitivity of some older individuals to nateglinide tablets therapy cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to severe renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 .
7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment .
Use of nateglinide in patients with moderate - to - severe hepatic impairment has not been studied and therefore , should be used with caution in these patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no instances of overdose with nateglinide in clinical trials .
However , an overdose may result in an exaggerated glucose - lowering effect with the development of hypoglycemic symptoms .
Hypoglycemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurological findings should be treated with oral glucose and adjustments in dosage and / or meal patterns .
Severe hypoglycemic reactions with coma , seizure , or other neurological symptoms should be treated with intravenous glucose .
As nateglinide are highly protein bound , dialysis is not an efficient means of removing it from the blood .
11 DESCRIPTION Nateglinide , USP is an oral blood glucose - lowering drug of the glinide class .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Nateglinide lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin secretion from the pancreas .
This action is dependent upon functioning beta - cells in the pancreatic islets .
Nateglinide interacts with the ATP - sensitive potassium ( K + ATP ) channel on pancreatic beta - cells .
The subsequent depolarization of the beta cell opens the calcium channel , producing calcium influx and insulin secretion .
The extent of insulin release is glucose dependent and diminishes at low glucose levels .
Nateglinide is highly tissue selective with low affinity for heart and skeletal muscle .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Nateglinide tablets stimulates pancreatic insulin secretion within 20 minutes of oral administration .
When nateglinide tablets are dosed before meals , the peak rise in plasma insulin occurs approximately 1 hour after dosing and falls to baseline by 4 hours after dosing .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with Type 2 diabetes , multiple dose administration of nateglinide over the dosage range of 60 mg to 240 mg shows linear pharmacokinetics for both AUC and C MAX .
In patients with Type 2 diabetes , there is no apparent accumulation of nateglinide upon multiple dosing of up to 240 mg three times daily for 7 days .
Absorption Absolute bioavailability of nateglinide is approximately 73 % .
Plasma profiles are characterized by multiple plasma concentration peaks when nateglinide is administered under fasting conditions .
This effect is diminished when nateglinide is taken prior to a meal .
Following oral administration immediately prior to a meal , the mean peak plasma nateglinide concentrations ( C MAX ) generally occur within 1 hour ( TMAX ) after dosing .
TMAX is independent of dose .
The pharmacokinetics of nateglinide are not affected by the composition of a meal ( high protein , fat , or carbohydrate ) .
However , peak plasma levels are significantly reduced when nateglinide tablets are administered 10 minutes prior to a liquid meal as compared to solid meal .
When given with or after meals , the extent of nateglinide absorption ( AUC ) remains unaffected .
However , there is a delay in the rate of absorption characterized by a decrease in CMAX and a delay in time to peak plasma concentration ( TMAX ) .
Nateglinide tablets did not have any effect on gastric emptying in healthy subjects as assessed by acetaminophen testing .
Distribution Following intravenous ( IV ) administration of nateglinide , the steady - state volume of distribution of nateglinide is estimated to be approximately 10 L in healthy subjects .
Nateglinide is extensively bound ( 98 % ) to serum proteins , primarily serum albumin , and to a lesser extent a acid glycoprotein .
The extent of serum protein binding is independent of drug concentration over the test range of 0 . 1 to 10 mcg / ml .
Elimination In healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , nateglinide plasma concentrations declined with an average elimination half - life of approximately 1 . 5 hours .
Metabolism In vitro drug metabolism studies indicate that nateglinide tablets are predominantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2C9 ( 70 % ) and to a lesser extent CYP3A4 ( 30 % ) .
The major routes of metabolism are hydroxylation followed by glucuronide conjugation .
The major metabolites are less potent antidiabetic agents than nateglinide .
The isoprene minor metabolite possesses potency similar to that of the parent compound nateglinide .
Excretion Nateglinide and its metabolites are rapidly and completely eliminated following oral administration .
Eighty - three percent of the 14 c _ nateglinide was excreted in the urine with an additional 10 % eliminated in the feces .
Approximately 16 % of the 14 c _ Nateglinide was excreted in the urine as parent compound .
Specific Populations Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic data are available in subjects with mild renal impairment ( CrCI 60 to 89 mL / min ) .
Compared to healthy matched subjects , patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate and severe renal impairment ( CrCl 15 to 50 mL / min ) not on dialysis displayed similar apparent clearance , AUG , and C MAX .
Patients with type 2 diabetes and renal failure on dialysis exhibited reduced overall drug exposure ( C MAX decreased by 49 % ; not statistically significant ) .
However , hemodialysis patients also experienced reductions in plasma protein binding compared to the matched healthy volunteers .
In a cohort of 8 patients with type 2 diabetes and end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) ( eGFR < 15 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) M1 metabolite accumulation up to 1 . 2 ng / mL occurred with a dosage of 90 mg once daily for 1 to 3 months .
In another cohort of 8 patients with type 2 diabetes on hemodialysis , M 1 concentration decreased after a single session of hemodialysis .
Although the hypoglycemic activity of the M1 metabolite is approximately 5 times lower than nateglinide , metabolite accumulation may increase the hypoglycemic effect of the administered dose .
Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild hepatic impairment , the mean increase in C MAX and AUC of nateglinide were 37 % and 30 % respectively , as compared to healthy matched control subjects .
There is no data on pharmacokinetics of nateglinide tablets in patients with moderate - to - severe hepatic impairment .
Gender No clinically significant differences in nateglinide pharmacokinetics were observed between men and women .
Race Results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis including subjects of Caucasian , Black , and other ethnic origins suggest that race has little influence on the pharmacokinetics of nateglinide .
Age Age does not influence the pharmacokinetic properties of nateglinide .
Drug Interactions : In vitro assessment of drug interactions Nateglinide is a potential inhibitor of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme in viva as indicated by its ability to inhibit the in vitro metabolism of tolbutamide .
Inhibition of CYP3A4 metabolic reactions was not detected in in vitro experiments .
In vitro displacement studies with highly protein - bound drugs such as furosemide , propranolol , captopril , nicardipine , pravastatin , glyburide , warfarin , phenytoin , acetylsalicylic acid , tolbutamide , and metformin showed no influence on the extent of nateglinide protein binding .
Similarly , nateglinide had no influence on the serum protein binding of propranolol , glyburide , nicardipine , warfarin , phenytoin , acetylsalicylic acid , and tolbutamide in vitro .
However , prudent evaluation of individual cases is warranted in the clinical setting .
In vivo assessment of drug interactions The effect of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of nateglinide and the effect of nateglinide on pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs are shown in Tables 3 and 4 .
No clinically relevant change in pharmacokinetic parameters of either agent was reported when nateglinide was coadministered with glyburide , metformin , digoxin , warfarin , and diclofenac .

Oral doses of nateglinide up to 900 mg / kg in rats and 400 mg / kg in mice were tested , which produced exposures in rats approximately 30 to 40 times and in mice 10 to 30 times the human therapeutic exposure of nateglinide at a dose of 120 mg three times daily , based on AUC .
Mutagenesis : Nateglinide was not genotoxic in the in vM : ra Ames test , mouse lymphoma assay , chromosome aberration assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
Impairment of Fertility : Fertility was unaffected by administration of nateglinide to rats at doses up to 600 mg / kg ( approximately 16 times the human therapeutic exposure with a recommended nateglinide tablets dose of 120 mg three times daily before meals ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Monotherapy In a 24 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive either nateglinide tablets ( 60 mg or 120 mg three times daily before meals ) or placebo .
Patients previously treated with antidiabetic medications were required to discontinue that medication for at least 2 months before randomization .
At Week 24 , treatment with nateglinide tablets before meals resulted in statistically significant reductions in mean HbA1C and mean fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) compared to placebo ( see Table 5 ) .
The reductions in HbA1C and FPG were similar for patient ' s naive to , and those previously exposed to , antidiabetic medications .

Fifty - seven percent of patients were previously untreated with oral antidiabetic therapy .
Patients previously treated with antidiabetic medications were required to discontinue medication for at least 2 months before randomization .
At Week 24 , statistically significant reductions in mean HbA1c and FPG were observed with metformin monotherapy compared to nateglinide tablets monotherapy , and the combination of nateglinide tablets and metformin compared to either nateglinide tablets or metformin monotherapy ( see Table 7 ) .
Compared to placebo , nateglinide monotherapy was associated with a statistically significant increase in mean body weight , while no significant change in body weight was observed with metformin monotherapy or combination of nateglinide and metformin therapy ( see Table 7 ) .
Among the subset of patients previously treated with other antidiabetic agents , primarily glyburide , HbA1C in the nateglinide monotherapy group increased slightly from baseline , whereas HbA1C was reduced in the metformin monotherapy group ( see Table 7 ) .
