None ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypotension : Monitor blood pressure .
( 5 . 1 ) • Patients with Cirrhosis : Higher risk of adverse reactions .
Monitor blood pressure and pulse .
( 5 . 2 ) • CYP3A4 Strong Inhibitors : May significantly increase risk of hypotension .
Concomitant use with NYMALIZE should generally be avoided .
( 5 . 3 ) • CYP3A4 Strong Inducers : May significantly reduce efficacy of nimodipine .
Concomitant use with NYMALIZE should generally be avoided .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Hypotension Blood pressure should be carefully monitored during treatment with NYMALIZE .
In clinical studies of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage , about 5 % of nimodipine - treated patients compared to 1 % of placebo - treated patients had hypotension and about 1 % of nimodipine - treated patients left the study because of this [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
5 . 2 Possible Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cirrhosis Given that the plasma levels of nimodipine are increased in patients with cirrhosis , these patients are at higher risk of adverse reactions .
Therefore , monitor blood pressure and pulse rate closely and administer a lower dosage [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Possible Increased Risk of Hypotension with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as some macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , clarithromycin , telithromycin ) , some HIV protease inhibitors ( e . g . , indinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir ) , some HCV protease inhibitors ( e . g . , boceprevir , telaprevir ) , some azole antimycotics ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , posaconazole , voriconazole ) , conivaptan , delavirdine , and nefazodone with nimodipine should generally be avoided because of a risk of significant hypotension [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 4 Possible Reduced Efficacy with Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers ( e . g . , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin , rifampin , St . John ' s wort ) and nimodipine should generally be avoided , as nimodipine plasma concentration and efficacy may be significantly reduced [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety and efficacy of NYMALIZE ( nimodipine oral solution ) in the treatment of patients with SAH is based on adequate and well - controlled studies of nimodipine oral capsules in patients with SAH .
NYMALIZE ( nimodipine oral solution ) has comparable bioavailability to nimodipine oral capsules .
The following clinically significant adverse reaction appears in other sections of the labeling : • Hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 1 % and ≥ 1 % placebo ) were hypotension , headache , nausea , and bradycardia .

Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
In clinical trials of nimodipine oral capsules in patients with SAH , eleven percent ( 92 of 823 ) of nimodipine - treated patients reported adverse events compared to six percent ( 29 of 479 ) of placebo - treated patients .
The most common adverse event was decreased blood pressure in 4 . 4 % of nimodipine - treated patients .
The events reported with a frequency greater than 1 % are displayed in Table 1 by dose .
Table 1 : Adverse Events [ n ( % ) ] reported with a frequency > 1 % in four clinical trials ( Study 1 , Study 2 , Study 3 , and Study 4 ) Placebo ( n = 479 ) Nimodipine dose every 4 hours 0 . 35 mg / kg ( n = 82 ) 30 mg ( n = 71 ) 60 mg ( n = 494 ) 90 mg ( n = 172 ) 120 mg ( n = 4 ) Decreased Blood Pressure 6 ( 1 . 2 ) 1 ( 1 . 2 ) 0 19 ( 3 . 8 ) 14 ( 8 . 1 ) 2 ( 50 . 0 ) Edema 3 ( 0 . 6 ) 0 0 2 ( 0 . 4 ) 2 ( 1 . 2 ) 0 Diarrhea 3 ( 0 . 6 ) 0 3 ( 4 . 2 ) 0 3 ( 1 . 7 ) 0 Rash 3 ( 0 . 6 ) 2 ( 2 . 4 ) 0 3 ( 0 . 6 ) 2 ( 1 . 2 ) 0 Headache 1 ( 0 . 2 ) 0 1 ( 1 . 4 ) 6 ( 1 . 2 ) 0 0 Gastrointestinal Symptoms 0 2 ( 2 . 4 ) 0 0 2 ( 1 . 2 ) 0 Nausea 0 1 ( 1 . 2 ) 1 ( 1 . 4 ) 6 ( 1 . 2 ) 1 ( 0 . 6 ) 0 Dyspnea 0 1 ( 1 . 2 ) 0 0 0 0 EKG Abnormalities 0 0 1 ( 1 . 4 ) 0 1 ( 0 . 6 ) 0 Tachycardia 0 0 1 ( 1 . 4 ) 0 0 0 Bradycardia 0 0 0 5 ( 1 . 0 ) 1 ( 0 . 6 ) 0 Muscle Pain / Cramp 0 0 1 ( 1 . 4 ) 1 ( 0 . 2 ) 1 ( 0 . 6 ) 0 Acne 0 0 1 ( 1 . 4 ) 0 0 0 Depression 0 0 1 ( 1 . 4 ) 0 0 0 SAH is frequently accompanied by alterations in consciousness that may lead to an under - reporting of adverse experiences .
As a calcium channel blocker , nimodipine may have the potential to exacerbate heart failure in susceptible patients or to interfere with A - V conduction , but these events were not observed in SAH trials .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Anti - Hypertensives : May increase risk of hypotension .
Monitor blood pressure .
( 7 . 1 ) • CYP3A4 Moderate and Weak Inhibitors : May increase risk of hypotension .
Monitor blood pressure .
Dose reduction of NYMALIZE may be needed .
Avoid grapefruit juice .
( 7 . 2 ) • CYP3A4 Moderate and Weak Inducers : May reduce efficacy of NYMALIZE .
Dose increase may be needed .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Blood Pressure Lowering Drugs Nimodipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of concomitantly administered anti - hypertensives such as diuretics , beta - blockers , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers , other calcium channel blockers , α - adrenergic blockers , PDE5 inhibitors , and α - methyldopa .
In Europe , nimodipine was observed to occasionally intensify the effect of antihypertensive drugs taken concomitantly by hypertensive patients ; this phenomenon was not observed in North American clinical trials .
Blood pressure should be carefully monitored , and dose adjustment of the blood pressure lowering drug ( s ) may be necessary .
7 . 2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Nimodipine plasma concentration can be significantly increased when concomitantly administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors .
As a consequence , the blood pressure lowering effect may be increased .
Therefore , the concomitant administration of NYMALIZE and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should generally be avoided [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include some members of the following classes : • - macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , clarithromycin , telithromycin ) , • - HIV protease inhibitors ( e . g . , indinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir ) , • - HCV protease inhibitors ( e . g . , boceprevir , telaprevir ) , • - azole antimycotics ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , posaconazole , voriconazole ) , • - conivaptan , delavirdine , nefazodone Nimodipine plasma concentration can also be increased in the presence of moderate and weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 .
If nimodipine is concomitantly administered with these drugs , blood pressure should be monitored , and a reduction of the nimodipine dose may be necessary .
Moderate and weak CYP3A4 inhibitors include alprozalam , ameprenavir , amiodarone , aprepitant , atazanavir , cimetidine , cyclosporine , diltiazem , erythromycin , fluconazole , fluoxetine , isoniazid , oral contraceptives , quinuprestin / dalforpristin , valproic acid , and verapamil .
A study in eight healthy volunteers has shown a 50 % increase in mean peak nimodipine plasma concentrations and a 90 % increase in mean area under the curve , after a one - week course of cimetidine at 1 , 000 mg / day and nimodipine at 90 mg / day .
This effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P - 450 ( CYP ) by cimetidine , which could decrease first - pass metabolism of nimodipine .
Grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4 .
Ingestion of grapefruit / grapefruit juice is not recommended while taking nimodipine .
7 . 3 CYP3A4 Inducers Nimodipine plasma concentration and efficacy may be significantly reduced when concomitantly administered with strong CYP3A4 inducers .
Therefore , concomitant use of NYMALIZE with strong CYP3A4 inducers ( e . g . , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin , rifampin , St . John ' s wort ) should generally be avoided [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Moderate and weak inducers of CYP3A4 may also reduce the efficacy of nimodipine .
Patients on these should be closely monitored for lack of effectiveness , and a nimodipine dosage increase may be required .
Moderate and weak CYP3A4 inducers include , for example : amprenavir , aprepitant , armodafinil , bosentan , efavirnenz , etravirine , Echinacea , modafinil , nafcillin , pioglitazone , prednisone , rufinamide , and vemurafenib .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data may cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of NYMALIZE in pregnant women .
In animal studies , oral administration of nimodipine during pregnancy resulted in adverse effects on development ( increased embryofetal mortality , increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities , decreased fetal growth ) at doses equivalent to ( rat ) or less than ( rabbit ) those used clinically [ see Data ] .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % respectively .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
Data Animal Data Nimodipine has been shown to have a teratogenic effect in two studies in rabbit .
In one study , incidences of malformations and stunted fetuses were increased at oral doses of 1 mg / kg / day and 10 mg / kg / day administered throughout organogenesis but not at 3 mg / kg / day .
In the second study , an increased incidence of stunted fetuses was seen at 1 mg / kg / day but not at higher doses ( 3 mg / kg / day and 10 mg / kg / day ) .
The lowest effect dose in rabbits ( 1 mg / kg / day ) is less than the recommended human dose ( RHD ) of 360 mg / day on a body surface area ( mg / m2 ) basis .
Nimodipine was embryotoxic , causing resorption and stunted growth of fetuses in rats at 100 mg / kg / day administered orally throughout organogenesis ; this dose is approximately 3 times the RHD on a mg / m2 basis .
In two other studies in rats , nimodipine administered orally at 30 mg / kg / day throughout organogenesis and continued until sacrifice ( day 20 of pregnancy or day 21 postpartum ) was associated with higher incidences of skeletal variation , stunted fetuses , and stillbirths but no malformations ; this dose is similar to the RHD on a mg / m2 basis .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Nimodipine has been detected in human milk .
There are no data on the effects of nimodipine on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for NYMALIZE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from NYMALIZE or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data Animal Data [ 14 C ] Nimodipine and its radiolabeled metabolites were secreted in milk of orally dosed lactating rats .
The milk concentration of nimodipine and / or metabolites was higher than that in plasma , with a milk / plasma ratio of 0 . 65 to 4 . 7 .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nimodipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they had a different clinical response than younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dosing in elderly patients should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of overdosage from the oral administration of nimodipine .
Symptoms of overdosage would be expected to be related to cardiovascular effects such as excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked systemic hypotension .
Clinically significant hypotension due to nimodipine overdosage may require active cardiovascular support with pressor agents and specific treatments for calcium channel blocker overdose .
Since nimodipine is highly protein - bound , dialysis is not likely to be of benefit .
11 DESCRIPTION NYMALIZE contains nimodipine , a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker .
Nimodipine is isopropyl 2 - methoxyethyl 1 , 4 - dihydro - 2 , 6 - dimethyl - 4 - ( m - nitrophenyl ) - 3 , 5 - pyridinedicarboxylate .
It has a molecular weight of 418 . 5 and a molecular formula of C21H26N2O7 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Nimodipine is a yellow crystalline substance , practically insoluble in water .
NYMALIZE Oral Solution contains 60 mg of nimodipine per 20 mL .
In addition , the oral solution contains the following inactive ingredients : ethanol , glycerin , methylparaben , polyethylene glycol 400 , sodium phosphate monobasic , sodium phosphate dibasic , and water .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Nimodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker .
The contractile processes of smooth muscle cells are dependent upon calcium ions , which enter these cells during depolarization as slow ionic transmembrane currents .
Nimodipine inhibits calcium ion transfer into these cells and thus inhibits contractions of vascular smooth muscle .
In animal experiments , nimodipine had a greater effect on cerebral arteries than on arteries elsewhere in the body perhaps because it is highly lipophilic , allowing it to cross the blood - brain barrier ; concentrations of nimodipine as high as 12 . 5 ng / mL have been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of nimodipine - treated SAH patients .
The precise mechanism of action of nimodipine in reducing the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits in adult patients with SAH from ruptured intracranial berry aneurysms is unknown .
Although the clinical studies demonstrate a favorable effect of nimodipine on the severity of neurological deficits caused by cerebral vasospasm following SAH , there is no arteriographic evidence that nimodipine either prevents or relieves the spasm of these arteries .
However , whether or not the arteriographic methodology utilized was adequate to detect a clinically meaningful effect , if any , on vasospasm is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In humans , nimodipine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration , and peak concentrations are generally attained within one hour .
The terminal elimination half - life is approximately 8 to 9 hours but earlier elimination rates are much more rapid , equivalent to a half - life of 1 - 2 hours ; a consequence is the need for frequent ( every 4 hours ) dosing .
There were no signs of accumulation when nimodipine was given three times a day for seven days .
Nimodipine is over 95 % bound to plasma proteins .
The binding was concentration independent over the range of 10 ng / mL to 10 mcg / mL .
Nimodipine is eliminated almost exclusively in the form of metabolites and less than 1 % is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug .
Numerous metabolites , all of which are either inactive or considerably less active than the parent compound , have been identified .
The metabolism of nimodipine is mediated by CYP3A4 .
Because of a high first - pass metabolism , the bioavailability of nimodipine averages 13 % after oral administration .
Food Effects In a study of 24 healthy male volunteers , administration of nimodipine capsules following a standard breakfast resulted in a 68 % lower peak plasma concentration and 38 % lower bioavailability relative to dosing under fasted conditions [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with Cirrhosis The bioavailability of nimodipine is significantly increased in patients with cirrhosis , with Cmax approximately double that in normals which necessitates lowering the dose in this group of patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Geriatric Patients In a single parallel - group study involving 24 elderly subjects ( aged 59 - 79 ) and 24 younger subjects ( aged 22 - 40 ) , the observed AUC and Cmax of nimodipine was approximately 2 - fold higher in the elderly population compared to the younger study subjects following oral administration ( given as a single dose of 30 mg and dosed to steady - state with 30 mg three times daily for 6 days ) .
The clinical response to these age - related pharmacokinetic differences , however , was not considered significant .
[ see Use in Specific Populations , Geriatric Use ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a two - year study in rat , the incidences of adenocarcinoma of the uterus and Leydig cell adenoma of the testes were increased at 1800 ppm nimodipine in the diet ( approximately 90 - 120 mg / kg / day ) .
The increases were not statistically significant , however , and the higher rates were within the historical control range for these tumors .
Nimodipine was found not to be carcinogenic in a 91 - week mouse study , but the high dose of 1800 ppm nimodipine in the diet ( approximately 550 - 775 mg / kg / day ) was associated with an increased mortality rate .
Mutagenesis Mutagenicity studies , including the Ames , micronucleus , and dominant lethal assays , were negative .
Impairment of Fertility Nimodipine did not impair the fertility and general reproductive performance of male and female rats following oral doses of up to 30 mg / kg / day when administered prior to mating and continuing in females to day 7 of pregnancy .
This dose in a rat is similar to a clinical dose of 60 mg every 4 hours in a 60 kg patient , on a body surface area ( mg / m2 ) basis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of NYMALIZE ( nimodipine oral solution ) in the treatment of patients with SAH is based on adequate and well - controlled studies of nimodipine oral capsules in patients with SAH .
NYMALIZE ( nimodipine oral solution ) has comparable bioavailability to nimodipine oral capsules .
Nimodipine has been shown in 4 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials to reduce the severity of neurological deficits resulting from vasospasm in patients who have had a recent SAH ( Studies 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) .
The trials used doses ranging from 20 - 30 mg to 90 mg every 4 hours , with drug given for 21 days in 3 studies , and for at least 18 days in the other .
Three of the four trials followed patients for 3 - 6 months .
Three of the trials studied relatively well patients , with all or most patients in Hunt and Hess Grades I - III ( essentially free of focal deficits after the initial bleed ) .
Study 4 studied much sicker patients with Hunt and Hess Grades III - V . Studies 1 and 2 were similar in design , with relatively unimpaired SAH patients randomized to nimodipine or placebo .
In each , a judgment was made as to whether any late - developing deficit was due to spasm or other causes , and the deficits were graded .
Both studies showed significantly fewer severe deficits due to spasm in the nimodipine group ; Study 2 showed fewer spasm - related deficits of all severities .
No effect was seen on deficits not related to spasm .
See Table 2 .
Table 2 : Deficits in Patients with Hunt and Hess Grades I to III in Study 1 and Study 2 Study Grade [ 1 ] Treatment Patients Number Analyzed Number of Patients with Any Deficit Due to Spasm Numbers with Severe Deficit Study 1 I - III Nimodipine 20 - 30 mg every 4 hours 56 13 1 Placebo 60 16 8 [ 2 ] Study 2 I - III Nimodipine 60 mg every 4 hours 31 4 2 Placebo 39 11 10 null [ 1 ] Hunt and Hess Grade [ 2 ] p = 0 . 03 Study 3 was a 554 - patient trial that included SAH patients with all grades of severity ( 89 % were in Hunt and Hess Grades I - III ) .
In Study 3 , patients were treated with placebo or 60 mg of nimodipine every 4 hours .
Outcomes were not defined as spasm related or not but there was a significant reduction in the overall rate of brain infarction and severely disabling neurological outcome at 3 months ( Table 3 ) : Table 3 : Degree of Recovery or Disability in Study 3 ( 89 % Hunt and Hess Grades I - III ) Nimodipine Placebo Total patients 278 276 Good recovery 199 [ 1 ] 169 Moderate disability 24 16 Severe disability 12 [ 2 ] 31 Death 43 [ 3 ] 60 [ 1 ] p = 0 . 0444 – good and moderate vs severe and dead [ 2 ] p = 0 . 001 – severe disability [ 3 ] p = 0 . 056 – death Study 4 enrolled much sicker patients , ( Hunt and Hess Grades III - V ) , who had a high rate of death and disability , and used a dose of 90 mg every 4 hours , but was otherwise similar to Study 1 and Study 2 .
Analysis of delayed ischemic deficits , many of which result from spasm , showed a significant reduction in spasm - related deficits .
Among analyzed patients ( 72 nimodipine , 82 placebo ) , there were the following outcomes ( Table 4 ) .
Table 4 : Neurological Ischemic Deficits in Study 4 [ Hunt and Hess Grades III - V ] Delayed Ischemic Deficits ( DID ) Permanent Deficits Nimodipine 90 mg every 4 hours Placebo Nimodipine 90 mg every 4 hours Placebo n ( % ) n ( % ) n ( % ) n ( % ) DID Spasm Alone 8 ( 11 ) [ 1 ] 25 ( 31 ) 5 ( 7 ) null 22 ( 27 ) DID Spasm Contributing 18 ( 25 ) 21 ( 26 ) 16 ( 22 ) 17 ( 21 ) DID Without Spasm 7 ( 10 ) 8 ( 10 ) 6 ( 8 ) 7 ( 9 ) No DID 39 ( 54 ) 28 ( 34 ) 45 ( 63 ) 36 ( 44 ) [ 1 ] p = 0 . 001 , Nimodipine vs placebo When data were combined for Study 3 and Study 4 , the treatment difference on success rate ( i . e . , good recovery ) on the Glasgow Outcome Scale was 25 . 3 % ( nimodipine ) versus 10 . 9 % ( placebo ) for Hunt and Hess Grades IV or V . Table 5 demonstrates that nimodipine tends to improve good recovery of SAH patients with poor neurological status post - ictus , while decreasing the numbers with severe disability and vegetative survival .
