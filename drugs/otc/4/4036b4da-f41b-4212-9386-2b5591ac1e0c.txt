5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Thrombosis / Thromboembolism : Increased risk in patients with beta thalassemia .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events and institute treatment promptly ( 5 . 1 ) .
• • Hypertension : Monitor blood pressure ( BP ) during treatment .
Initiate anti - hypertensive treatment if necessary ( 5 . 2 ) .
• • Extramedullary Hematopoietic ( EMH ) Masses : Increased risk in patients with beta thalassemia .
Monitor patients for symptoms and signs or complications resulting from the EMH masses .
Treat according to clinical guidelines and discontinue treatment in case of serious complications due to EMH masses ( 5 . 3 ) .
• • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : May cause fetal harm .
Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception ( 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) .
5 . 1 Thrombosis / Thromboembolism In adult patients with beta thalassemia , thromboembolic events ( TEE ) were reported in 8 / 223 ( 3 . 6 % ) REBLOZYL - treated patients .
Reported TEEs included deep vein thromboses , pulmonary embolus , portal vein thrombosis , and ischemic strokes .
Patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism , e . g . splenectomy or concomitant use of hormone replacement therapy , may be at further increased risk of thromboembolic conditions .
Consider thromboprophylaxis in patients with beta thalassemia at increased risk of TEE .
Monitor patients receiving REBLOZYL for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events and institute treatment promptly .
5 . 2 Hypertension Hypertension was reported in 10 . 7 % ( 61 / 571 ) of REBLOZYL - treated patients .
Across clinical studies , the incidence of grade 3 - 4 hypertension ranged from 1 . 8 % to 8 . 6 % .
In adult patients with beta thalassemia with normal baseline blood pressure , 13 ( 6 . 2 % ) patients developed systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥ 130 mm Hg and 33 ( 16 . 6 % ) patients developed diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≥ 80 mm Hg .
In adult patients with MDS with normal baseline blood pressure , 26 ( 29 . 9 % ) patients developed SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg and 23 ( 16 . 4 % ) patients developed DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg .
Monitor blood pressure prior to each administration .
Manage new - onset hypertension or exacerbations of preexisting hypertension using anti - hypertensive agents .
5 . 3 Extramedullary Hematopoietic Masses In adult patients with transfusion dependent beta thalassemia , EMH masses were observed in 3 . 2 % of REBLOZYL - treated patients , with spinal cord compression symptoms due to EMH masses occurring in 1 . 9 % of patients ( BELIEVE and REBLOZYL long - term follow - up study ) .
In a study of adult patients with non - transfusion dependent beta thalassemia , a higher incidence of EMH masses was observed in 6 . 3 % of REBLOZYL - treated patients vs . 2 % of placebo - treated patients in the double - blind phase of the study , with spinal cord compression due to EMH masses occurring in 1 patient with a prior history of EMH .
REBLOZYL is not indicated for use in patients with non - transfusion dependent beta - thalassemia .
Possible risk factors for the development of EMH masses in patients with beta thalassemia include history of EMH masses , splenectomy , splenomegaly , hepatomegaly , or low baseline hemoglobin ( < 8 . 5 g / dL ) .
Signs and symptoms may vary depending on the anatomical location .
Monitor patients with beta thalassemia at initiation and during treatment for symptoms and signs or complications resulting from the EMH masses and treat according to clinical guidelines .
Discontinue treatment with REBLOZYL in case of serious complications due to EMH masses .
Avoid use of REBLOZYL in patients requiring treatment to control the growth of EMH masses .
5 . 4 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproductive studies , REBLOZYL may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of luspatercept - aamt to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in adverse developmental outcomes including increased embryo - fetal mortality , alterations to growth , and structural abnormalities at exposures ( based on area under the curve [ AUC ] ) above those occurring at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 1 . 75 mg / kg .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with REBLOZYL and for at least 3 months after the final dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to luspatercept in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
Of 284 patients with beta thalassemia who were treated with REBLOZYL and evaluable for the presence of anti - luspatercept - aamt antibodies , 4 patients ( 1 . 4 % ) tested positive for treatment - emergent anti - luspatercept - aamt antibodies , including 2 patients ( 0 . 7 % ) who had neutralizing antibodies .
Of 260 patients with MDS who were treated with REBLOZYL and evaluable for the presence of anti - luspatercept - aamt antibodies , 23 patients ( 8 . 9 % ) tested positive for treatment - emergent anti - luspatercept - aamt antibodies , including 9 patients ( 3 . 5 % ) who had neutralizing antibodies .
Luspatercept - aamt serum concentration tended to decrease in the presence of neutralizing antibodies .
There were no severe acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions reported for patients with anti - luspatercept - aamt antibodies in REBLOZYL clinical trials , and there was no association between hypersensitivity type reaction or injection site reaction and presence of anti - luspatercept - aamt antibodies .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed ( 8 . 2 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal reproduction studies , REBLOZYL may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available data on REBLOZYL use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of luspatercept - aamt to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in adverse developmental outcomes including embryo - fetal mortality , alterations to growth , and structural abnormalities at exposures ( based on area under the curve [ AUC ] ) above those occurring at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In embryo - fetal development studies , luspatercept - aamt was administered subcutaneously at 5 , 15 , or 30 mg / kg on gestation days 3 and 10 ( rats ) or 5 , 20 , or 40 mg / kg on gestation days 4 and 11 ( rabbits ) .
Effects in both species included reductions in numbers of live fetuses and fetal body weights , and increases in resorptions , post - implantation losses , and skeletal variations ( such as asymmetric sternal centra in rats and angulated hyoid in rabbits ) .
Effects were observed at exposures ( based on AUC ) approximately 7 - times ( rats ) and 16 - times ( rabbits ) the MRHD of 1 . 75 mg / kg .
In a pre - and postnatal development study , pregnant rats were administered luspatercept - aamt subcutaneously at 3 , 10 , or 30 mg / kg once every 2 weeks during organogenesis and through weaning , gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 .
At all dose levels lower F1 pup body weights and adverse kidney findings ( such as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis , tubular atrophy / hypoplasia , and vessel ectasia occasionally associated with hemorrhage ) were observed .
These effects were observed at exposures ( based on AUC ) approximately 1 . 6 - times the MRHD of 1 . 75 mg / kg .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Luspatercept - aamt was detected in milk of lactating rats .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
There are no data on the presence of REBLOZYL in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with REBLOZYL , and for 3 months after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential before starting REBLOZYL treatment .
Contraception Females REBLOZYL may cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with REBLOZYL and for at least 3 months after the last dose .
Infertility Females Based on findings in animals , REBLOZYL may impair female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Adverse effects on fertility in female rats were reversible after a 14 - week recovery period .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Based on findings in juvenile animals , REBLOZYL is not recommended for use in pediatric patients [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of REBLOZYL in beta thalassemia did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Clinical studies of REBLOZYL for treatment of anemia in MDS - RS and MDS / MPN - RS - T included 206 ( 79 % ) patients ≥ 65 years of age and 93 ( 36 % ) patients ≥ 75 years of age .
No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between older ( ≥ 65 years ) and younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION Luspatercept - aamt is an erythroid maturation agent .
Luspatercept - aamt is a receptor fusion protein consisting of a modified extracellular domain of the human activin receptor type IIB linked to a human IgG1 Fc domain with a calculated molecular mass of approximately 76 kD .
Luspatercept is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology .
REBLOZYL ( luspatercept - aamt ) for injection is a sterile , preservative - free , white to off - white , lyophilized powder in single - dose vials for subcutaneous use after reconstitution .
Each 25 mg single - dose vial provides nominal 25 mg of luspatercept - aamt and citric acid monohydrate ( 0 . 085 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 10 mg ) , sucrose ( 45 . 0 mg ) , and tri - sodium citrate dihydrate ( 1 . 35 mg ) at pH 6 . 5 .
After reconstitution with 0 . 68 mL Sterile Water for Injection USP , the resulting concentration is 25 mg / 0 . 5 mL of luspatercept - aamt and the nominal deliverable volume is 0 . 5 mL .
Each 75 mg single - dose vial provides nominal 75 mg of luspatercept - aamt and citric acid monohydrate ( 0 . 254 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 30 mg ) , sucrose ( 135 mg ) , and tri - sodium citrate dihydrate ( 4 . 06 mg ) at pH 6 . 5 .
After reconstitution with 1 . 6 mL Sterile Water for Injection USP , the resulting concentration is 75 mg / 1 . 5 mL ( 50 mg / mL ) of luspatercept - aamt and the nominal deliverable volume is 1 . 5 mL .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Luspatercept - aamt is a recombinant fusion protein that binds several endogenous TGF - β superfamily ligands , thereby diminishing Smad2 / 3 signaling .
Luspatercept - aamt promoted erythroid maturation through differentiation of late - stage erythroid precursors ( normoblasts ) in mice .
In models of β - thalassemia and MDS , luspatercept - aamt decreased abnormally elevated Smad2 / 3 signaling and improved hematology parameters associated with ineffective erythropoiesis in mice .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Increases in Hemoglobin in Patients with Low RBC Transfusion Burden In patients having received < 4 units of RBC transfusion within 8 weeks prior to study , hemoglobin increased within 7 days of initiating REBLOZYL and correlated with the time to luspatercept - aamt maximum serum concentration ( Cmax ) .
The greatest Hgb increase occurred after the first dose ; approximately 0 . 75 g / dL at a dose of 0 . 6 to 1 . 25 times the recommended starting dose for beta thalassemia , or approximately 1 g / dL at a dose of 0 . 75 to 1 . 75 times the recommended starting dose for MDS .
Additional smaller increases were observed after subsequent doses .
Hemoglobin levels returned to baseline approximately 6 to 8 weeks from the last dose following administration of luspatercept - aamt ( 0 . 6 to 1 . 75 mg / kg ) .
Increasing luspatercept - aamt serum exposure ( AUC ) was associated with greater Hgb increase in patients with beta thalassemia or MDS who had a baseline transfusion burden < 4 units / 8 weeks .
Increasing luspatercept - aamt serum exposure ( time - averaged AUC ) was associated with greater probability of achieving transfusion independence for at least 8 consecutive weeks in patients with MDS requiring transfusions ( ≥ 2 units of RBC transfusion within 8 weeks ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Luspatercept - aamt exhibited linear pharmacokinetics ( PK ) over the dose range of 0 . 2 to 1 . 25 mg / kg ( 0 . 2 to 1 . 25 times the recommended starting dosage ) in patients with beta thalassemia , and from 0 . 125 mg / kg to 1 . 75 mg / kg in patients with MDS .
The mean ( % coefficient of variation [ % CV ] ) steady - state AUC at the starting dose of 1 mg / kg was 126 ( 35 . 9 % ) day • µg / mL for patients with beta thalassemia and 145 ( 38 . 3 % ) day • µg / mL for patients with MDS .
Luspatercept - aamt serum concentration reached steady state after 3 doses when administered every 3 weeks .
The accumulation ratio of luspatercept - aamt was approximately 1 . 5 .
Absorption The median ( range ) time to maximum concentration ( Tmax ) of luspatercept - aamt was observed at approximately 7 [ 6 to 10 ] days post - dose in adult patients with beta thalassemia or 7 [ 5 to 21 ] days post - dose in adult patients with MDS .
The absorption of luspatercept - aamt was not significantly affected by the subcutaneous injection sites ( upper arm , thigh , or abdomen ) .
Distribution The mean ( % CV ) apparent volume of distribution ( Vd / F ) of luspatercept - aamt was 7 . 1 ( 26 . 7 % ) L for patients with beta thalassemia , and 9 . 7 ( 26 . 5 % ) L for patients with MDS .
Elimination The mean ( % CV ) half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of luspatercept - aamt was approximately 11 ( 25 . 7 % ) days and the mean ( % CV ) apparent total clearance ( CL / F ) was 0 . 44 ( 38 . 5 % ) L / day in patients with beta thalassemia .
The mean ( % CV ) t1 / 2 of luspatercept - aamt was approximately 13 ( 31 . 6 % ) days and the mean ( % CV ) CL / F was 0 . 52 ( 41 . 2 % ) L / day in patients with MDS .
Metabolism Luspatercept - aamt is expected to be catabolized into amino acids by general protein degradation processes in multiple tissues .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the luspatercept - aamt PK was observed based on age ( 18 to 95 years ) , sex , race / ethnicity ( Asian , White ) , mild to severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal [ ULN ] and aspartate aminotransaminase [ AST ] or alanine transaminase [ ALT ] > ULN , or total bilirubin > ULN and any AST or ALT ) , mild to moderate renal impairment ( estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] 30 to 89 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , baseline albumin ( 30 to 56 g / L ) , baseline serum erythropoietin ( 2 . 4 to 2450 U / L ) , red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion burden ( 0 to 43 units / 24 weeks ) , beta thalassemia genotype ( β0 / β0 vs . non - β0 / β0 ) , splenectomy , and ring sideroblasts status in MDS ( negative vs . positive ) .
The effect of AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and the effect of severe renal impairment ( eGFR < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) on luspatercept - aamt PK is unknown .
Body Weight The apparent CL / F and Vd / F of luspatercept - aamt increased with increasing body weight in patients with beta thalassemia ( 34 to 97 kg ) and in patients with MDS ( 46 to 124 kg ) .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Iron - chelating Agents on Luspatercept - aamt No clinically significant differences in luspatercept - aamt PK were observed when used concomitantly with iron - chelating agents .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity or mutagenicity studies have been conducted with luspatercept - aamt .
In a repeat - dose toxicity study , juvenile rats were administered luspatercept - aamt subcutaneously at 1 , 3 , or 10 mg / kg once every 2 weeks from postnatal day 7 to 91 .
Hematologic malignancies ( granulocytic leukemia , lymphocytic leukemia , malignant lymphoma ) were observed at 10 mg / kg resulting in exposures ( based on area under the curve [ AUC ] ) approximately 4 . 4 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 1 . 75 mg / kg .
In a combined male and female fertility and early embryonic development study in rats , luspatercept - aamt was administered subcutaneously to animals at doses of 1 to 15 mg / kg .
There were significant reductions in the average numbers of corpora lutea , implantations , and viable embryos in luspatercept - aamt - treated females .
Effects on female fertility were observed at the highest dose with exposures ( based on AUC ) approximately 7 - times the MRHD of 1 . 75 mg / kg .
Adverse effects on fertility in female rats were reversible after a 14 - week recovery period .
No adverse effects were noted in male rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Beta Thalassemia The efficacy of REBLOZYL was evaluated in adult patients with beta thalassemia in the BELIEVE trial ( NCT02604433 ) .
BELIEVE was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial in which ( n = 336 ) patients with beta thalassemia requiring regular red blood cell transfusions ( 6 - 20 RBC units per 24 weeks ) with no transfusion - free period greater than 35 days during that period were randomized 2 : 1 to REBLOZYL ( n = 224 ) or placebo ( n = 112 ) .
In BELIEVE , REBLOZYL was administered subcutaneously once every 3 weeks as long as a reduction in transfusion requirement was observed or until unacceptable toxicity .
All patients were eligible to receive best supportive care , which included RBC transfusions ; iron - chelating agents ; use of antibiotic , antiviral , and antifungal therapy ; and / or nutritional support , as needed .
The BELIEVE trial excluded patients with a diagnosis of Hemoglobin S / β - thalassemia or isolated alpha ( α ) - thalassemia ( e . g . , Hemoglobin H ) or who had major organ damage ( liver disease , heart disease , lung disease , renal insufficiency ) .
Patients with recent deep vein thrombosis or stroke or recent use of ESA , immunosuppressant , or hydroxyurea therapy were also excluded .
The median age was 30 years ( range : 18 - 66 ) .
The trial was comprised of patients who were 42 % male , 54 . 2 % White , 34 . 8 % Asian , and 0 . 3 % Black or African American .
The percent of patients reporting their race as “ other ” was 7 . 7 % , and race was not collected or reported for 3 % of patients .

For eligibility , patients were required to have had an inadequate response to prior treatment with an erythropoiesis - stimulating agent ( ESA ) , be intolerant of ESAs , or have a serum erythropoietin > 200 U / L .
The MEDALIST trial excluded patients with deletion 5 q ( del 5 q ) , white blood cell count > 13 Gi / L , neutrophils < 0 . 5 Gi / L , platelets < 50 Gi / L , or with prior use of a disease modifying agent for treatment of MDS .
The MEDALIST trial included 229 patients randomized 2 : 1 to REBLOZYL ( n = 153 ) or placebo ( n = 76 ) .
Randomization was stratified by baseline RBC transfusion burden and baseline IPSS - R .
Treatment was started at 1 mg / kg subcutaneously every 3 weeks ; the dose could be increased after completion of the first 2 cycles if the patient had at least one RBC transfusion in the prior 6 weeks .
Two dose level increases were allowed ( to 1 . 33 mg / kg and to 1 . 75 mg / kg ) .
Doses were held and subsequently reduced for adverse reactions , reduced if the hemoglobin increased by ≥ 2 g / dL from the prior cycle , and held if the predose hemoglobin was ≥ 11 . 5 g / dL .
All patients received best supportive care , which included RBC transfusions as needed .
The primary efficacy assessment was conducted after completion of 24 weeks on study drug .
Patients with a decrease in transfusion requirement or increase in hemoglobin could continue on blinded study drug thereafter until unacceptable toxicity , loss of efficacy , or disease progression .
The median age of the 229 study participants was 71 years ( range : 26 , 95 years ) .
The trial population was 63 % male and 69 % White .
