M . FACTS ABOUT PERSPIRATION PROBLEMS What causes perspiration ?
Any of the following factors , separately or in combination , can cause varying amounts of perspiration : physical exertion ; mental or emotional stress ; warm or hot temperatures ; nonporous , heavy clothing ; obesity or endocrine dysfunction ; inherited factors .
Why does perspiration occur ?
When your body “ overheats ” as a result of any of the above factors , it activates the sweat glands , especially those in the underarm area ( axillary glands ) , to produce perspiration which is emitted through your skin pores .
The perspiration then evaporates to produce a cooling effect , thereby reducing the body ' s skin temperature .
What causes underarm odor ?
In its freshly released state , perspiration is generally odorless .
However , when it exists in a confined and damp underarm area , it decomposes and causes odor - producing bacteria to form .
Combined with natural salt and uric acid which are also emitted through the pores , the perspiration then takes on its familiar unpleasant odor .
What is a deodorant ?
A deodorant is any kind of fragrance used to cover up or deodorize one odor with another .
While perfumes are generally used , some people resort to herb , fruit or musk aromas to disguise underarm odor .
Rarely , however , can a deodorant inhibit perspiration or retard bacterial growth and odor for more than a very brief time .
What is an anti - perspirant ?
A true anti - perspirant , as its name implies , should - like Certain Dri ® - shrink and close off underarm pores to inhibit the flow of perspiration .
The more effective the formulation , the more effective and longer lasting the anti - perspirant relief will be .
Generally an anti - perspirant is also a deodorant because it prevents perspiration which is the source of odor - causing bacteria .
However , a deodorant is not an anti - perspirant .
Is it safe to close off underarm pores ?
Yes .
Both underarms represent an area of only about 6 to 8 sq . in .
Nature simply and safely redistributes the perspiration around to the other 2 , 700 ± sq . in .
of the body ’ s skin surface .
