DESCRIPTION Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets USP are oral antihyperglycemic drugs used in the management of type 2 diabetes .
Metformin Hydrochloride ( N , N - dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide Hydrochloride ) is not chemically or pharmacologically related to any other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents .
The structural formula is as shown : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Metformin Hydrochloride is a white to off - white crystalline compound with a molecular formula of C 4 H 11 N 5 • HCl and a molecular weight of 165 . 63 .
Metformin Hydrochloride is freely soluble in water and is practically insoluble in acetone , ether , and chloroform .
The pK a of metformin is 12 . 4 .
The pH of a 1 % aqueous solution of metformin Hydrochloride is 6 . 68 .
Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets USP contain 500 mg or 750 mg of Metformin Hydrochloride USP as the active ingredient .
Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets USP 500 mg and 750 mg contain the inactive ingredients microcrystalline cellulose , hypromellose , povidone , sodium carboxymethyl cellulose , and magnesium stearate .
System Components and Performance - Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets USP comprises a duel hydrophilic polymer matrix system .
Metformin hydrochloride is combined with a drug release controlling polymers to form a monophasic matrix system .
After administration , fluid from the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract enters the tablet , causing the polymers to hydrate and swell .
Drug is released slowly from the dosage form by a process of diffusion through the gel matrix that is essentially independent of pH . The hydrated polymer system is not rigid and is expected to be broken up by normal peristalsis in the GI tract .
The biologically inert components of the tablet may occasionally remain intact during GI transit and will be eliminated in the feces as a soft , hydrated mass .
The USP Dissolution Test is pending .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes , lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose .
Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents .
Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production , decreases intestinal absorption of glucose , and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization .
Unlike sulfonylureas , metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects ( except in special circumstances , see PRECAUTIONS ) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia .
With metformin therapy , insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day - long plasma insulin response may actually decrease .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability The absolute bioavailability of a Metformin Hydrochloride 500 mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50 % to 60 % .
Studies using single oral doses of Metformin Hydrochloride 500 to 1500 mg , and 850 to 2550 mg , indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses , which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination .
Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin , as shown by approximately a 40 % lower mean peak plasma concentration ( C max ) , a 25 % lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) , and a 35 - minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration ( T max ) following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin with food , compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting .
The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown .
Following a single oral dose of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release tablet , C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours .
Peak plasma levels are approximately 20 % lower compared to the same dose of Metformin Hydrochloride tablet , however , the extent of absorption ( as measured by AUC ) is similar to Metformin Hydrochloride tablet .
At steady state , the AUC and C max are less than dose proportional for Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets within the range of 500 to 2000 mg administered once daily .
Peak plasma levels are approximately 0 . 6 , 1 . 1 , 1 . 4 , and 1 . 8 mcg / mL for 500 , 1000 , 1500 , and 2000 mg once - daily doses , respectively .
The extent of metformin absorption ( as measured by AUC ) from Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release tablet at a 2000 mg once - daily dose is similar to the same total daily dose administered as Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets 1000 mg twice daily .
After repeated administration of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets , metformin did not accumulate in plasma .
Within - subject variability in C max and AUC of metformin from Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets is comparable to that with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets .
Although the extent of metformin absorption ( as measured by AUC ) from the Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets increased by approximately 50 % when given with food , there was no effect of food on C max and T max of metformin .
Both high and low fat meals had the same effect on the pharmacokinetics of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution ( V / F ) of metformin following single oral doses of Metformin Hydrochloride 850 mg averaged 654 ± 358 L . Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins , in contrast to sulfonylureas , which are more than 90 % protein bound .
Metformin partitions into erythrocytes , most likely as a function of time .
At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets , steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally < 1 mcg / mL .
During controlled clinical trials of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets , maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 mcg / mL , even at maximum doses .
Metabolism and Elimination Intravenous single - dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism ( no metabolites have been identified in humans ) nor biliary excretion .
Renal clearance ( see Table 1 ) is approximately 3 . 5 times greater than creatinine clearance , which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination .
Following oral administration , approximately 90 % of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours , with a plasma elimination half - life of approximately 6 . 2 hours .
In blood , the elimination half - life is approximately 17 . 6 hours , suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution .
Special Populations Patients with Type 2 Diabetes In the presence of normal renal function , there are no differences between single - or multiple - dose pharmacokinetics of metformin between patients with type 2 diabetes and normal subjects ( see Table 1 ) , nor is there any accumulation of metformin in either group at usual clinical doses .
The pharmacokinetics of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes are comparable to those in healthy normal adults .
Renal Insufficiency In patients with decreased renal function ( based on measured creatinine clearance ) , the plasma and blood half - life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance ( see Table 1 ; also see WARNINGS ) .
Hepatic Insufficiency No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic insufficiency .
Geriatrics Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased , the half - life is prolonged , and C max is increased , compared to healthy young subjects .
From these data , it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function ( see Table 1 ) .
Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced ( see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .

Gender Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes when analyzed according to gender ( males = 19 , females = 16 ) .
Similarly , in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes , the antihyperglycemic effect of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets was comparable in males and females .
Race No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed .
In controlled clinical studies of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes , the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in whites ( n = 249 ) , blacks ( n = 51 ) , and Hispanics ( n = 24 ) .
Clinical Studies Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets In a double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter US clinical trial involving obese patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia was not adequately controlled with dietary management alone ( baseline fasting plasma glucose [ FPG ] of approximately 240 mg / dL ) , treatment with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets ( up to 2550 mg / day ) for 29 weeks resulted in significant mean net reductions in fasting and postprandial plasma glucose ( PPG ) and hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) of 59 mg / dL , 83 mg / dL , and 1 . 8 % , respectively , compared to the placebo group ( see Table 2 ) .

Patients randomized to the combination armstarted therapy with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets 500 mgand glyburide 20 mg .
At the end of each week of the first 4 weeks of the trial , these patients had theirdosages of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets increased by 500 mg if they had failed to reach target fasting plasma glucose .
After week 4 , such dosage adjustments were made monthly , although no patient was allowed toexceed Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets 2500 mg .
Patients in the Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets only arm ( metformin plus placebo ) followed the same titration schedule .
At the end of the trial , approximately 70 % of the patients in the combination group were taking Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets 2000 mg / glyburide 20 mg or Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets 2500 mg / glyburide 20 mg .
Patients randomized to continue on glyburide experienced worsening of glycemiccontrol , with mean increases in FPG , PPG , and HbA1c of 14 mg / dL , 3 mg / dL , and 0 . 2 % , respectively .
Incontrast , those randomized to Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets ( up to 2500 mg / day ) experienced a slight improvement , with mean reductions in FPG , PPG , and HbA1c of 1 mg / dL , 6 mg / dL , and 0 . 4 % , respectively .
The combination of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets and glyburide was effective in reducing FPG , PPG , and HbA1c levels by 63 mg / dL , 65 mg / dL , and 1 . 7 % , respectively .
Compared to results of glyburide treatment alone , the net differences with combination treatment were – 77 mg / dL , – 68 mg / dL , and – 1 . 9 % , respectively ( see Table 3 ) .

In addition , this study demonstrated that the combination of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets plus insulin resulted in reduction in body weight of 3 . 11 ± 4 . 30 lbs , compared to an increase of 1 . 30 ± 6 . 08 lbs for placebo plus insulin , p = 0 . 01 .
Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets A 24 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled study of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets , taken once daily with the evening meal , was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes who had failed to achieve glycemic control with diet and exercise ( HbA ic 7 . 0 % - 10 . 0 % , FPG 126 - 270 mg / dL ) .
Patients entering the study had a mean baseline HbA ic of 8 . 0 % and a mean baseline FPG of 176 mg / dL .
After 12 weeks treatment , mean HbA1c had increased from baseline by 0 . 1 % and mean FPG decreased from baseline by 2 mg / dL in the placebo group , compared with a decrease in mean HbA ic of 0 . 6 % and a decrease in mean FPG of 23 mg / dL in patients treated with Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release 1000 mg tablet once daily .
Subsequently , the treatment dose was increased to 1500 mg once daily if HbA ic was ≥ 7 . 0 % but < 8 . 0 % ( patients with HbA ic ≥ 8 . 0 % were discontinued from the study ) .
At the final visit ( 24 - week ) , mean HbA ic had increased 0 . 2 % from baseline in placebo patients and decreased 0 . 6 % with Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets .
A 16 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled , dose - response study of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets , taken once daily with the evening meal or twice daily with meals , was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes who had failed to achieve glycemic control with diet and exercise ( HbA 1 c 7 . 0 % - 11 . 0 % , FPG 126 - 280 mg / dL ) .

CONTRAINDICATIONS Metformin Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with : • Renal disease or renal dysfunction ( e . g . , as suggested by serum creatinine levels ≥ 1 . 5 mg / dL [ males ] , ≥ 1 . 4 mg / dL [ females ] or abnormal creatinine clearance ) which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse ( shock ) , acute myocardial infarction , and septicemia ( see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) .
• Known hypersensitivity to Metformin Hydrochloride .
• Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis , including diabetic ketoacidosis , with or without coma .
Diabetic ketoacidosis should be treated with insulin .
Metformin Hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued in patients undergoing radiologic studies involving intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials , because use of such products may result in acute alteration of renal function .
( See also PRECAUTIONS . )
WARNINGS Lactic Acidosis : Lactic acidosis is a rare , but serious , metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with Metformin Hydrochloride ; when it occurs , it is fatal in approximately 50 % of cases .
Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions , including diabetes mellitus , and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia .
Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels ( > 5 mmol / L ) , decreased blood pH , electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap , and an increased lactate / pyruvate ratio .
When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis , metformin plasma levels > 5 μg / mL are generally found .
The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin Hydrochloride is very low ( approximately 0 . 03 cases / 1000 patient - years , with approximately 0 . 015 fatal cases / 1000 patientyears ) .
In more than 20 , 000 patient - years exposure to metformin in clinical trials , there were no reports of lactic acidosis .
Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency , including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion , often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical / surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications .
Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management , in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia , are at increased risk of lactic acidosis .
The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient ' s age .
The risk of lactic acidosis may , therefore , be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride by use of the minimum effective dose of Metformin Hydrochloride .
In particular , treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function .
Metformin Hydrochloride treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced , as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis .
In addition , Metformin Hydrochloride should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia , dehydration , or sepsis .
Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate , Metformin Hydrochloride should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease .
Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake , either acute or chronic , when taking Metformin Hydrochloride , since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin Hydrochloride on lactate metabolism .
In addition , Metformin Hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure ( see also PRECAUTIONS ) .
The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle , and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise , myalgias , respiratory distress , increasing somnolence , and nonspecific abdominal distress .
There may be associated hypothermia , hypotension , and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis .
The patient and the patient ' s physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur ( see also PRECAUTIONS ) .
Metformin Hydrochloride should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified .
Serum electrolytes , ketones , blood glucose , and if indicated , blood pH , lactate levels , and even blood metformin levels may be useful .
Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of Metformin Hydrochloride , gastrointestinal symptoms , which are common during initiation of therapy , are unlikely to be drug related .
Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease .
Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol / L in patients taking Metformin Hydrochloride do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms , such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity , vigorous physical activity , or technical problems in sample handling .
( See also PRECAUTIONS . )
Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis ( ketonuria and ketonemia ) .
Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting .
In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking Metformin Hydrochloride , the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted .
Because metformin Hydrochloride is dialyzable ( with a clearance of up to 170 mL / min under good hemodynamic conditions ) , prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin .
Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery .
( See also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS . )
PRECAUTIONS General Macrovascular Outcomes - There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride or any other antidiabetic drug .
Monitoring of renal function - Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function .
Thus , patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive metformin hydrochloride .
In patients with advanced age , metformin hydrochloride should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect , because aging is associated with reduced renal function .
In elderly patients , particularly those ≥ 80 years of age , renal function should be monitored regularly and , generally , metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets should not be titrated to the maximum dose ( see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Before initiation of metformin hydrochloride therapy and at least annually hereafter , renal function should be assessed and verified as normal .
In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated , renal function should be assessed more frequently and metformin hydrochloride discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present .
Use of concomitant medications that may affect renal function or metformin disposition - Concomitant medication ( s ) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or may interfere with the disposition of metformin , such as cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion ( see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ) , should be used with caution .
Radiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials ( for example , intravenous urogram , intravenous cholangiography , angiography , and computed tomography ( CT ) scans with intravascular contrast materials ) - Intravascular contrast studies with iodinated materials can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Therefore , in patients in whom any such study is planned , metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure , and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re - evaluated and found to be normal .
Hypoxic states - Cardiovascular collapse ( shock ) from whatever cause , acute congestive heart failure , acute myocardial infarction and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia .
When such events occur in patients on metformin hydrochloride therapy , the drug should be promptly discontinued .
Surgical procedures - Metformin hydrochloride therapy should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure ( except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids ) and should not be restarted until the patient ' s oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal .
Alcohol intake - Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism .
Patients , therefore , should be warned against excessive alcohol intake , acute or chronic , while receiving metformin hydrochloride .
Impaired hepatic function - Since impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis , metformin hydrochloride should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease .
Vitamin B 12 levels - In controlled clinical trials of metformin Hydrochloride Tablets of 29 weeks duration , a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels , without clinical manifestations , was observed in approximately 7 % of patients .
Such decrease , possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 - intrinsic factor complex , is , however , very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin Hydrochloride Tablets or vitamin B 12 supplementation .
Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on metformin hydrochloride and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed ( see PRECAUTIONS : Laboratory Tests ) .
Certain individuals ( those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption ) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels .
In these patients , routine serum vitamin B 12 measurements at two - to three year intervals may be useful .
Change in clinical status of patients with previously controlled type 2 diabetes - A patient with type 2 diabetes previously well controlled on metformin hydrochloride who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness ( especially vague and poorly defined illness ) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis .
Evaluation should include serum electrolytes and ketones , blood glucose and , if indicated , blood pH , lactate , pyruvate , and metformin levels .
If acidosis of either form occurs , metformin hydrochloride must be stopped immediately and other appropriate corrective measures initiated ( see also WARNINGS ) .
Hypoglycemia - Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets alone under usual circumstances of use , but could occur when caloric intake is deficient , when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation , or during concomitant use with other glucose - lowering agents ( such as sulfonylureas and insulin ) or ethanol .
Elderly , debilitated , or malnourished patients , and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects .
Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly , and in people who are taking beta - adrenergic blocking drugs .
Loss of control of blood glucose - When a patient stabilized on any diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever , trauma , infection , or surgery , a temporary loss of glycemic control may occur .
At such times , it may be necessary to withhold metformin hydrochloride and temporarily administer insulin .
Metformin hydrochloride may be reinstituted after the acute episode is resolved .
The effectiveness of oral antidiabetic drugs in lowering blood glucose to a targeted level decreases in many patients over a period of time .
This phenomenon , which may be due to progression of the underlying disease or to diminished responsiveness to the drug , is known as secondary failure , to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective during initial therapy .
Should secondary failure occur with either metformin hydrochloride or sulfonylurea monotherapy , combined therapy with metformin hydrochloride and sulfonylurea may result in a response .
Should secondary failure occur with combined metformin hydrochloride / sulfonylurea therapy , it may be necessary to consider therapeutic alternatives including initiation of insulin therapy .
Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the potential risks and benefits of metformin hydrochloride and of alternative modes of therapy .
They should also be informed about the importance of adherence to dietary instructions , of a regular exercise program , and of regular testing of blood glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin , renal function , and hematologic parameters .
The risks of lactic acidosis , its symptoms , and conditions that predispose to its development , as noted in the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections , should be explained to patients .
Patients should be advised to discontinue metformin hydrochloride immediately and to promptly notify their health practitioner if unexplained hyperventilation , myalgia , malaise , unusual somnolence , or other nonspecific symptoms occur .
Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride , gastrointestinal symptoms , which are common during initiation of metformin therapy , are unlikely to be drug related .
Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease .
Patients should be counselled against excessive alcohol intake , either acute or chronic , while receiving metformin hydrochloride .
Metformin hydrochloride alone does not usually cause hypoglycemia , although it may occur when metformin hydrochloride are used in conjunction with oral sulfonylureas and insulin .
When initiating combination therapy , the risks of hypoglycemia , its symptoms and treatment , and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible family members .
( See Patient Information printed below . )
Patients should be informed that metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets must be swallowed whole and not crushed or chewed , and that the inactive ingredients may occasionally be eliminated in the feces as a soft mass that may resemble the original tablet .
Laboratory Tests Response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic measurements of fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels , with a goal of decreasing these levels toward the normal range .
During initial dose titration , fasting glucose can be used to determine the therapeutic response .
Thereafter , both glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin should be monitored .
Measurements of glycosylated hemoglobin may be especially useful for evaluating long - term control ( see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Initial and periodic monitoring of hematologic parameters ( e . g . , hemoglobin / hematocrit and red blood cell indices ) and renal function ( serum creatinine ) should be performed , at least on an annual basis .
While megaloblastic anemia has rarely been seen with metformin hydrochloride tablet therapy , if this is suspected , vitamin B 12 deficiency should be excluded .
Drug Interactions ( Clinical Evaluation of Drug Interactions Conducted with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets ) Glyburide - In a single - dose interaction study in type 2 diabetes patients , coadministration of metformin and glyburide did not result in any changes in either metformin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics .
Decreases in glyburide AUC and C max were observed , but were highly variable .
The single - dose nature of this study and the lack of correlation between glyburide blood levels and pharmacodynamic effects , makes the clinical significance of this interaction uncertain ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients ) .
Furosemide - A single - dose , metformin - furosemide drug interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds were affected by coadministration .
Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood C max by 22 % and blood AUC by 15 % , without any significant change in metformin renal clearance .
When administered with metformin , the C max and AUC of furosemide were 31 % and 12 % smaller , respectively , than when administered alone , and the terminal half - life was decreased by 32 % , without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance .
No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when coadministered chronically .
Nifedipine - A single - dose , metformin - nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin C max and AUC by 20 % and 9 % , respectively , and increased the amount excreted in the urine .
T max and half - life were unaffected .
Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin .
Metformin had minimal effects on nifedipine .
Cationic drugs - Cationic drugs ( e . g . , amiloride , digoxin , morphine , procainamide , quinidine , quinine , ranitidine , triamterene , trimethoprim , or vancomycin ) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems .
Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single - and multiple - dose , metformin - cimetidine drug interaction studies , with a 60 % increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40 % increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC .
There was no change in elimination half - life in the single - dose study .
Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics .
Although such interactions remain theoretical ( except for cimetidine ) , careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin hydrochloride and / or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system .
Other - Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control .
These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics , corticosteroids , phenothiazines , thyroid products , estrogens , oral contraceptives , phenytoin , nicotinic acid , sympathomimetics , calcium channel blocking drugs , and isoniazid .
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving metformin hydrochloride , the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control .
When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving metformin hydrochloride , the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia .
In healthy volunteers , the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol , and metformin and ibuprofen were not affected when coadministered in single - dose interaction studies .
Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is , therefore , less likely to interact with highly protein - bound drugs such as salicylates , sulfonamides , chloramphenicol , and probenecid , as compared to the sulfonylureas , which are extensively bound to serum proteins .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats ( dosing duration of 104 weeks ) and mice ( dosing duration of 91 weeks ) at doses up to and including 900 mg / kg / day and 1500 mg / kg / day , respectively .
These doses are both approximately four times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons .
No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice .
Similarly , there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats .
There was , however , an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg / kg / day .
There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests : Ames test ( S . typhimurium ) , gene mutation test ( mouse lymphoma cells ) , or chromosomal aberrations test ( human lymphocytes ) .
Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative .
Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg / kg / day , which is approximately three times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Recent information strongly suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities .
Most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , metformin hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly needed .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women with metformin hydrochloride .
Metformin was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg / kg / day .
This represents an exposure of about two and six times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits , respectively .
Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin .
Nursing Mothers Studies in lactating rats show that metformin is excreted into milk and reaches levels comparable to those in plasma .
Similar studies have not been conducted in nursing mothers .
Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
If metformin hydrochloride are discontinued , and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose , insulin therapy should be considered .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have been established in pediatric patients ages 10 to 16 years ( studies have not been conducted in pediatric patients below the age of 10 years ) .
Use of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in adults with additional data from a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients ages 10 to 16 years with type 2 diabetes , which demonstrated a similar response in glycemic control to that seen in adults .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pediatric Clinical Studies . )
In this study , adverse effects were similar to those described in adults .
( See ADVERSE REACTIONS : Pediatric Patients . )
A maximum daily dose of 2000 mg is recommended .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Recommended Dosing Schedule : Pediatrics . )
Safety and effectiveness of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use Controlled clinical studies of metformin hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients , although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and because the risk of serious adverse reactions to the drug is greater in patients with impaired renal function , metformin hydrochloride should only be used in patients with normal renal function ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics ) .
Because aging is associated with reduced renal function , metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets should be used with caution as age increases .
Care should be taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal function .
Generally , elderly patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride ( see also WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS In a US double - blind clinical study of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes , a total of 141 patients received Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets therapy ( up to 2550 mg per day ) and 145 patients received placebo . Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5 % of the Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets patients , and that were more common in Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets - than placebo - treated patients , are listed in Table 11 ..

Additionally , the following adverse reactions were reported in ≥ 1 . 0 % to ≤ 5 . 0 % of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets patients and were more commonly reported with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets than placebo : abnormal stools , hypoglycemia , myalgia , lightheaded , dyspnea , nail disorder , rash , sweating increased , taste disorder , chest discomfort , chills , flu syndrome , flushing , palpitation .
In worldwide clinical trials over 900 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets in placebo - and active - controlled studies .
In placebo - controlled trials , 781 patients were administered Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets and 195 patients received placebo .
Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5 % of the Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets patients , and that were more common in Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets - than placebo - treated patients , are listed in Table 12 .

Additionally , the following adverse reactions were reported in ≥ 1 . 0 % to ≤ 5 . 0 % of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets patients and were more commonly reported with Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets than placebo : abdominal pain , constipation , distention abdomen , dyspepsia / heartburn , flatulence , dizziness , headache , upper respiratory infection , taste disturbance .
Liver function test abnormalities or hepatitis , resolving upon metformin discontinuation , have been reported very rarely .
Pediatric Patients In clinical trials with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes , the profile of adverse reactions was similar to that observed in adults .
OVERDOSAGE Overdose of metformin hydrochloride has occurred , including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams .
Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10 % of cases , but no causal association with metformin Hydrochloride has been established .
Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32 % of metformin overdose cases ( see WARNINGS ) .
Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL / min under good hemodynamic conditions .
Therefore , hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes with Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets or any other pharmacologic agent .
Dosage of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance , while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses .
The maximum recommended daily dose of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets in adults is 2000 mg .
Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets should generally be given once daily with the evening meal .
Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets should be started at a low dose , with gradual dose escalation , both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient .
During treatment initiation and dose titration ( see Recommended Dosing Schedule ) , fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient .
Thereafter , glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months .
The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin .
Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure , i . e . , inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication , and secondary failure , i . e . , loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness .
Short - term administration of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well - controlled on diet alone .
Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed .
Occasionally , the inactive ingredients of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets will be eliminated in the feces as a soft , hydrated mass .
( See Patient Information printed below . )
Recommended Dosing Schedule Adults In general , clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day .
However , a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms .
The usual starting dose of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets is 500 mg once daily with the evening meal .
Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly , up to a maximum of 2000 mg once daily with the evening meal .
If glycemic control is not achieved on Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets 2000 mg once daily , a trial of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets 1000 mg twice daily should be considered .
If higher doses of metformin are required , Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets should be used at total daily doses up to 2550 mg administered in divided daily doses , as described above .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Clinical Studies . )
In a randomized trial , patients currently treated with Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets were switched to Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets .
Results of this trial suggest that patients receiving Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets treatment may be safely switched to Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets once daily at the same total daily dose , up to 2000 mg once daily .
Following a switch from Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets to Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets , glycemic control should be closely monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Clinical Studies ) .
Pediatrics Safety and effectiveness Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established .
Transfer from Other Antidiabetic Therapy When transferring patients from standard oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets , no transition period generally is necessary .
When transferring patients from chlorpropamide , care should be exercised during the first 2 weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide in the body , leading to overlapping drug effects and possible hypoglycemia .
Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients If patients have not responded to 4 weeks of the maximum dose of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets monotherapy , consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets at the maximum dose , even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred .
Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug - drug interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide ( glibenclamide ) .
With concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets and sulfonylurea therapy , the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug .
However , attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal .
With concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets and sulfonylurea therapy , the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea therapy continues and may be increased .
Appropriate precautions should be taken .
( See Package Insert of the respective sulfonylurea . )
If patients have not satisfactorily responded to 1 to 3 months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets and the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea , consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets .
Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets and Insulin Therapy in Adult Patients The current insulin dose should be continued upon initiation of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets therapy .
Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy .
For patients not responding adequately , the dose of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved .
The maximum recommended daily dose is 2000 mg for Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets .
It is recommended that the insulin dose be decreased by 10 % to 25 % when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to less than 120 mg / dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets .
Further adjustment should be individualized based on glucose - lowering response .
Specific Patient Populations Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets are not recommended for use in pregnancy .
Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets is not recommended in pediatric patients ( below the age of 17 years ) .
The initial and maintenance dosing of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets should be conservative in patients with advanced age , due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population .
Any dosage adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function .
Generally , elderly , debilitated , and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - release Tablets .
Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of lactic acidosis , particularly in the elderly .

What is Metformin Hydrochloride ?
Metformin Hydrochloride is used to treat type 2 diabetes .
This is also known as non - insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus .
People with type 2 diabetes are not able to make enough insulin or respond normally to the insulin their bodies make .
When this happens , sugar ( glucose ) builds up in the blood .
This can lead to serious medical problems including kidney damage , amputations , and blindness .
Diabetes is also closely linked to heart disease .
The main goal of treating diabetes is to lower your blood sugar to a normal level .
High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise , by a number of medicines taken by mouth , and by insulin shots .
Before you take Metformin Hydrochloride , try to control your diabetes by exercise and weight loss .
While you take your diabetes medicine , continue to exercise and follow the diet advised for your diabetes .
No matter what your recommended diabetes management plan is , studies have shown that maintaining good blood sugar control can prevent or delay complications of diabetes , such as blindness .
This medicine helps control your blood sugar in a number of ways .
These include helping your body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally , decreasing the amount of sugar your liver makes , and decreasing the amount of sugar your intestines absorb .
Metformin Hydrochloride does not cause your body to make more insulin .
Because of this , when taken alone , they rarely cause hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) , and usually do not cause weight gain .
However , when they are taken with a sulfonylurea or with insulin , hypoglycemia is more likely to occur , as is weight gain .
