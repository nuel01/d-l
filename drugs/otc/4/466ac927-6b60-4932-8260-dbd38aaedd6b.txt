DESCRIPTIONMegace ® ES ( megestrol acetate ) oral suspension contains megestrol acetate , a synthetic derivative of the naturally occurring steroid hormone , progesterone .
Megestrol acetate is a white , crystalline solid chemically designated as 17 - Hydroxy - 6 - methylpregna - 4 , 6 - diene - 3 , 20 - dione acetate .
Solubility at 37 ° C in water is 2 mcg per mL , solubility in plasma is 24 mcg per mL .
Its molecular weight is 384 . 52 .
The chemical formula is C24H32O4 and the structural formula is represented as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Megace ® ES ( megestrol acetate ) is a concentrated formula supplied as an oral suspension containing 125 mg of megestrol acetate per mL .
Megace ® ES ( megestrol acetate ) oral suspension contains the following inactive ingredients : alcohol ( max 0 . 06 % v / v from flavor ) , artificial lime flavor , citric acid monohydrate , docusate sodium , hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ( hypromellose ) , natural and artificial lemon flavor , purified water , sodium benzoate , sodium citrate dihydrate , and sucrose .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYThere are several analytical methods used to estimate megestrol acetate plasma concentrations , including gas chromatography - mass fragmentography ( GC - MF ) , high pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) and radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) .
The GC - MF and HPLC methods are specific for megestrol acetate and yield equivalent concentrations .
The RIA method reacts to megestrol acetate metabolites and is , therefore , non - specific and indicates higher concentrations than the GC - MF and HPLC methods .
Plasma concentrations are dependent , not only on the method used , but also on intestinal and hepatic inactivation of the drug , which may be affected by factors such as intestinal tract motility , intestinal bacteria , antibiotics administered , body weight , diet and liver function .
Mechanism of ActionSeveral investigators have reported on the appetite enhancing property of megestrol acetate and its possible use in cachexia .
The precise mechanism by which megestrol acetate produces effects in anorexia and cachexia is unknown at the present time .
Pharmacokinetic Properties : Plasma concentrations of megestrol acetate after administration of 625 mg ( 125 mg / mL ) of Megace ® ES oral suspension are equivalent under fed conditions to 800 mg ( 40 mg / mL ) of megestrol acetate oral suspension ( see figure below ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] In order to characterize the dose proportionality of Megace ® ES , pharmacokinetic studies across a range of doses were conducted when administered under fasting and fed conditions .
Pharmacokinetics of megestrol was linear in the dosing range between 150 mg and 675 mg after Megace ® ES administration regardless of meal condition .
The Cmax and AUC under a high fat meal were increased by 48 % and 36 % , respectively , compared to those under the fasting after 625 mg Megace ® ES administration ( Table 1 ) .
However , a high fat meal significantly increased AUC and Cmax of megestrol to 2 - fold and 7 - fold , respectively , compared to those under fasting condition after administration of 800 mg in the original formulation .
There was no difference in safety following administration in the fed state , therefore Megace ® ES could be taken without regard to meals .

Patients received single oral doses of 800 mg / day of megestrol acetate oral suspension for 21 days .
Plasma concentration data obtained on day 21 were evaluated for up to 48 hours past the last dose .
Mean ( ± 1 SD ) peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) of megestrol acetate was 753 ( ± 539 ) ng / mL .
Mean area under the concentration time - curve ( AUC ) was 10476 ( ± 7788 ) ng x hr / mL .
Median Tmax value was five hours .
Seven of 10 patients gained weight in three weeks .
Additionally , 24 adult , asymptomatic HIV seropositive male subjects were dosed once daily with 750 mg of megestrol acetate oral suspension .
The treatment was administered for 14 days .
Mean Cmax and AUC values were 490 ( ± 238 ) ng / mL and 6779 ( ± 3048 ) hr x ng / mL , respectively .
The median Tmax value was three hours .
The mean Cmax value was 202 ( ± 101 ) ng / mL .
The mean % of fluctuation value was 107 ( ± 40 ) .
MetabolismMegestrol acetate metabolites which were identified in urine constituted 5 % to 8 % of the dose administered .
Respiratory excretion as labeled carbon dioxide and fat storage may have accounted for at least part of the radioactivity not found in urine and feces .
EliminationThe major route of drug elimination in humans is urine .
When radiolabeled megestrol acetate was administered to humans in doses of 4 to 90 mg , the urinary excretion within 10 days ranged from 56 . 5 % to 78 . 4 % ( mean 66 . 4 % ) and fecal excretion ranged from 7 . 7 % to 30 . 3 % ( mean 19 . 8 % ) .
The total recovered radioactivity varied between 83 . 1 % and 94 . 7 % ( mean 86 . 2 % ) .
Special PopulationsThe pharmacokinetics of megestrol acetate has not been studied in any special populations .
ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND / OR TOXICOLOGYLong - term treatment with Megace ® ES ( megestrol acetate ) may increase the risk of respiratory infections .
A trend toward increased frequency of respiratory infections , decreased lymphocyte counts and increased neutrophil counts was observed in a two - year chronic toxicity / carcinogenicity study of megestrol acetate conducted in rats .
DESCRIPTION OF CLINICAL STUDIESMegestrol acetate oral suspension at a dose of 800 mg / 20 mL is equivalent to 625 mg / 5 mL of Megace ® ES .
The clinical efficacy of megestrol acetate oral suspension was assessed in two clinical trials .
One was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study comparing megestrol acetate ( MA ) at doses of 100 mg , 400 mg , and 800 mg per day versus placebo in AIDS patients with anorexia / cachexia and significant weight loss .
Of the 270 patients entered on study , 195 met all inclusion / exclusion criteria , had at least two additional post baseline weight measurements over a 12 week period or had one post baseline weight measurement but dropped out for therapeutic failure .
The percent of patients gaining five or more pounds at maximum weight gain in 12 study weeks was statistically significantly greater for the 800 mg ( 64 % ) and 400 mg ( 57 % ) MA - treated groups than for the placebo group ( 24 % ) .
Mean weight increased from baseline to last evaluation in 12 study weeks in the 800 mg MA - treated group by 7 . 8 pounds , the 400 mg MA group by 4 . 2 pounds , the 100 mg MA group by 1 . 9 pounds and decreased in the placebo group by 1 . 6 pounds .
Mean weight changes at 4 , 8 and 12 weeks for patients evaluable for efficacy in the two clinical trials are shown graphically .
Changes in body composition during the 12 study weeks as measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis showed increases in non - water body weight in the MA - treated groups ( see clinical studies table ) .
In addition , edema developed or worsened in only 3 patients .
Greater percentages of MA - treated patients in the 800 mg group ( 89 % ) , the 400 mg group ( 68 % ) and the 100 mg group ( 72 % ) , than in the placebo group ( 50 % ) , showed an improvement in appetite at last evaluation during the 12 study weeks .
A statistically significant difference was observed between the 800 mg MA - treated group and the placebo group in the change in caloric intake from baseline to time of maximum weight change .
Patients were asked to assess weight change , appetite , appearance , and overall perception of well - being in a 9 question survey .
At maximum weight change only the 800 mg MA - treated group gave responses that were statistically significantly more favorable to all questions when compared to the placebo - treated group .
A dose response was noted in the survey with positive responses correlating with higher dose for all questions .
The second trial was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study comparing megestrol acetate 800 mg / day versus placebo in AIDS patients with anorexia / cachexia and significant weight loss .
Of the 100 patients entered on study , 65 met all inclusion / exclusion criteria , had at least two additional post baseline weight measurements over a 12 week period or had one post baseline weight measurement but dropped out for therapeutic failure .
Patients in the 800 mg MA - treated group had a statistically significantly larger increase in mean maximum weight change than patients in the placebo group .
From baseline to study week 12 , mean weight increased by 11 . 2 pounds in the MA - treated group and decreased 2 . 1 pounds in the placebo group .
Changes in body composition as measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis showed increases in non - water weight in the MA - treated group ( see clinical studies table ) .
No edema was reported in the MA - treated group .
A greater percentage of MA - treated patients ( 67 % ) than placebo - treated patients ( 38 % ) showed an improvement in appetite at last evaluation during the 12 study weeks ; this difference was statistically significant .
There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in mean caloric change or in daily caloric intake at time to maximum weight change .
In the same 9 question survey referenced in the first trial , patients ’ assessments of weight change , appetite , appearance , and overall perception of well - being showed increases in mean scores in MA - treated patients as compared to the placebo group .
In both trials , patients tolerated the drug well and no statistically significant differences were seen between the treatment groups with regard to laboratory abnormalities , new opportunistic infections , lymphocyte counts , T4 counts , T8 counts , or skin reactivity tests ( see ADVERSEREACTIONS section ) .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] INDICATIONS AND USAGEMegace ® ES ( megestrol acetate ) oral suspension is indicated for the treatment of anorexia , cachexia , or an unexplained , significant weight loss in patients with a diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
CONTRAINDICATIONSHistory of hypersensitivity to megestrol acetate or any component of the formulation .
Known or suspected pregnancy .
WARNINGSMegestrol acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
For animal data on fetal effects , ( see PRECAUTIONS : Impairment of Fertility section ) .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking ( receiving ) this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant .
Megestrol acetate is not intended for prophylactic use to avoid weight loss .
( See also PRECAUTIONS : Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Impairment of Fertility section ) .
The glucocorticoid activity of megestrol acetate oral suspension has not been fully evaluated .
Clinical cases of new onset diabetes mellitus , exacerbation of pre - existing diabetes mellitus , and overt Cushing ’ s Syndrome have been reported in association with the chronic use of megestrol acetate .
In addition , clinical cases of adrenal insufficiency have been observed in patients receiving or being withdrawn from chronic megestrol acetate therapy in the stressed and non - stressed state .
Furthermore , adrenocorticotropin ( ACTH ) stimulation testing has revealed the frequent occurrence of asymptomatic pituitary - adrenal suppression in patients treated with chronic megestrol acetate therapy .
Therefore , the possibility of adrenal insufficiency should be considered in any patient receiving or being withdrawn from chronic Megace ® ES therapy who presents with symptoms and / or signs suggestive of hypoadrenalism ( e . g . , hypotension , nausea , vomiting , dizziness , or weakness ) in either the stressed or non - stressed state .
Laboratory evaluation for adrenal insufficiency and consideration of replacement or stress doses of a rapidly acting glucocorticoid are strongly recommended in such patients .
Failure to recognize inhibition of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis may result in death .
Finally , in patients who are receiving or being withdrawn from chronic Megace ® ES therapy , consideration should be given to the use of empiric therapy with stress doses of a rapidly acting glucocorticoid during stress or serious intercurrent illness ( e . g . , surgery , infection ) .
PRECAUTIONS GENERAL Therapy with Megace ® ES ( megestrol acetate ) oral suspension for weight loss should only be instituted after treatable causes of weight loss are sought and addressed .
These treatable causes include possible malignancies , systemic infections , gastrointestinal disorders affecting absorption , endocrine disease and renal or psychiatric diseases .
Effects on HIV viral replication have not been determined .
Use with caution in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease .
Use in DiabeticsExacerbation of pre - existing diabetes with increased insulin requirements have been reported in association with the use of megestrol acetate .
Information for PatientsPatients using Megace ® ES ( megestrol acetate ) should receive the following instructions : • This medication is to be used as directed by the physician .
• Megace ® ES ( 625 mg / 5 mL ) does not contain the same amount of megestrol acetate as Megace ® oral suspension or any of the other megestrol acetate oral suspensions .
Megace ® ES contains 625 mg of megestrol acetate per 5 mL whereas Megace ® oral suspension and other megestrol acetate oral suspensions contain 800 mg per 20 mL .
• The prescriber should inform the patient about the product differences to avoid overdosing or underdosing of megestrol acetate .
The recommended adult dosage of Megace ® ES is one teaspoon ( 5 mL ) once a day .
Please see table in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section .
• Report any adverse reaction experiences while taking this medication .
• Use contraception while taking this medication if you are a woman capable of becoming pregnant .
• Notify your physician if you become pregnant while taking this medication .
Drug InteractionsPharmacokinetic studies show that there are no significant alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters of zidovudine or rifabutin to warrant dosage adjustment when megestrol acetate is administered with these drugs .
A pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that coadministration of megestrol acetate and indinavir results in a significant decrease in the pharmacokinetic parameters ( ~ 36 % for C max and ~ 28 % for AUC ) of indinavir .
Administration of a higher dose of indinavir should be considered when coadministering with megestrol acetate .
The effects of indinavir , zidovudine or rifabutin on the pharmacokinetics of megestrol acetate were not studied .
Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of FertilityData on carcinogenesis were obtained from studies conducted in dogs , monkeys and rats treated with megestrol acetate at doses 53 . 2 , 26 . 6 and 1 . 3 times lower than the proposed dose ( 13 . 3 mg / kg / day ) for humans .
No males were used in the dog and monkey studies .
In female beagles , megestrol acetate ( 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 or 0 . 25 mg / kg / day ) administered for up to 7 years induced both benign and malignant tumors of the breast .
In female monkeys , no tumors were found following 10 years of treatment with 0 . 01 , 0 . 1 or 0 . 5 mg / kg / day megestrol acetate .
Pituitary tumors were observed in female rats treated with 3 . 9 or 10 mg / kg / day of megestrol acetate for 2 years .
The relationship of these tumors in rats and dogs to humans is unknown but should be considered in assessing the risk - to - benefit ratio when prescribing Megace ® ES ( megestrol acetate ) oral suspension and in surveillance of patients on therapy .
( See WARNINGS section ) .
MutagenesisNo mutagenesis data are currently available .
Impairment of FertilityPerinatal / postnatal ( segment III ) toxicity studies were performed in rats at doses ( 0 . 05 to 12 . 5 mg / kg ) less than that indicated for humans ( 13 . 3 mg / kg ) ; in these low dose studies , the reproductive capability of male offspring of megestrol acetate - treated females was impaired .
Similar results were obtained in dogs .
Pregnant rats treated with megestrol acetate showed a reduction in fetal weight and number of live births , and feminization of male fetuses .
No toxicity data are currently available on male reproduction ( spermatogenesis ) .
PregnancyPregnancy Category X . ( See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS : Impairment of Fertility sections ) .
No adequate animal teratology information is available at clinically relevant doses .
Nursing MothersBecause of the potential for adverse effects on the newborn , nursing should be discontinued if Megace ® ES ( megestrol acetate ) oral suspension is required .
Use in HIV Infected WomenAlthough megestrol acetate has been used extensively in women for the treatment of endometrial and breast cancers , its use in HIV infected women has been limited .
All 10 women in the clinical trials reported breakthrough bleeding .
Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric UseClinical studies of megestrol acetate oral suspension in the treatment of anorexia , cachexia , or an unexplained , significant weight loss in patients with AIDS did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
Megestrol acetate is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
ADVERSE REACTIONSClinical Adverse Events Adverse events which occurred in at least 5 % of patients in any arm of the two clinical efficacy trials and the open trial are listed below by treatment group .
All patients listed had at least one post baseline visit during the 12 study weeks .
