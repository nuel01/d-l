[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Minocycline hydrochloride tablets are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration .
Following a single dose of one 100 mg tablet of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 28 normal fasting adult volunteers , maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 3 hours ( average 1 . 71 hours ) and ranged from 491 . 71 to 1292 . 70 ng / mL ( average 758 . 29 ng / mL ) .
The serum half - life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11 . 38 to 24 . 31 hours ( average 17 . 03 hours ) .
When minocycline hydrochloride tablets were given concomitantly with a meal , which included dairy products , the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride tablets was slightly decreased ( 6 % ) .
The peak plasma concentrations were slightly decreased ( 12 % ) and delayed by 1 . 09 hours when administered with food , compared to dosing under fasting conditions .
In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms , the minocycline serum half - life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction , and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction .
The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers is one - half to one - third that of other tetracyclines .
Microbiology The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis .
The tetracyclines , including minocycline , have similar antimicrobial spectra of activity against a wide range of gram - positive and gram - negative organisms .
Cross - resistance of these organisms to tetracyclines is common .
Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section : AEROBIC GRAM - POSITIVE MICROORGANISMS Because many strains of the following gram - positive microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines , culture and susceptibility testing are especially recommended .
Tetracycline antibiotics should not be used for streptococcal diseases unless the organism has been demonstrated to be susceptible .
Tetracyclines are not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection .
Bacillus anthracis † Listeria monocytogenes † Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae AEROBIC GRAM - NEGATIVE MICROORGANISMS Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Calymmatobacterium granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Because many strains of the following groups of gram - negative microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines , culture and susceptibility tests are especially recommended .
Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae † Neisseria meningitidis † Shigella species “ OTHER ” MICROORGANISMS Actinomyces species † Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydia psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species † Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp .
fusiforme † Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum † Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue † Ureaplasma urealyticum † When penicillin is contraindicated , tetracyclines are alternative drugs in the treatment of infections caused by the cited microorganisms .
Susceptibility Tests Susceptibility testing should be performed with tetracycline since it predicts susceptibility to minocycline .
However , certain organisms ( e . g . , some staphylococci , and Acinetobacter ssp . )
may be more susceptible to minocycline and doxycycline than tetracycline .
Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) .
These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure .
Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1 , 3 ( broth or agar ) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline powder .
The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria : For testing aerobic gram - negative microorganisms ( Enterobacteriaceae ) , Acinetobacter ssp .
and Staphylococcus aureus .
MIC ( mcg / mL ) Interpretation ≤ 4 Susceptible ( S ) 8 Intermediate ( I ) ≥ 16 Resistant ( R ) For testing Haemophilus influenzaea and Streptococcus pneumoniaeb : MIC ( mcg / mL ) Interpretation ≤ 2 Susceptible ( S ) 4 Intermediate ( I ) ≥ 8 Resistant ( R ) a .
These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing with Haemophilus influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium . 1 b .
These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing using cation - adjusted Muller - Hinton broth with 2 - 5 % lysed horse blood . 1 For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeaec : MIC ( mcg / mL ) Interpretation ≤ 0 . 25 Susceptible ( S ) 0 . 5 - 1 Intermediate ( I ) ≥ 2 Resistant ( R ) c .
These interpretative standards are applicable only to agar dilution susceptibility testing using GC agar base and 1 % defined growth supplements . 1 A report of “ Susceptible ” indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable .
A report of “ Intermediate ” indicates that the result should be considered equivocal , and , if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative , clinically feasible drugs , the test should be repeated .
This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used .
This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation .
A report of “ Resistant ” indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable ; other therapy should be selected .
Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures .
Standard tetracycline powder should provide the following MIC values : Microorganism MIC ( mcg / mL ) Escherichia coli Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus aureus Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 25922 0 . 5 - 2 ATCC 29212 8 - 32 ATCC 29213 0 . 25 - 1 ATCC 49247 4 - 32 ATCC 49619 0 . 12 - 0 . 5 ATCC 49226 0 . 25 - 1 Diffusion techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
One such standardized procedure2 , 3 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations .
This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg tetracycline ( class disk ) or 30 mcg minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline .
Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single - disk susceptibility test with a 30 mcg tetracycline or minocycline disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria : For testing aerobic gram - negative microorganisms ( Enterobacteriaceae ) .
Acinetobacter ssp .
and Staphylococcus aureu : Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 19 Susceptible ( S ) 15 - 18 Intermediate ( I ) ≤ 14 Resistant ( R ) For testing Haemophilus influenzaed : Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 29 Susceptible ( S ) 26 - 28 Intermediate ( I ) ≤ 25 Resistant ( R ) d .
These zone diameter standards are applicable only to susceptibility testing with Haemophilus influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium and a 30 mcg tetracycline disk . 2 For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeaee : Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 38 Susceptible ( S ) 31 - 37 Intermediate ( I ) ≤ 30 Resistant ( R ) e .
These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using GC agar and 1 % growth supplements , and a 30 mcg tetracycline disk . 2 For testing Streptococcus pneumoniaef : Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 23 Susceptible ( S ) 19 - 22 Intermediate ( I ) ≤ 18 Resistant ( R ) f .
These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using Muller - Hinton agar adjusted with 5 % sheep blood and a 30 mcg tetracycline - class disk . 2 For testing Vibrio choleraeg : Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 19 Susceptible ( S ) 15 - 18 Intermediate ( I ) ≤ 14 Resistant ( R ) g .
These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing performed with a 30 mcg tetracycline - class disk . 2 Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques .
Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for tetracycline .
As with standardized dilution techniques , diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures .
For the diffusion technique , the 30 mcg tetracycline or minocycline disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains : Microorganism Zone Diameter Range ( mm ) Tetracycline Minocycline Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria gonorrhoeae Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 25922 ATCC 25923 ATCC 49247 ATCC 49226 ATCC 49619 18 - 25 24 - 30 14 - 22 30 - 42 27 - 31 19 - 25 25 - 30 — — — INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride tablets are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms : Rocky Mountain spotted fever , typhus fever and the typhus group , Q fever , rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae .

Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitides to eliminate the meningococci from the nasopharynx .
In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carrier , diagnostic laboratory procedures , including serotyping and susceptibility testing , should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment .
It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high .
Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection .
Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted , limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum .
To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of , minocycline hydrochloride tablets and other antibacterial drugs , minocycline hydrochloride tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines .
WARNINGS MINOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE TABLETS , LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINES - CLASS ANTIBIOTICS , CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN .
IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS , THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS .
THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT ( LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY , INFANCY , AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS ) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH ( YELLOW - GRAY - BROWN ) .
This adverse reaction is more common during long - term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short - term courses .
Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported .
TETRACYCLINE DRUGS , THEREFORE , SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED .
All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone - forming tissue .
A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg / kg every six hours .
This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued .
Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta , are found in fetal tissues , and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus ( often related to retardation of skeletal development ) .
Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy .
The anti - anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN .
While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function , in patients with significantly impaired function , higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia , hyperphosphatemia , and acidosis .
If renal impairment exists , even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity .
Under such conditions , lower than usual total doses are indicated , and if therapy is prolonged , serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable .
Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines .
This has been reported rarely with minocycline .
Central nervous system side effects including light headedness , dizziness , or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy .
Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy .
These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued .
PRECAUTIONS Minocycline Hydrochloride Tablets , 50 mg contains FD & C Yellow No . 5 ( Tartrazine ) which may cause allergic - type reactions ( including bronchial asthma ) in certain susceptible persons .
Although the overall incidence of FD & C Yellow No . 5 ( Tartrazine ) sensitivity in the general population is low , it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity .
General As with other antibiotic preparations , use of this drug may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms , including fungi .
If superinfection occurs , the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
Pseudotumor cerebri ( benign intracranial hypertension ) in adults has been associated with the use of tetracyclines .
The usual clinical manifestations are headaches and blurred vision .
Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants .
While both of these conditions and related symptoms usually resolve after discontinuation of the tetracycline , the possibility for permanent sequelae exists .
Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated .
Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria .
Information For Patients Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines .
Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs , and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema .
This reaction has been reported rarely with use of minocycline .
Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms ( see WARNINGS ) should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy .
Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective ( see Drug Interactions ) .
Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs , including minocycline hydrochloride tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When minocycline hydrochloride tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that , although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may : ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment , and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
Laboratory Tests In long - term therapy , periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems , including hematopoietic , renal , and hepatic studies should be performed .
All patients with gonorrhea should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of diagnosis .
Patients treated with minocycline should have a follow - up serologic test for syphilis after 3 months .
Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity , patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage .
Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin , it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline - class drugs in conjunction with penicillin .
Absorption of oral tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum , calcium or magnesium , and iron - containing preparations .
The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity .
Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective .
Drug Laboratory Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production .
Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs .
In addition , there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic , oxytetracycline ( i . e . , adrenal and pituitary tumors ) .
Likewise , although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted , positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays ( i . e . , mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells ) have been reported for related antibiotics ( tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline ) .
Segment I ( fertility and general reproduction ) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D . ( See WARNINGS ) .
Nonteratogenic Effects ( See WARNINGS ) .
Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown .
Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother ( see WARNINGS ) .
Pediatric Use ( See WARNINGS ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral minocycline ’ s virtually complete absorption , side effects to the lower bowel , particularly diarrhea , have been infrequent .
The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines .
