[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY CARNITOR ® ( levocarnitine ) is a naturally occurring substance required in mammalian energy metabolism .
It has been shown to facilitate long - chain fatty acid entry into cellular mitochondria , thereby delivering substrate for oxidation and subsequent energy production .
Fatty acids are utilized as an energy substrate in all tissues except the brain .
In skeletal and cardiac muscle , fatty acids are the main substrate for energy production .
Primary systemic carnitine deficiency is characterized by low concentrations of levocarnitine in plasma , RBC , and / or tissues .
It has not been possible to determine which symptoms are due to carnitine deficiency and which are due to an underlying organic acidemia , as symptoms of both abnormalities may be expected to improve with CARNITOR ® .
The literature reports that carnitine can promote the excretion of excess organic or fatty acids in patients with defects in fatty acid metabolism and / or specific organic acidopathies that bioaccumulate acylCoA esters . 1 - 6 Secondary carnitine deficiency can be a consequence of inborn errors of metabolism .
CARNITOR ® may alleviate the metabolic abnormalities of patients with inborn errors that result in accumulation of toxic organic acids .
Conditions for which this effect has been demonstrated are : glutaric aciduria II , methyl malonic aciduria , propionic acidemia , and medium chain fatty acylCoA dehydrogenase deficiency . 7 , 8 Autointoxication occurs in these patients due to the accumulation of acylCoA compounds that disrupt intermediary metabolism .
The subsequent hydrolysis of the acylCoA compound to its free acid results in acidosis which can be life - threatening .
Levocarnitine clears the acylCoA compound by formation of acylcarnitine , which is quickly excreted .
Carnitine deficiency is defined biochemically as abnormally low plasma concentrations of free carnitine , less than 20 µmol / L at one week post term and may be associated with low tissue and / or urine concentrations .
Further , this condition may be associated with a plasma concentration ratio of acylcarnitine / levocarnitine greater than 0 . 4 or abnormally elevated concentrations of acylcarnitine in the urine .
In premature infants and newborns , secondary deficiency is defined as plasma levocarnitine concentrations below age - related normal concentrations .
PHARMACOKINETICS In a relative bioavailability study in 15 healthy adult male volunteers , CARNITOR ® Tablets were found to be bio - equivalent to CARNITOR ® Oral Solution .
Following 4 days of dosing with 6 tablets of CARNITOR ® 330 mg b . i . d . or 2 g of CARNITOR ® oral solution b . i . d . , the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) was about 80 µmol / L and the time to maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) occurred at 3 . 3 hours .
The plasma concentration profiles of levocarnitine after a slow 3 minute intravenous bolus dose of 20 mg / kg of CARNITOR ® were described by a two - compartment model .
Following a single i . v . administration , approximately 76 % of the levocarnitine dose was excreted in the urine during the 0 - 24 h interval .
Using plasma concentrations uncorrected for endogenous levocarnitine , the mean distribution half life was 0 . 585 hours and the mean apparent terminal elimination half life was 17 . 4 hours .
The absolute bioavailability of levocarnitine from the two oral formulations of CARNITOR ® , calculated after correction for circulating endogenous plasma concentrations of levocarnitine , was 15 . 1 ± 5 . 3 % for CARNITOR ® Tablets and 15 . 9 ± 4 . 9 % for CARNITOR ® Oral Solution .
Total body clearance of levocarnitine ( Dose / AUC including endogenous baseline concentrations ) was a mean of 4 . 00 L / h .
Levocarnitine was not bound to plasma protein or albumin when tested at any concentration or with any species including the human . 9 METABOLISM AND EXCRETION In a pharmacokinetic study where five normal adult male volunteers received an oral dose of [ 3 H - methyl ] - L - carnitine following 15 days of a high carnitine diet and additional carnitine supplement , 58 to 65 % of the administered radioactive dose was recovered in the urine and feces in 5 to 11 days .
Maximum concentration of [ 3 H - methyl ] - L - carnitine in serum occurred from 2 . 0 to 4 . 5 hr after drug administration .
Major metabolites found were trimethylamine N - oxide , primarily in urine ( 8 % to 49 % of the administered dose ) and [ 3 H ] - γ - butyrobetaine , primarily in feces ( 0 . 44 % to 45 % of the administered dose ) .
Urinary excretion of levocarnitine was about 4 to 8 % of the dose .
Fecal excretion of total carnitine was less than 1 % of the administered dose . 10 After attainment of steady state following 4 days of oral administration of CARNITOR ® Tablets ( 1980 mg q12h ) or Oral Solution ( 2000 mg q12h ) to 15 healthy male volunteers , the mean urinary excretion of levocarnitine during a single dosing interval ( 12 h ) was about 9 % of the orally administered dose ( uncorrected for endogenous urinary excretion ) .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE CARNITOR ® ( levocarnitine ) is indicated in the treatment of primary systemic carnitine deficiency .
In the reported cases , the clinical presentation consisted of recurrent episodes of Reye - like encephalopathy , hypoketotic hypoglycemia , and / or cardiomyopathy .
Associated symptoms included hypotonia , muscle weakness and failure to thrive .
A diagnosis of primary carnitine deficiency requires that serum , red cell and / or tissue carnitine levels be low and that the patient does not have a primary defect in fatty acid or organic acid oxidation ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) .
In some patients , particularly those presenting with cardiomyopathy , carnitine supplementation rapidly alleviated signs and symptoms .
Treatment should include , in addition to carnitine , supportive and other therapy as indicated by the condition of the patient .
CARNITOR ® ( levocarnitine ) is also indicated for acute and chronic treatment of patients with an inborn error of metabolism which results in a secondary carnitine deficiency .
CONTRAINDICATIONS None known .
WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions , including rash , urticaria , and facial edema have been reported with oral CARNITOR ® .
Other serious hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , laryngeal edema , and bronchospasm have been reported following intravenous levocarnitine administration , mostly in patients with end stage renal disease undergoing dialysis .
Discontinue use of CARNITOR ® and instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction .
PRECAUTIONS General CARNITOR ® ( levocarnitine ) Oral Solution and CARNITOR ® SF ( levocarnitine ) Sugar - Free Oral Solution are for oral / internal use only .
Not for parenteral use .
Gastrointestinal reactions may result from a too rapid consumption of carnitine .
CARNITOR ® ( levocarnitine ) Oral Solution and CARNITOR ® SF ( levocarnitine ) Sugar - Free Oral Solution may be consumed alone , or dissolved in drinks or other liquid foods to reduce taste fatigue .
They should be consumed slowly and doses should be spaced evenly throughout the day to maximize tolerance .
The safety and efficacy of oral levocarnitine has not been evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency .
Chronic administration of high doses of oral levocarnitine in patients with severely compromised renal function or in ESRD patients on dialysis may result in accumulation of the potentially toxic metabolites , trimethylamine ( TMA ) and trimethylamine - N - oxide ( TMAO ) , since these metabolites are normally excreted in the urine .
Drug Interactions Reports of INR increase with the use of warfarin have been observed .
It is recommended that INR levels be monitored in patients on warfarin therapy after the initiation of treatment with levocarnitine or after dose adjustments .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Mutagenicity tests performed in Salmonella typhimurium , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Schizosaccharomyces pombe indicate that levocarnitine is not mutagenic .
No long - term animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of levocarnitine .
Pregnancy Reproductive studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 3 . 8 times the human dose on the basis of surface area and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to CARNITOR ® .
There are , however , no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers Levocarnitine supplementation in nursing mothers has not been specifically studied .
Studies in dairy cows indicate that the concentration of levocarnitine in milk is increased following exogenous administration of levocarnitine .
In nursing mothers receiving levocarnitine , any risks to the child of excess carnitine intake need to be weighed against the benefits of levocarnitine supplementation to the mother .
Consideration may be given to discontinuation of nursing or of levocarnitine treatment .
Pediatric Use See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of oral formulations of levocarnitine were identified in clinical trials or postmarketing reports .
Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to estimate their frequency , reliability , or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Gastrointestinal Reactions : Various mild gastrointestinal complaints have been reported during the long - term administration of oral L - or D , L - carnitine ; these include transient nausea and vomiting , abdominal cramps , and diarrhea .
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions with CARNITOR ® ( levocarnitine ) Oral Solution or CARNITOR ® SF ( levocarnitine ) Sugar - Free Oral Solution dissolved in liquids might be avoided by a slow consumption of the solution or by a greater dilution .
Decreasing the dosage often diminishes or eliminates drug - related patient body odor or gastrointestinal symptoms when present .
Tolerance should be monitored very closely during the first week of administration , and after any dosage increases .
Musculoskeletal Reactions : Mild myasthenia has been described only in uremic patients receiving D , L - carnitine .
Neurologic Reactions : Seizures have been reported to occur in patients with or without pre - existing seizure activity receiving either oral or intravenous levocarnitine .
In patients with pre - existing seizure activity , an increase in seizure frequency and / or severity has been reported .
Hypersensitivity Reactions : Rash , urticaria , and facial edema have been reported with oral CARNITOR ® ( see WARNINGS ) .
OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of toxicity from levocarnitine overdosage .
Levocarnitine is easily removed from plasma by dialysis .
The intravenous LD50 of levocarnitine in rats is 5 . 4 g / kg and the oral LD50 of levocarnitine in mice is 19 . 2 g / kg .
