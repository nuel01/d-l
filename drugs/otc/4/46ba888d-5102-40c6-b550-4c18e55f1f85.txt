DESCRIPTION Each reaction vial contains a sterile , nonpyrogenic , nonradioactive lyophilized mixture of 20 mg medronic acid , 1 mg ascorbic acid , 0 . 13 mg ( minimum ) stannous fluoride , SnF2 and 0 . 38 mg total tin , maximum ( as stannous fluoride , SnF2 ) .
The pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to 6 . 5 ( 6 . 3 to 6 . 7 ) prior to lyophilization .
The vial does not contain a preservative .
The contents of the vial are lyophilized and sealed under nitrogen at the time of manufacture .
The pH of the reconstituted product is 5 . 4 to 6 . 8 .
The structure of medronic acid is given below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The precise structure of technetium Tc 99 m medronate is unknown at this time .
When sterile , pyrogen - free sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection is added to the vial , the diagnostic agent technetium Tc 99 m medronate is formed for administration by intravenous injection .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS Technetium Tc 99 m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half - life of 6 . 02 hours . 1 The principal photon that is useful for detection and imaging studies is shown in Table 1 .
Table 11 Kocher , David C : Radioactive Decay Data Tables , DOE / TlC - 11026 , 108 , 1981 Principal Radiation Emission Data Radiation Mean % per Disintegration Mean Energy ( keV ) Gamma - 2 89 . 07 140 . 5 External Radiation The specific gamma ray constant for Tc 99 m is 0 . 78 R / hour - millicurie at 1 cm .
The first half - value layer is 0 . 017 cm lead ( Pb ) .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2 .
To facilitate control of the radiation exposure from millicurie amounts of this radionuclide , the use of a 0 . 25 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1 , 000 .

A minimum amount of uptake has been observed in soft - tissue organs , most notably the kidneys .
Clearance of radioactivity from the blood is quite rapid , with about 10 percent of the injected dose remaining at one hour , and less than 5 and 2 percent at two and four hours , respectively .
The rapid blood clearance ( T ½ : 38 to 75 minutes ) provides bone to non - osseous tissue ratios favoring early imaging .
Following intravenous administration of technetium Tc 99 m medronate , skeletal uptake occurs as a function of blood flow to bone and bone efficiency in extracting the complex .
Bone mineral crystals are generally considered to be hydroxyapatite , and the complex appears to have an affinity for the hydroxyapatite crystals in bone .
Deposition of radioactivity in bone is rapid and appears to be related to osteogenic activity as well as the aforementioned skeletal blood perfusion .
Skeletal uptake is bilaterally uniform , with larger concentrations in the axial structure and in the long bones .
Increased accumulation of radioactivity may be seen , generally , in any bone disease state in which there is increased osteogenesis or a localized increase in osseous blood perfusion ; consequently , bone imaging agents generally are not effective in detecting chronic bone diseases .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Technetium Tc 99 m medronate may be used as a bone imaging agent to delineate areas of altered osteogenesis .
CONTRAINDICATIONS None known .
WARNINGS This class of compounds is known to complex cations such as calcium .
Particular caution should be used with patients who have or who may be predisposed to hypocalcemia ( i . e . , alkalosis ) .
Preliminary reports indicate interference with brain scans using sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection which have been preceded by a bone scan using an agent containing stannous ions .
This interference may result in false - positive or false - negative brain scans .
It is recommended , where feasible , that brain scans precede bone imaging procedures .
PRECAUTIONS General The contents of the kit before preparation are not radioactive .
However , after the sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection is added , adequate shielding of the final preparation must be maintained .
Contents of the reaction vial are intended only for use in the preparation of technetium Tc 99 m medronate and are NOT to be administered directly to the patient .
Technetium Tc 99 m medronate as well as other radioactive drugs , must be handled with care .
Once sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m is added to the vial , appropriate safety measures should be used to minimize external radiation to clinical occupational personnel .
Care should also be taken to minimize radiation exposure to patients in a manner consistent with proper patient management .
To minimize the radiation dose to the bladder , the patient should be encouraged to drink fluids and to void immediately before the examination and as often thereafter as possible for the next four to six hours .
Technetium Tc 99 m medronate should be formulated within six ( 6 ) hours prior to clinical use .
Optimal imaging results are obtained one to four hours after administration .
Technetium Tc 99 m medronate injection should be discarded six hours after reconstitution .
The solution should not be used if cloudy .
The components of the kit are sterile and pyrogen - free .
It is essential to follow directions carefully and to adhere to strict aseptic procedures during preparation .
The technetium Tc 99 m labeling reactions involved in preparing the agent depend on maintaining the stannous ion in the reduced state .
Any oxidant present in the sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m supply may , thus , adversely affect the quality of the radiopharmaceutical .
Hence , sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m containing oxidants should not be employed .
Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential or whether technetium Tc 99 m medronate affects fertility in males or females .
Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with technetium Tc 99 m medronate .
It is also not known whether technetium Tc 99 m medronate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity .
Technetium Tc 99 m medronate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers Technetium Tc 99 m is excreted in human milk during lactation ; therefore , formula - feedings should be substituted for breast - feedings .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Several adverse reactions due to technetium Tc 99 m medronate have been reported .
These were usually hypersensitivity reactions characterized by itching , various skin rashes , hypotension , chills , nausea and vomiting .
There have also been rare cases of dizziness and asthenia associated with the use of technetium Tc 99 m medronate .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION After preparation with oxidant - free sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection the suggested dose range of technetium Tc 99 m medronate injection in the average patient ( 70 kg ) is 370 MBq to 740 MBq ( 10 mCi to 20 mCi ) given intravenously .
Imaging post injection is optimal at 1 to 4 hours .
The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
Shielding should be utilized when preparing the technetium Tc 99 m medronate injection .
Radiation Dosimetry The effective half - life was assumed to be the physical half - life for all calculated values .
