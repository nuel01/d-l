DOE / TIC - 11026 : 108 , 1981 External Radiation The specific gamma ray constant for Tc 99 m is 0 . 78 R / hr - millicurie at 1 cm .
The first half - value layer is 0 . 017 cm of lead ( Pb ) .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2 .
For example , the use of a 0 . 25 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1 , 000 .

It is also concentrated in the injured myocardium , primarily in areas of irreversibly damaged myocardial cells .
One to two hours after intravenous injection of Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection , an estimated 40 to 50 percent of the injected dose has been taken up by the skeleton , and approximately 0 . 01 to 0 . 02 percent per gram of acutely infarcted myocardium .
Within a period of one hour , 10 to 11 percent remains in the vascular system , declining to approximately 2 to 3 percent twenty - four hours post injection .
The average urinary excretion was observed to be about 40 percent of the administered dose after 24 hours .
The non - radioactive reconstituted Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection also has an affinity for red blood cells .
When administered 30 minutes prior to the intravenous administration of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection , approximately 76 percent of the injected activity remains in the blood pool providing excellent images of the cardiac chambers .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection is a bone imaging agent used to demonstrate areas of altered osteogenesis , and a cardiac imaging agent used as an adjunct in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction .
Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection is a blood pool imaging agent which may be used for gated blood pool imaging and for the detection of sites of gastrointestinal bleeding .
When reconstituted with sterile non - pyrogenic isotonic saline and administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to the intravenous administration of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection , approximately 76 % of the injected radioactivity remains in the blood pool .
CONTRAINDICATIONS None known .
WARNINGS As an adjunct in the diagnosis of confirmed myocardial infarction ( ECG and serum enzymes positive ) , the incidence of false negative images has been found to be 6 percent .
False negative images can also occur if made prior to 24 hours in the evolutionary phase of the infarct or after 6 days in the resolution phase .
In a limited study involving 22 patients in whom the ECG was positive and serum enzymes questionable or negative , but in whom the final diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was made , the incidence of false negative images was 23 percent .
The incidence of false positive images has been found to be 7 to 9 percent .
False positive images have also been reported following coronary by - pass graft surgery , in unstable angina pectoris , old myocardial infarcts and in cardiac contusions .
Preliminary reports indicate impairment of brain scans using Sodium Pertechnetate Tc99m Injection which have been preceded by a bone scan using an agent containing stannous ions .
The impairment may result in false positive or false negative brain scans .
It is recommended , where feasible , that brain scans precede bone imaging procedures .
Alternately , a brain imaging agent such as Technetium Tc 99 m Pentetate Injection may be employed .
PRECAUTIONS General The lyophilized contents of the Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection reaction vial are to be administered to the patient only as an intravenous solution ( see Procedures for Reconstitution ) .
Any Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m solution which contains an oxidizing agent is not suitable for use with Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection .
When reconstituted with Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m , Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection must be used within 6 hours .
Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection may also be reconstituted with sterile , non - pyrogenic isotonic saline containing no preservatives and injected intravenously prior to the administration of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection .
Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection contains no preservatives .
Vials are sealed under nitrogen : air or oxygen is harmful to the contents of the vials and the vials should not be vented .
The components of the Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection are supplied sterile and non - pyrogenic .
Aseptic procedures normally employed in making additions and withdrawals for sterile , non - pyrogenic containers should be used during addition of the Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection and the withdrawal of doses for patient administration .
Shielding should be utilized when preparing Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection .
Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection as well as other radioactive drugs must be handled with care , and appropriate safety measures should be used to minimize radiation exposure to the patients and clinical personnel consistent with proper patient management .
The solution should not be used if cloudy , discolored , or found to contain particulate matter .
Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides , and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides .
No special handling is required for the non - radioactive drug product .
Bone Imaging Both prior to and following Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection administration , if not contraindicated for the patient ’ s cardiac condition , patients should be encouraged to drink fluids .
Patients should void as often as possible after the Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection to minimize background interference and unnecessary radiation exposure from accumulation in the bladder .
Cardiac Imaging Patient ’ s cardiac condition should be stable before beginning the cardiac imaging procedure .
Interference from chest wall lesions such as breast tumors and healing rib fractures can be minimized by employing the three recommended projections .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
False - positive and false - negative myocardial scans may occur ; therefore , the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction depends on the overall assessment of laboratory and clinical findings .
Blood Pool Imaging The non - radioactive reconstituted agent should be injected by direct venipuncture .
Heparinized catheter systems should be avoided , as interference with red blood cell tagging will result .
Cardiac pool imaging should be initiated 15 to 30 minutes after the administration of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection .
The imaging of gastrointestinal bleeding is dependent on such factors as the region of imaging , rate and volume of the bleed , efficacy of the labeling of the red blood cells and timeliness of imaging .
Due to these factors , images should be taken sequentially over a period of time until a positive image is obtained or clinical conditions warrant the discontinuance of the procedure .
The period of time for collecting the images may range up to 36 hours .
Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection and the non - radioactive reconstituted Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection should be formulated within six ( 6 ) hours prior to clinical use .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential or whether Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection affects fertility in males or females .
Mutagenesis studies have not been conducted .
Pregnancy Animal reproduction and teratogenicity studies have not been conducted with Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection .
It is also not known whether Technetium Tc 99 Pyrophosphate Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity .
Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Ideally , examinations using radiopharmaceuticals , especially those elective in nature , to a woman of childbearing capability should be performed during the first few ( approximately 10 ) days following the onset of menses .
Nursing mothers Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection is excreted in human milk during lactation , therefore , formula feeding should be substituted for breast feeding .
Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric use Clinical studies of the Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Pyrophosphate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Some hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with pyrophosphate use .
