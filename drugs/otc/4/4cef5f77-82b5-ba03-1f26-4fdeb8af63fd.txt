c Percent of patients receiving transfusions .
Transfusions are not CTC – graded events .
Blood transfusions included both packed red blood cells and whole blood .
Hematopoietic growth factors were administered more frequently in the gemcitabine for injection - containing arm : granulocyte growth factors ( 23 . 6 % and 10 . 1 % ) and erythropoietic agents ( 7 . 3 % and 3 . 9 % ) .
The following clinically relevant , Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred more frequently in the gemcitabine for injection plus carboplatin arm : dyspnea ( 3 . 4 % versus 2 . 9 % ) , febrile neutropenia ( 1 . 1 % versus 0 ) , hemorrhagic event ( 2 . 3 % versus 1 . 1 % ) , motor neuropathy ( 1 . 1 % versus 0 . 6 % ) , and rash / desquamation ( 0 . 6 % versus 0 ) .
6 . 2 Post - Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of gemcitabine for injection .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiovascular — Congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , Arrhythmias , supraventricular arrhythmias .
Vascular Disorders — Peripheral vasculitis , gangrene , and capillary leak syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] Skin — Cellulitis , severe skin reactions , including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions Hepatic — Hepatic failure , hepatic veno - occlusive disease Pulmonary — Interstitial pneumonitis , pulmonary fibrosis , pulmonary edema , and adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) Nervous System — Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction studies have been conducted .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D . [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Risk Summary Gemcitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Based on its mechanism of action , gemcitabine for injection is expected to result in adverse reproductive effects .
Gemcitabine was teratogenic , embryotoxic , and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits .
If gemcitabine for injection is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking gemcitabine for injection , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus .
Animal Data Gemcitabine is embryotoxic causing fetal malformations ( cleft palate , incomplete ossification ) at doses of 1 . 5 mg / kg / day in mice ( approximately 0 . 005 times the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Gemcitabine is fetotoxic causing fetal malformations ( fused pulmonary artery , absence of gall bladder ) at doses of 0 . 1 mg / kg / day in rabbits ( about 0 . 002 times the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Embryotoxicity was characterized by decreased fetal viability , reduced live litter sizes , and developmental delays .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] 8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Gemcitabine for injection , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of gemcitabine for injection have not been established in pediatric patients .
The safety and pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine were evaluated in a trial in pediatric patients with refractory leukemia .
The maximum tolerated dose was 10 mg / m2 / min for 360 minutes three times weekly followed by a one - week rest period .
The safety and activity of gemcitabine for injection were evaluated in a trial of pediatric patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( 22 patients ) and acute myelogenous leukemia ( 10 patients ) at a dose of 10 mg / m2 / min administered over 360 minutes three times weekly followed by a one - week rest period .
Toxicities observed included bone marrow suppression , febrile neutropenia , elevation of serum transaminases , nausea , and rash / desquamation .
No meaningful clinical activity was observed in this trial .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies of gemcitabine for injection , enrolling 979 patients with various cancers who received gemcitabine for injection as a single agent , no overall differences in safety were observed between patients aged 65 and older and younger patients , with the exception of a higher rate of Grade 3 - 4 thrombocytopenia in older patients as compared to younger patients .
In a randomized trial in women with ovarian cancer , 175 women received gemcitabine for injection plus carboplatin , of which 29 % were age 65 years or older .
Similar effectiveness was observed between older and younger women .
There was significantly higher Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia in women 65 years of age or older .
Gemcitabine for injection clearance is affected by age , however there are no recommended dose adjustments based on patients ’ age [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No clinical studies have been conducted with gemcitabine in patients with decreased renal function .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies have been conducted with gemcitabine in patients with decreased hepatic function .
8 . 8 Gender Gemcitabine for injection clearance is affected by gender .
[ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In single - agent studies of gemcitabine for injection women , especially older women , were more likely not to proceed to a subsequent cycle and to experience Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia .
10 OVERDOSAGE Myelosuppression , paresthesias , and severe rash were the principal toxicities seen when a single dose as high as 5700 mg / m2 was administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks to several patients in a dose - escalation study .
11 DESCRIPTION Gemcitabine for injection , USP is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that exhibits antitumor activity .
Gemcitabine HCl USP is 2 ´ - deoxy - 2 ´ , 2 ´ - difluorocytidine monohydrochloride ( β - isomer ) .
The structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular formula for gemcitabine HCl is C9H11F2N3O4 • HCl .
It has a molecular weight of 299 . 66 .
Gemcitabine HCl USP is a white to off - white solid .
It is soluble in water , slightly soluble in methanol , and practically insoluble in ethanol and polar organic solvents .
Gemcitabine for Injection is supplied in a sterile form for intravenous use only .
Vials of gemcitabine for injection , USP contain either 200 mg or 1 g of gemcitabine HCl USP ( expressed as free base ) formulated with mannitol ( 200 mg or 1 g , respectively ) and sodium acetate trihydrate ( 20 . 73 mg or 103 . 5 mg ) , or sodium acetate ( 12 . 5 mg or 62 . 5 mg ) , respectively as a sterile lyophilized powder .
Hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Gemcitabine kills cells undergoing DNA synthesis and blocks the progression of cells through the G1 / S - phase boundary .
Gemcitabine is metabolized by nucleoside kinases to diphosphate ( dFdCDP ) and triphosphate ( dFdCTP ) nucleosides .
Gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase , an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA synthesis , resulting in reductions in deoxynucleotide concentrations , including dCTP .
Gemcitabine triphosphate competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA .
The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP by the action of the diphosphate enhances the incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA ( self - potentiation ) .
After the gemcitabine nucleotide is incorporated into DNA , only one additional nucleotide is added to the growing DNA strands , which eventually results in the initiation of apoptotic cell death .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution The pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine were examined in 353 patients , with various solid tumors .
Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using data from patients treated for varying durations of therapy given weekly with periodic rest weeks and using both short infusions ( < 70 minutes ) and long infusions ( 70 to 285 minutes ) .
The total gemcitabine for injection dose varied from 500 to 3600 mg / m2 .
The volume of distribution was increased with infusion length .
Volume of distribution of gemcitabine was 50 L / m2 following infusions lasting < 70 minutes .
For long infusions , the volume of distribution rose to 370 L / m2 .
Metabolism Gemcitabine disposition was studied in 5 patients who received a single 1000 mg / m2 / 30 minute infusion of radiolabeled drug .
Within one ( 1 ) week , 92 % to 98 % of the dose was recovered , almost entirely in the urine .
Gemcitabine ( < 10 % ) and the inactive uracil metabolite , 2 ´ - deoxy - 2 ´ , 2 ´ - difluorouridine ( dFdU ) , accounted for 99 % of the excreted dose .
The metabolite dFdU is also found in plasma .
The active metabolite , gemcitabine triphosphate , can be extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
The half - life of the terminal phase for gemcitabine triphosphate from mononuclear cells ranges from 1 . 7 to 19 . 4 hours .
Elimination Clearance of gemcitabine was affected by age and gender .
The lower clearance in women and the elderly results in higher concentrations of gemcitabine for any given dose .
Differences in either clearance or volume of distribution based on patient characteristics or the duration of infusion result in changes in half - life and plasma concentrations .
Table 10 shows plasma clearance and half - life of gemcitabine following short infusions for typical patients by age and gender .
Table 10 : Gemcitabine Clearance and Half – Life for the “ Typical ” Patient Age Clearance Men ( L / hr / m2 ) Clearance Women ( L / hr / m2 ) Half – Lifea Men ( min ) Half – Lifea Women ( min ) 29 92 . 2 69 . 4 42 49 45 75 . 7 57 48 57 65 55 . 1 41 . 5 61 73 79 40 . 7 30 . 7 79 94 aHalf – life for patients receiving < 70 minute infusion .
Gemcitabine half - life for short infusions ranged from 42 to 94 minutes , and the value for long infusions varied from 245 to 638 minutes , depending on age and gender , reflecting a greatly increased volume of distribution with longer infusions .
Drug Interactions When gemcitabine for injection ( 1250 mg / m2 on Days 1 and 8 ) and cisplatin ( 75 mg / m2 on Day 1 ) were administered in NSCLC patients , the clearance of gemcitabine on Day 1 was 128 L / hr / m2 and on Day 8 was 107 L / hr / m2 .
Analysis of data from metastatic breast cancer patients shows that , on average , gemcitabine for injection has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics ( clearance and half - life ) of paclitaxel and paclitaxel has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine .
Data from NSCLC patients demonstrate that gemcitabine for injection and carboplatin given in combination does not alter the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine or carboplatin compared to administration of either single - agent .
However , due to wide confidence intervals and small sample size , interpatient variability may be observed .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment Of Fertility Long - term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of gemcitabine for injection have not been conducted .
Gemcitabine was mutagenic in an in vitro mouse lymphoma ( L5178Y ) assay and was clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Gemcitabine IP doses of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( about 1 / 700 the human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) in male mice had an effect on fertility with moderate to severe hypospermatogenesis , decreased fertility , and decreased implantations .
In female mice , fertility was not affected but maternal toxicities were observed at 1 . 5 mg / kg / day administered intravenously ( about 1 / 200 the human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) and fetotoxicity or embryolethality was observed at 0 . 25 mg / kg / day administered intravenously ( about 1 / 1300 the human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Ovarian Cancer The safety and efficacy of gemcitabine for injection was studied in a randomized trial of 356 women with advanced ovarian cancer that had relapsed at least 6 months after first - line platinum - based therapy .
Patients were randomized to receive either gemcitabine for injection 1000 mg / m2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 - day cycle and carboplatin AUC 4 administered after gemcitabine for injection infusion on Day 1 of each cycle ( n = 178 ) or to carboplatin AUC 5 administered on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle ( n = 178 ) .
The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression free survival ( PFS ) .
Patient characteristics are shown in Table 11 .
The addition of gemcitabine for injection to carboplatin resulted in statistically significant improvements in PFS and overall response rate as shown in Table 12 and Figure 1 .
Approximately 75 % of patients in each arm received additional chemotherapy for disease progression ; 13 of 120 patients in the carboplatin alone arm received gemcitabine for injection for treatment of disease progression .
There was no significant difference in overall survival between the treatment arms .

28 - Day Schedule A multinational , randomized trial compared gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin to cisplatin alone in the treatment of patients with inoperable Stage IIIA , IIIB , or IV NSCLC who had not received prior chemotherapy .
Patients were randomized to receive gemcitabine for injection 1000 mg / m2 on Days 1 , 8 , and 15 of a 28 - day cycle with cisplatin 100 mg / m2 administered on Day 1 of each cycle or to receive cisplatin 100 mg / m2 on Day 1 of each 28 - day cycle .
The primary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival .
A total of 522 patients were enrolled at clinical centers in Europe , the US , and Canada .
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics ( shown in Table 13 ) were similar between arms with the exception of histologic subtype of NSCLC , with 48 % of patients on the cisplatin arm and 37 % of patients on the gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin arm having adenocarcinoma .
Efficacy results are presented in Table 13 and Figure 3 for overall survival .
21 - Day Schedule A randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , multicenter trial was conducted in 135 patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC .
Patients were randomized to receive gemcitabine for injection 1250 mg / m2 on Days 1 and 8 , and cisplatin 100 mg / m2 on Day 1 of a 21 - day cycle or to receive etoposide 100 mg / m2 intravenously on Days 1 , 2 , and 3 and cisplatin 100 mg / m2 on Day 1 of a 21 - day cycle .
There was no significant difference in survival between the two treatment arms ( Log rank p = 0 . 18 , two - sided ) .
The median survival was 8 . 7 months for the gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin arm versus 7 months for the etoposide plus cisplatin arm .
Median time to disease progression for the gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin arm was 5 months compared to 4 . 1 months on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm ( Log rank p = 0 . 015 , two - sided ) .

14 . 4 Pancreatic Cancer The safety and efficacy of gemcitabine for injection was evaluated in two trials , a randomized , single - blind , two - arm , active - controlled trial conducted in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who had received no prior chemotherapy and in a single - arm , open - label , multicenter trial conducted in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with 5 - FU or a 5 - FU - containing regimen .
The first trial randomized patients to receive gemcitabine for injection 1000 mg / m2 intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks followed by a one - week rest , then once weekly dosing for 3 consecutive weeks every 28 - days in subsequent cycles ( n = 63 ) or to 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) 600 mg / m2 intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly ( n = 63 ) .
In the second trial , all patients received gemcitabine for injection 1000 mg / m2 intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks followed by a one - week rest , then once weekly dosing for 3 consecutive weeks every 28 - days in subsequent cycles .
The primary efficacy outcome measure in both trials was " clinical benefit response " .
A patient was considered to have had a clinical benefit response if either occurred : The patient achieved a ≥ 50 % reduction in pain intensity ( Memorial Pain Assessment Card ) or analgesic consumption , or a 20 - point or greater improvement in performance status ( Karnofsky Performance Status ) for a period of at least 4 consecutive weeks , without showing any sustained worsening in any of the other parameters .
Sustained worsening was defined as 4 consecutive weeks with either any increase in pain intensity or analgesic consumption or a 20 - point decrease in performance status occurring during the first 12 weeks of therapy .
OR The patient was stable on all of the aforementioned parameters , and showed a marked , sustained weight gain ( ≥ 7 % increase maintained for ≥ 4 weeks ) not due to fluid accumulation .
The randomized trial enrolled 126 patients across 17 sites in the US and Canada .
The demographic and entry characteristics were similar between the arms ( Table 15 ) .
The efficacy outcome results are shown in Table 15 and for overall survival in Figure 4 .
Patients treated with gemcitabine for injection had statistically significant increases in clinical benefit response , survival , and time to disease progression compared to those randomized to receive 5 - FU .
No confirmed objective tumor responses were observed in either treatment arm .
