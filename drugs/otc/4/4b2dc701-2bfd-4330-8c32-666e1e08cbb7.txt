4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalexin or other members of the cephalosporin class of antibacterial drugs .
( 4 ) Cephalexin capsules are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalexin or other members of the cephalosporin class of antibacterial drugs .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Serious hypersensitivity ( anaphylactic ) reactions : Prior to use , inquire regarding history of hypersensitivity to beta - lactam antibacterial drugs .
Discontinue the drug if signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction occur and institute supportive measures .
( 5 . 1 ) • Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) : Evaluate if diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 2 ) • Direct Coombs ' Test Seroconversion : If anemia develops during or after cephalexin therapy , evaluate for drug - induced hemolytic anemia .
( 5 . 3 ) • Seizure Potential : Use lower dose in patients with renal impairment .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Allergic reactions in the form of rash , urticaria , angioedema , anaphylaxis , erythema multiforme , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with the use of cephalexin .
Before therapy with cephalexin capsules is instituted , inquire whether the patient has a history of hypersensitivity reactions to cephalexin , cephalosporins , penicillins , or other drugs .
Cross - hypersensitivity among beta - lactam antibacterial drugs may occur in up to 10 % of patients with a history of penicillin allergy .
If an allergic reaction to cephalexin occurs , discontinue the drug and institute appropriate treatment .
5 . 2 Clostridium difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including cephalexin , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B , which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin - producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 3 Direct Coombs ’ Test Seroconversion Positive direct Coombs ' tests have been reported during treatment with the cephalosporin antibacterial drugs including cephalexin .
Acute intravascular hemolysis induced by cephalexin therapy has been reported .
If anemia develops during or after cephalexin therapy , perform a diagnostic work - up for drug - induced hemolytic anemia , discontinue cephalexin and institute appropriate therapy .
5 . 4 Seizure Potential Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures , particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced .
If seizures occur , discontinue cephalexin .
Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated .
5 . 5 Prolonged Prothrombin Time Cephalosporins may be associated with prolonged prothrombin time .
Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment , or poor nutritional state , as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antibacterial therapy , and patients receiving anticoagulant therapy .
Monitor prothrombin time in patients at risk and manage as indicated .
5 . 6 Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria Prescribing cephalexin capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
Prolonged use of cephalexin may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms .
Careful observation of the patient is essential .
If superinfection occurs during therapy , appropriate measures should be taken .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions associated with cephalexin include diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , dyspepsia and abdominal pain .

As with penicillins and other cephalosporins , transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported .
Other reactions have included hypersensitivity reactions , genital and anal pruritus , genital candidiasis , vaginitis and vaginal discharge , dizziness , fatigue , headache , agitation , confusion , hallucinations , arthralgia , arthritis , and joint disorder .
Reversible interstitial nephritis has been reported .
Eosinophilia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , hemolytic anemia , and slight elevations in aspartate transaminase ( AST ) and alanine transaminase ( ALT ) have been reported .
In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with cephalexin , the following adverse reactions and other altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin class antibacterial drugs : Other Adverse Reactions Fever , colitis , aplastic anemia , hemorrhage , renal dysfunction , and toxic nephropathy .
Altered Laboratory Tests Prolonged prothrombin time , increased blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , increased creatinine , elevated alkaline phosphatase , elevated bilirubin , elevated lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , pancytopenia , leukopenia , and agranulocytosis .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Metformin : increased metformin concentrations .
Monitor for hypoglycemia .
( 7 . 1 ) • Probenecid - The renal excretion of cephalexin is inhibited by probenecid .
Co - administration of probenecid with cephalexin is not recommended .
( 7 . 2 ) • Administration of cephalexin may result in a false - positive reaction glucose in the urine .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Metformin Administration of cephalexin with metformin results in increased plasma metformin concentrations and decreased renal clearance of metformin .
Careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin is recommended in patients concomitantly taking cephalexin and metformin [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ] .
7 . 2 Probenecid The renal excretion of cephalexin is inhibited by probenecid .
Co - administration of probenecid with cephalexin capsules is not recommended .
7 . 3 Interaction with Laboratory or Diagnostic Testing A false - positive reaction may occur when testing for the presence of glucose in the urine using Benedict ' s solution or Fehling ' s solution .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Renal Impairment : Monitor patients longer for toxicity and drug interactions due to delayed clearance .
( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published epidemiologic studies and pharmacovigilance case reports over several decades with cephalosporin use , including cephalexin use in pregnant women have not established drug - associated risks of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ) .
Animal reproduction studies with mice and rats using oral doses of cephalexin that are 0 . 6 - and 1 . 2 - times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) based on body surface area during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data : While available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk , published data from epidemiologic studies and postmarketing case reports over several decades have not identified a consistent association with cephalosporin use , including cephalexin , during pregnancy , and major birth defects , miscarriage , or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Available studies have methodologic limitations , including small sample size , retrospective data collection , and inconsistent comparator groups .
Animal Data : In animal reproduction studies , pregnant mice and rats administered oral cephalexin doses of 250 or 500 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 6 and 1 . 2 times the MRHD ) based on body surface area , respectively during the period of organogenesis showed no adverse effects on embryofetal development .
In a pre - and post - natal developmental toxicity study , pregnant rats that received oral doses of 250 or 500 mg / kg / day of cephalexin from Day 15 of pregnancy to litter Day 21 showed no adverse effects on parturition , litter size , or growth of offspring .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from a published clinical lactation study reports that cephalexin is present in human milk .
The Relative Infant Dose ( RID ) is considered to be < 1 % of the maternal weight adjusted dose .
There are no data on the effects of cephalexin on the breastfed child or on milk production .
The development of health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for cephalexin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from cephalexin or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of cephalexin capsules in pediatric patients was established in clinical trials for the dosages described in the dosage and administration section [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 2 ) ] 8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 701 subjects in 3 published clinical studies of cephalexin , 433 ( 62 % ) were 65 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
This drug is substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Cephalexin capsules should be administered with careful monitoring in the presence of renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min , with or without dialysis ) .
Under such conditions , careful clinical observation and laboratory studies renal function monitoring should be conducted because safe dosage may be lower than that usually recommended [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Monitor patients longer for toxicity and drug interactions due to delayed clearance .
10 OVERDOSAGE Symptoms of oral overdose may include nausea , vomiting , epigastric distress , diarrhea , and hematuria .
In the event of an overdose , institute general supportive measures .
Forced diuresis , peritoneal dialysis , hemodialysis , or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for an overdose of cephalexin .

16 HOW SUPPLIED / STORAGE AND HANDLING Product : 50090 - 3111 NDC : 50090 - 3111 - 1 12 CAPSULE in a BOTTLE 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Allergic Reactions Advise patients that allergic reactions , including serious allergic reactions , could occur and that serious reactions require immediate treatment .
Ask the patient about any previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalexin capsules , other beta - lactams ( including cephalosporins ) or other allergens ( 5 . 1 ) Diarrhea Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs and usually resolves when the drug is discontinued .
Sometimes , frequent watery or bloody diarrhea may occur and may be a sign of a more serious intestinal infection .
If severe watery or bloody diarrhea develops , advise patients to contact their healthcare provider .
Antibacterial Resistance Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including cephalexin capsules , should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When cephalexin capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cephalexin capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future Manufactured for : Lupin Pharmaceuticals , Inc .
