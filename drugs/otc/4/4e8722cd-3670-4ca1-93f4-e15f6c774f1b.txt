d . Using a single - dose syringe fitted with a sterile needle ( size 21 G to 23 G ) and protective shielding , aseptically withdraw the prepared gallium Ga 68 gozetotide injection .
e . Verify the total radioactivity in the syringe with a dose calibrator immediately before and after gallium Ga 68 gozetotide injection administration to the patient .
The dose calibrator must be calibrated with NIST traceable standards .
f . After injection of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide , administer an intravenous flush of sterile 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP to ensure full delivery of the dose .
g . Dispose of any unused gallium Ga 68 gozetotide injection in a safe manner in compliance with applicable regulations .
h . If clinically necessary , a diuretic expected to act within the uptake time period may be administered at the time of radiotracer injection to potentially decrease artifact from radiotracer accumulation in the urinary bladder and ureters .
2 . 7 Image Acquisition Begin PET scanning 50 minutes to 100 minutes after the intravenous administration of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide injection .
Patients should void immediately prior to image acquisition and image acquisition should begin at the mid - thighs and proceed cranially to the skull base or skull vertex .
Adapt imaging technique according to the equipment used and patient characteristics in order to obtain the best image quality possible .
2 . 8 Image Interpretation Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide binds to PSMA .
Based on the intensity of the signals , PET images obtained using gallium Ga 68 gozetotide injection indicate the presence of PSMA in tissues .
Imaging Prior to Initial Definitive or Suspected Recurrence Therapy Lesions should be considered suspicious if uptake is greater than physiologic uptake in that tissue or greater than adjacent background if no physiologic uptake is expected .
Tumors that do not bear PSMA will not be visualized .
Increased uptake in tumors is not specific for prostate cancer [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Imaging to Select Patients for Lutetium Lu 177 Vipivotide Tetraxetan Therapy For patient selection , interpret LOCAMETZ PET in conjunction with patients ’ clinical history and imaging from other modalities , including diagnostic anatomical imaging in clinically relevant regions , such as chest , abdomen , and pelvis .
On LOCAMETZ PET images , compare uptake of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide at sites of suspected prostate cancer ( lesions ) with uptake in normal liver .
Lesions should be considered positive if gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake is greater than normal liver and negative if gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake is less than or equal to normal liver .
Patients should be considered eligible for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan therapy if at least one tumor lesion is positive and all lesions on anatomical imaging larger in short axis than size criteria are also positive [ size criteria : organs ≥ 1 cm , lymph nodes ≥ 2 . 5 cm , bones ( soft tissue component ) ≥ 1 cm ] .
Patients should be considered ineligible for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan therapy if all lesions are negative or any one lesion larger than size criteria is negative .
The interpretation of LOCAMETZ PET may differ depending on imaging readers [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
For therapeutic information , refer to the prescribing information for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan .
2 . 9 Radiation Dosimetry Estimated radiation absorbed doses per injected activity for organs and tissues of 13 adult male patients with an early stage of disease following an intravenous bolus of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide injection are shown in Table 2 .
The effective radiation dose resulting from the administration of 259 MBq ( 7 mCi ) is 4 . 4 mSv .
The radiation doses for this administered dose to the critical organs , which are the kidneys , urinary bladder , and spleen , are 96 . 2 mGy , 25 . 4 mGy , and 16 . 8 mGy , respectively .
These radiation doses are for gallium Ga 68 gozetotide injection alone .
If CT or a transmission source are used for attenuation correction , the radiation dose will increase by an amount that varies by technique .

( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None .
None .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Risk for Misinterpretation : Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake may occur in other tumor types and in non - malignant processes .
Interpretation of LOCAMETZ PET imaging with histopathology and / or other diagnostic procedures is recommended .
( 5 . 1 ) • Radiation Risk : Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide contributes to a patient ’ s overall long - term cumulative radiation exposure .
Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Risk for Misinterpretation Image interpretation errors can occur with LOCAMETZ PET .
Negative imaging does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer and a positive imaging does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer .
Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer as well as non - malignant processes , such as Paget ’ s disease , fibrous dysplasia , and osteophytosis .
Clinical correlation , which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site , is recommended .
Imaging Prior to Initial Definitive or Suspected Recurrence Therapy The performance of LOCAMETZ for imaging of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels and by site of disease .
The performance of LOCAMETZ for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems to be affected by Gleason score [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 , 14 . 2 ) ] .
Imaging to Select Patients for Lutetium Lu 177 Vipivotide Tetraxetan Therapy The interpretation of LOCAMETZ PET may differ depending on imaging readers [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 8 ) ] .
LOCAMETZ PET interpretations to select patients for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan therapy may be more consistent when judging gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake in any one tumor lesion compared to judging uptake for all lesions larger than size criteria [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Multidisciplinary consultation to select patients for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan therapy is recommended , particularly for LOCAMETZ imaging that a single reader finds borderline or difficult to interpret , or when patient eligibility hinges only on judgment of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake for all lesions larger than size criteria .
5 . 2 Radiation Risk Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide contributes to the patient ’ s overall long - term cumulative radiation exposure .
Long - term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer .
Ensure safe handling to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and health care workers .
Advise patients to be well hydrated prior to gallium Ga 68 gozetotide injection administration and to void immediately prior to and frequently during the first hours after image acquisition to reduce radiation exposure [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 3 ) ] .

8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use The efficacy of LOCAMETZ in geriatric patients with prostate cancer is based on data from three prospective studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Of the total number of subjects in the PSMA - PreRP and PSMA - BCR studies , 691 of 960 ( 72 % ) patients were 65 years of age and older while 195 ( 20 % ) were 75 years of age and older .
Of the total number of subjects in the VISION study , 752 of 1003 ( 75 % ) patients were 65 years of age and older while 284 ( 28 % ) were 75 years of age and older .
The efficacy and safety profiles of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide appeared similar in younger adult and geriatric patients with prostate cancer and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of an overdose of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide , reduce the radiation absorbed dose to the patient where possible by increasing the elimination of the radioactivity from the body by hydration and frequent bladder voiding .
A diuretic might also be considered .
If possible , an estimate of the effective radiation dose exposure to the patient should be made .

14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Imaging Prior to Initial Definitive Therapy The efficacy of LOCAMETZ for PET of PSMA - positive lesions in men with prostate cancer with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy has been established based on a study of another formulation of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide .
Below is a display of the results of the prospective , open label study PSMA - PreRP ( NCT03368547 and NCT02919111 ) .
PSMA - PreRP This two - center study enrolled 325 patients with biopsy - proven prostate cancer who were considered candidates for prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection .
All enrolled patients met at least one of the following criteria : serum PSA of at least 10 ng / mL , tumor stage cT2b or greater , or Gleason score greater than 6 .
Each patient received a single gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET / CT or PET / MR from mid - thigh to skull base .
A total of 123 patients ( 38 % ) proceeded to standard - of - care prostatectomy and template pelvic lymph node dissection and had sufficient histopathology data for evaluation ( evaluable patients ) .
Three members of a pool of six central readers independently interpreted each PET scan for the presence of abnormal gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake in pelvic lymph nodes located in the common iliac , external iliac , internal iliac , and obturator subregions bilaterally as well as in any other pelvic location .
The readers were blinded to all clinical information except for the history of prostate cancer prior to definitive treatment .
Extrapelvic sites and the prostate gland itself were not analyzed in this study .
For each patient , gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET results and reference standard histopathology obtained from dissected pelvic lymph nodes were compared by region ( left hemipelvis , right hemipelvis , and other ) .
For the 123 evaluable patients , the mean age was 65 years ( range , 45 to 76 years ) , and 89 % were white .
The median serum PSA was 11 . 8 ng / mL .
The summed Gleason score was 7 for 44 % , 8 for 20 % , and 9 for 31 % of the patients , with the remainder of the patients having Gleason scores of 6 or 10 .
Table 7 compares majority PET reads to pelvic lymph node histopathology results at the patient - level with region matching , such that at least one true positive region defines a true positive patient .
As shown , approximately 24 % of subjects studied were found to have pelvic nodal metastases based on histopathology ( 95 % CI : 17 , 32 ) .

In an exploratory subgroup analysis based on summed Gleason score , there was a numerical trend toward more true positives in patients with Gleason score of 8 or higher compared to those with Gleason score of 7 or lower .
An exploratory analysis was performed to estimate the sensitivity and specificity for pelvic nodal metastasis detection in all scanned patients , including the patients who were lacking histopathology reference standard .
An imputation method was used based on patient - specific factors .
This exploratory analysis resulted in an imputed sensitivity of 47 % , with a 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ranging from 38 % to 55 % , and an imputed specificity of 74 % , with a 95 % CI ranging from 68 % to 80 % for all patients imaged with gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET .
14 . 2 Imaging Prior to Suspected Recurrence Therapy The efficacy of LOCAMETZ for PET of PSMA - positive lesions in men with prostate cancer with suspected recurrence based on elevated serum PSA level has been established based on studies of another formulation of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide .
Below is a display of the result of the prospective , open label study PSMA - BCR ( NCT02940262 and NCT02918357 ) .
PSMA - BCR This two - center study enrolled 635 patients with biochemical evidence of recurrent prostate cancer after definitive therapy , defined by serum PSA of > 0 . 2 ng / mL more than 6 weeks after prostatectomy or by an increase in serum PSA of at least 2 ng / mL above nadir after definitive radiotherapy .
All patients received a single gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET / CT or PET / MR from mid - thigh to skull base .
Three members of a pool of nine independent central readers evaluated each scan for the presence and regional location ( 20 subregions grouped into four regions ) of abnormal gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake suggestive of recurrent prostate cancer .
The readers were blinded to all clinical information other than type of primary therapy and most recent serum PSA level .
A total of 469 patients ( 74 % ) had at least one positive region detected by gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET majority read .
The distribution of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET positive regions was 34 % bone , 25 % prostate bed , 25 % pelvic lymph node , and 17 % extrapelvic soft tissue .
Two hundred and ten patients had composite reference standard information collected in a PET positive region ( evaluable patients ) , consisting of at least one of the following : histopathology , imaging ( bone scintigraphy , CT , or MRI ) acquired at baseline or within 12 months after gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET , or serial serum PSA .
Composite reference standard information for gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET negative regions was not systematically collected in this study .
In the 210 evaluable patients , the mean age was 70 years ( range , 49 to 88 years ) and 82 % were 65 years of age or older .
White patients made up 90 % of the group .
The median serum PSA was 3 . 6 ng / mL .
Prior treatment included radical prostatectomy in 64 % and radiotherapy in 73 % .
Of the 210 evaluable patients , 192 patients ( 91 % ) were found to be true positive in one or more regions against the composite reference standard ( 95 % CI : 88 % , 95 % ) .
Among the pool of nine readers used in the study , the proportion of patients who were true positive in one or more regions ranged from 82 % to 97 % .
The prostate bed had the lowest proportion of true positive results at the region - level ( 76 % versus 96 % for non - prostate regions ) .
An exploratory analysis was also performed in which gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET positive patients who lacked reference standard information were imputed using an estimated likelihood that at least one location - matched PET positive lesion was reference standard positive based on patient - specific factors .
In this exploratory analysis , 340 of 475 patients ( 72 % ) were imputed as true positive in one or more regions ( 95 % CI : 68 % , 76 % ) .
In another exploratory analysis using the same imputation approach for PET positive patients who lacked reference standard information , 340 of 635 patients ( 54 % ) were correctly detected as true positive ( 95 % CI : 50 % , 57 % ) among all BCR patients who received a PET scan , whether it was read as positive or negative .
The likelihood of identifying a gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET positive lesion in this study generally increased with higher serum PSA level .
Table 8 shows the patient - level gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET results stratified by serum PSA level .
The mean time between PSA measurement and PET scan was 40 days with a range of 0 to 367 days .
Percent PET positivity was calculated as the proportion of patients with a positive gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET out of all patients scanned .
Percent PET positivity includes patients determined to be either true positive or false positive as well as those in whom such determination was not made due to the absence of composite reference standard data .

Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide was used to identify PSMA - positive patients on PET imaging .
Only PSMA - positive patients were eligible for randomization and receipt of lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan .
VISION A total of 1003 adult male patients with mCRPC received gallium Ga 68 gozetotide by intravenous administration and underwent PET imaging at approximately 60 minutes ( range , 50 to 100 minutes ) after injection .
Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET imaging was interpreted in conjunction with post - contrast CT and / or MRI of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis for all patients , and in addition to brain MRI and / or CT in patients with history of CNS metastasis .
Patients were males of median age 70 years ( range , 40 to 94 years ) , white ( 87 % ) , black or African American ( 7 % ) and Asian ( 2 . 4 % ) , and had median baseline PSA levels of 74 ng / mL ( range , 0 to 8995 ng / mL ) .
Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET and anatomical imaging was interpreted by one central reader who was blinded to clinical information and other PET and bone imaging .
PSMA - positive ( eligible ) patients were defined as those having at least one tumor lesion with gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake greater than normal liver and all tumor lesions larger than size criteria with gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake greater than liver [ short axis size criteria : organs ≥ 1 cm , lymph nodes ≥ 2 . 5 cm , bones ( soft tissue component ) ≥ 1 cm ] .
Of the patients evaluated by the central reader , 869 ( 87 % ) were found to be PSMA - positive ( eligible ) and 126 ( 13 % ) were found to be PSMA - negative ( ineligible ) for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan therapy .
A reader sub - study evaluated imaging interpretation agreement .
Among the 869 patients found eligible and 126 patients found ineligible for therapy , 75 and 50 , respectively , were selected at random ( total of 125 ) .
Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET and anatomical imaging from these 125 patients was interpreted by three additional central readers ( re - readers ) who were blinded to clinical information and other PET and bone imaging .
Imaging from 20 of the 125 patients was also randomly selected to assess intra - reader reproducibility .
The estimated inter - reader Fleiss κ was 0 . 60 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 50 , 0 . 70 ) across the three re - readers , while the estimated intra - reader Cohen κ was 0 . 78 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 49 , 0 . 99 ) , 0 . 76 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 46 , 0 . 99 ) and 0 . 89 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 67 , 0 . 99 ) for each re - reader .
Given the observed levels of inter - reader agreement , patient ’ s PSMA interpretations were further evaluated by eligibility and eligibility sub - criteria .
Of the 125 patients with four readers ( reader and re - readers ) , at least one reader found the patient to be PSMA - negative for lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan therapy in 59 patients .
All four readers agreed in 20 of the 59 patients ( 34 % reader unanimity ) .
Based on the sub - criteria involving evaluation of any one tumor lesion and evaluation of all lesions larger than size criteria , at least one reader found the patient to be PSMA - negative in 21 patients ( 43 % reader unanimity ) and 45 patients ( 16 % reader unanimity ) , respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
