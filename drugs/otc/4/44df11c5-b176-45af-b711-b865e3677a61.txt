2 . 4 Determination of Radiochemical Purity of Radiolabeled Lymphoseek Determine radiochemical purity of the reconstituted radiolabeled Lymphoseek by Instant Thin Layer Chromatography ( ITLC ) using either Whatman Grade 1 , 3 MM , 31 ET Chr or Biodex 150 - 001 Red Strips ( cellulose chromatography paper ) using the following method : • a . Mark the chromatographic strip for origin , mid and solvent front lines with a pencil as shown below : • [ MULTIMEDIA ] • • b . Apply a small drop ( 3 - 10 microliters ) of the reconstituted product at the center of the origin line chromatography strip .
Let the product spot dry .
• c . Place the strip into a chromatography chamber containing 1 mL of acetone as the developing solvent .
Allow the solvent to migrate to the solvent front line ( 5 cm from the bottom of the Whatman strips and 3 . 5 cm for the Biodex strip ) .
Remove the strip from the chamber , let it dry and cut it in half .
Count each half of the strip with a suitable radioactivity counting apparatus ( dose calibrator or multichannel analyzer ) .
• d . Calculate the percent radiochemical purity ( % RCP ) as follows : % RCP = Counts ( activity ) in bottom half x 100 Counts ( activity ) in bottom half + Counts ( activity ) in top half • e . Do not use the reconstituted Lymphoseek if the radiochemical purity is less than 90 % .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 . 5 Lymphatic Mapping and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Following Injection of Lymphoseek • • Lymphoscintigraphy may be used to assist in planning the lymph node mapping procedures .
In clinical studies , preoperative scintigraphic imaging was performed using planar imaging techniques and / or SPECT / CT to establish a map of nodal basins and to facilitate intraoperative identification of lymph nodes .
Imaging was performed as early as immediately after injection and up to 21 hours [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
• • Use a handheld gamma counter to identify nodes that concentrated the injected radioactivity .
• • For intraoperative lymphatic mapping , first measure the background radioactivity counts from tissue at least 20 centimeters distal to the injection site .
The three sigma threshold ( background radioactivity counts plus three times the square root of the mean background count ) may be used as an estimate of the threshold for positive localization of Lymphoseek , as exemplified in Table 2 .
Table 2 .
Examples of Three Sigma Threshold Valuesa Average of three 2 - second counts or one 10 - second count Background Counta ( cpm ) Threshold Value ( cpm ) 5 12 10 20 15 27 20 34 25 40 30 47 35 53 40 59 • • Lymphoseek is intended to supplement palpation , visual inspection , and other procedures important to lymph node mapping and sentinel node biopsy .
Intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy using gamma detection of Lymphoseek within lymph nodes should be initiated no sooner than 15 minutes following injection .
In clinical studies of breast cancer and melanoma , patients also received a concomitant blue dye tracer for comparative detection of lymph nodes .
While most lymph nodes were detected with Lymphoseek , some were detected only with the blue dye tracer or only with palpation [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
2 . 6 Radiation Dosimetry • • The radiation doses to organs and tissues of an adult patient weighing 70 kg given 18 . 5 MBq ( 0 . 5 mCi ) of Lymphoseek are shown in Table 3 .
For pediatric patients , effective dose equivalent ranged from 355 microSv to 1 , 232 microSv .
Table 3 .
Estimated Absorbed Radiation Dose from 18 . 5 MBq ( 0 . 5 mCi ) Lymphoseek in Adult Patients with Breast Cancer and Melanomaa Calculated from data of 18 patients with breast cancer who received four peritumoral injections of 4 mcg , 20 mcg , and 100 mcg doses of Lymphoseek .
b Calculated from data of 18 patients with melanoma who received four intradermal injections of 20 mcg , 100 mcg , and 200 mcg doses of Lymphoseek .
Due to the differences in injection sites among patients with melanoma , the injection site was assumed to be the breast for the purposes of this calculation , as it represents the nearest anatomical construct for the skin from the anatomical sites appropriately included in the estimates .

In open label , single arm clinical trials , 553 adult patients with either breast cancer , melanoma , or squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity , skin , and lip received Lymphoseek .
No patients experienced serious adverse reactions .
Injection site irritation ( 4 patients ; 0 . 7 % ) and pain ( 1 patient ; 0 . 2 % ) were reported .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation .
To decrease radiation exposure to the breastfed child , advise a lactating woman to pump and discard breast milk after the administration of Lymphoseek for 24 hours .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Lymphoseek use in pregnant women .
Additionally , animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with technetium Tc 99 m tilmanocept .
However , all radiopharmaceuticals , including Lymphoseek , have a potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose .
If considering Lymphoseek administration to a pregnant woman , inform the patient about the potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes based on the radiation dose from the drug and the gestational timing of exposure .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively , regardless of drug exposure .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of technetium Tc 99 m tilmanocept in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed child , or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Exposure of Lymphoseek to a breastfed child can be decreased by temporary discontinuation of breastfeeding [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Lymphoseek and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Lymphoseek or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations To decrease radiation exposure to the breastfed child , advise a lactating woman to pump and discard breast milk after the administration of Lymphoseek for 24 hours .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Lymphoseek have been established in pediatric patients 1 month of age and older .
Use of Lymphoseek for this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies in adults with additional safety and diagnostic data from an open - label , single - arm trial in 23 pediatric patients with either melanoma ( 5 ) , rhabdomyosarcoma ( 4 ) , or other solid tumors ( 14 ) who received Lymphoseek ( 18 . 5 MBq and 50 mcg ) and underwent intraoperative lymphatic mapping , with or without additional use of preoperative scintigraphic imaging and / or blue dye [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Review of the clinical data , including evaluation of the frequency of adverse reactions and localization of lymph nodes , has not identified differences in safety or efficacy between pediatric patients and older patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 553 adult patients enrolled in clinical studies of breast cancer , melanoma , and squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of oral cavity , skin , and lip , 179 ( 32 % ) were aged 65 or older .
Review of the clinical data , including evaluation of the frequency of adverse reactions , has not identified differences in safety or efficacy between elderly patients ( 65 to 90 years of age ) and younger adult patients ( 18 to 65 years of age ) .

It accumulates in lymphatic tissue and selectively binds to mannose binding receptors ( CD206 ) located on the surface of macrophages and dendritic cells .
Technetium Tc 99 m tilmanocept is a macromolecule consisting of multiple units of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ( DTPA ) and mannose , each covalently attached to a 10 kDa dextran backbone .
The mannose acts as a ligand for the receptor , and the DTPA serves as a chelating agent for labeling with technetium Tc 99 m .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In in vitro studies , technetium Tc 99 m tilmanocept exhibited binding to human mannose binding receptors with a primary binding site affinity of Kd = 2 . 76 x 10 - 11 M .
In clinical studies , technetium Tc 99 m tilmanocept has been detectable in lymph nodes within 10 minutes and up to 30 hours after injection .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In dose - ranging clinical studies , injection site clearance rates were similar across all Lymphoseek doses ( 4 to 200 mcg ) with a mean elimination rate constant in the range of 0 . 222 to 0 . 396 / hr , resulting in a drug half - life at the injection site of 1 . 8 to 3 . 1 hours .
The amount of the accumulated radioactive dose in the liver , kidney , and bladder reached a maximum 1 hour post administration of Lymphoseek and was approximately 1 % to 2 % of the injected dose in each tissue .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies to assess the carcinogenicity potential of tilmanocept have not been conducted .
Tilmanocept was not mutagenic in vitro in the Ames bacterial mutation assay and in the in vitro mouse lymphoma test , and was negative in the in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Studies on reproductive fertility have not been conducted .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Overview of Clinical Studies The efficacy and safety of Lymphoseek were assessed in three open - label , multicenter , single arm trials of adult patients with melanoma , breast cancer , or squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the oral cavity , skin , and lip ( Studies 1 , 2 , and 3 ) and one open - label , multicenter , single arm trial of pediatric patients with melanoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , or other solid tumor ( Study 4 ) .
Prior to the lymph node mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures , patients had no known regional nodal or metastatic disease by standard clinical staging criteria .
• • In Studies 1 and 2 , Lymphoseek was evaluated in adult patients with breast cancer and melanoma .
Diagnostic efficacy for lymphatic mapping was determined by the number of histology - confirmed lymph nodes detected by Lymphoseek and / or the blue dye comparator .
Lymphoseek was injected into patients at least 15 minutes prior to initiating lymphatic mapping procedures , and preoperative scintigraphic imaging was performed in 91 % of patients .
Separately , blue dye was injected shortly prior to initiation of the surgery .
Lymphatic mapping was performed intraoperatively using a handheld gamma detection probe followed by excision of lymph nodes identified by Lymphoseek , blue dye , or the surgeon ’ s visual and palpation examination .
The resected lymph nodes were evaluated by histopathology .
Lymphoseek localization rate in pathology - positive lymph nodes was also determined .
• oIn Study 1 , of 179 patients who received Lymphoseek , 94 ( 53 % ) had known or suspected breast cancer and 85 ( 47 % ) had known or suspected melanoma .
The median age was 59 years ( range 20 to 90 years ) and most ( 72 % ) were female .
• oIn Study 2 , of 153 patients who received Lymphoseek , 77 ( 50 % ) had known or suspected breast cancer and 76 ( 50 % ) had known or suspected melanoma .
The median age was 61 years ( range 26 to 88 years ) and most ( 68 % ) were female .
• • In Study 3 , Lymphoseek was evaluated in adult patients primarily with SCC of the oral cavity ( T1 - T4a , N0 , M0 ) .
Diagnostic efficacy was determined by the patient level false negative rate of sentinel lymph node detection by Lymphoseek as confirmed by pathologic assessment of all lymph nodes removed during planned elective neck dissection ( END ) .
Lymphoseek was administered at least 15 minutes prior to the scheduled surgery and preoperative scintigraphic imaging was performed in all patients .
Lymphatic mapping was performed intraoperatively using a handheld gamma counter followed by excision of sentinel lymph nodes identified by Lymphoseek .
Additional lymph nodes were removed during the END based upon tumor location and surgical practice .
All resected lymph nodes ( sentinel and non - sentinel ) were evaluated for histopathology at the local site .
Lymphoseek - identified nodes determined negative for cancer were further evaluated by a central pathology laboratory using additional step sectioning and cytokeratin staining .
• oOf the 85 patients who received Lymphoseek , 79 ( 93 % ) had intraoral SCC and 6 ( 7 % ) had cutaneous SCC .
The median age was 59 years ( range 23 to 87 years ) and most ( 75 % ) were male .
• • In Study 4 , Lymphoseek was evaluated in pediatric patients with melanoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , or other solid tumor .
Safety and diagnostic efficacy for lymphatic mapping were determined .
Lymphoseek was injected into patients at least 15 minutes prior to initiating lymphatic mapping procedures , and preoperative scintigraphic imaging was performed in 91 % of patients .
Blue dye was injected prior to initiation of the surgery in 21 patients .
Lymphatic mapping was performed intraoperatively using a handheld gamma detection probe followed by excision of lymph nodes identified by Lymphoseek , blue dye ( when used adjunctively ) , or the surgeon ’ s visual and palpation examination .
The resected lymph nodes were evaluated by histopathology .
Lymphoseek localization rate in pathology - positive lymph nodes was also determined .
• oOf the 23 patients who received Lymphoseek , 5 ( 22 % ) had melanoma , 4 ( 17 % ) had rhabdomyosarcoma , 12 ( 52 % ) had non - rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas , and 2 ( 9 % ) had atypical Spitz nevi .
The mean age was 11 . 6 years ( range 1 . 7 to 17 years ) and most ( 65 % ) were female .
14 . 2 Lymphoscintigraphy An analysis of the four studies was performed to evaluate the agreement in location of lymph nodes identified by scintigraphic imaging and the handheld gamma counter .
At least one scintigraphic “ hot spot ” was identified in 95 % of patients imaged ; the percentages were similar across tumor types and age groups .
Overall in the adult patients , there was 84 % agreement on a nodal level ( when considering all missing observations as disagreement , as worst case scenario ) between the location of preoperative scintigraphic imaging hot spots and the intraoperative lymph node findings ( Table 7 ) .
Missing observations took the following form : 43 hot spots without corresponding hot nodes and 31 hot nodes without corresponding hot spots .

Evaluable lymph nodes were resected from 176 Study 1 patients and 152 Study 2 patients who received Lymphoseek at the dose of 0 . 5 to 2 mCi in 50 mcg administered 15 minutes to 30 hours prior to surgery .
Table 8 shows the distribution of resected lymph nodes by the presence or absence of a tracer .
Most of the resected lymph nodes were identified by either Lymphoseek ( LS ) or blue dye ( BD ) or both .
Significantly more resected lymph nodes were identified by Lymphoseek in comparison to blue dye .

The overall rate of lymph node detection by Lymphoseek at the patient level was 97 % ( 319 / 328 ) .
The average number of lymph nodes detected by Lymphoseek was approximately 2 per patient .
In Study 3 lymphatic mapping was performed in 83 adult patients with SCC of the oral cavity .
The rate of lymph node detection by Lymphoseek at the patient level was 98 % ( 81 / 83 ) with a 95 % confidence interval of 92 % to 100 % .
The average number of lymph nodes identified was 4 per patient .
In Study 4 lymphatic mapping was performed in 23 pediatric patients with melanoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , and other solid tumors .
The overall rate of lymph node detection by Lymphoseek at the patient level was 96 % ( 22 / 23 ) when the detection rate is defined as at least one lymph node in a patient can be detected .
The average number of lymph nodes detected by Lymphoseek was approximately 3 per patient .
Of the 79 nodes in 21 patients who also received blue dye , all of 47 nodes identified by blue dye were also identified by Lymphoseek ; a total of 74 nodes were identified by Lymphoseek .
14 . 4 Guiding Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy In Study 3 in patients with SCC of the oral cavity ( n = 79 ) , skin ( n = 5 ) , and lip ( n = 1 ) , pathology findings for Lymphoseek - identified nodes ( sentinel lymph nodes ) were compared to the pathology findings of all other lymph nodes removed during the scheduled elective node dissection to determine the false negative rate of Lymphoseek .
Thirty - nine patients were determined to have pathology - positive regional lymph nodes .
In these patients , the Lymphoseek false negative rate for detecting patients with cancer - positive nodes was 2 . 6 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 06 % to 13 . 5 % ) .
In this study the pathology - positive nodes were all found in patients with SCC of the oral cavity .
Supportive analyses were conducted in Studies 1 and 2 in patients with breast cancer or melanoma , and Study 4 in pediatric patients .
The presence or absence of Lymphoseek in nodes resected from patients determined by pathology staging to have lymphatic spread of cancer ( n = 66 ) was evaluated .
The overall patient level rate for identifying at least one cancer - positive node in these pathology - positive patients ( both cancers combined ) was 97 % .
Lymphoseek identified 27 out of 29 node positive adult patients with breast cancer , all of the 35 node positive adult patients with melanoma , and both of the 2 node positive pediatric patients ( 1 melanoma and 1 rhabdomyosarcoma ) .
