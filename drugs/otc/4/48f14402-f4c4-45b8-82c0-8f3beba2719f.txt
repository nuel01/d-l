5 . 2 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles , including Noxafil , have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram .
In addition , cases of torsades de pointes have been reported in patients taking Noxafil .
Results from a multiple time - matched ECG analysis in healthy volunteers did not show any increase in the mean of the QTc interval .
Multiple , time - matched ECGs collected over a 12 - hour period were recorded at baseline and steady - state from 173 healthy male and female volunteers ( 18 - 85 years of age ) administered Noxafil oral suspension 400 mg twice daily with a high - fat meal .
In this pooled analysis , the mean QTc ( Fridericia ) interval change from baseline was – 5 msec following administration of the recommended clinical dose .
A decrease in the QTc ( F ) interval ( – 3 msec ) was also observed in a small number of subjects ( n = 16 ) administered placebo .
The placebo - adjusted mean maximum QTc ( F ) interval change from baseline was < 0 msec ( – 8 msec ) .
No healthy subject administered Noxafil had a QTc ( F ) interval ≥ 500 msec or an increase ≥ 60 msec in their QTc ( F ) interval from baseline .
Noxafil should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions .
Do not administer with drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval and are metabolized through CYP3A4 [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 3 Electrolyte Disturbances Electrolyte disturbances , especially those involving potassium , magnesium or calcium levels , should be monitored and corrected as necessary before and during Noxafil therapy .
5 . 4 Hepatic Toxicity Hepatic reactions ( e . g . , mild to moderate elevations in alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alkaline phosphatase , total bilirubin , and / or clinical hepatitis ) have been reported in clinical trials .
The elevations in liver tests were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy , and in some instances these tests normalized without drug interruption .
Cases of more severe hepatic reactions including cholestasis or hepatic failure including deaths have been reported in patients with serious underlying medical conditions ( e . g . , hematologic malignancy ) during treatment with Noxafil .
These severe hepatic reactions were seen primarily in subjects receiving the Noxafil oral suspension 800 mg daily ( 400 mg twice daily or 200 mg four times a day ) in clinical trials .
Liver tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of Noxafil therapy .
Patients who develop abnormal liver tests during Noxafil therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury .
Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function ( particularly liver tests and bilirubin ) .
Discontinuation of Noxafil must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to Noxafil .
5 . 5 Renal Impairment Due to the variability in exposure with Noxafil delayed - release tablets , Noxafil oral suspension , and Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension , patients with severe renal impairment should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 9 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Noxafil injection should be avoided in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment ( eGFR < 50 mL / min ) , unless an assessment of the benefit / risk to the patient justifies the use of Noxafil injection .
In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment ( eGFR < 50 mL / min ) , receiving the Noxafil injection , accumulation of the intravenous vehicle , SBECD , is expected to occur .
Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients , and , if increases occur , consideration should be given to changing to oral Noxafil therapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 9 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 6 Midazolam Toxicity Concomitant administration of Noxafil with midazolam increases the midazolam plasma concentrations by approximately 5 - fold .
Increased plasma midazolam concentrations could potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects .
Patients must be monitored closely for adverse effects associated with high plasma concentrations of midazolam and benzodiazepine receptor antagonists must be available to reverse these effects [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Vincristine Toxicity Concomitant administration of azole antifungals , including Noxafil , with vincristine has been associated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions , including seizures , peripheral neuropathy , syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion , and paralytic ileus .
Reserve azole antifungals , including Noxafil , for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid , including vincristine , who have no alternative antifungal treatment options [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 10 ) ] .
5 . 8 Risk in Patients with Hereditary Fructose Intolerance ( HFI ) Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension contains sorbitol , an inactive ingredient , and may precipitate a metabolic crisis that may include , but is not limited to life - threatening hypoglycemia , hypophosphatemia , lactic acidosis , and hepatic failure in patients with HFI .
Obtain careful history of HFI symptoms ( nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain ) with sorbitol / fructose / sucrose exposure prior to Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension administration because a diagnosis of HFI may not yet be established in pediatric patients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 9 Breakthrough Fungal Infections Patients who have severe diarrhea or vomiting should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections when receiving Noxafil delayed - release tablets , Noxafil oral suspension , or Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension .
5 . 10 Venetoclax Toxicity Concomitant administration of Noxafil , a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , with venetoclax may increase venetoclax toxicities , including the risk of tumor lysis syndrome ( TLS ) , neutropenia , and serious infections .
In patients with CLL / SLL , administration of Noxafil during initiation and the ramp - up phase of venetoclax is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 6 ) ] .
Refer to the venetoclax labeling for safety monitoring and dose reduction in the steady daily dosing phase in CLL / SLL patients .
For patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , dose reduction and safety monitoring are recommended across all dosing phases when coadministering Noxafil with venetoclax [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 16 ) ] .
Refer to the venetoclax prescribing information for dosing instructions .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of Noxafil cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Clinical Trial Experience in Adults Clinical Trial Experience with Noxafil Injection and Noxafil Delayed - Release Tablets for the Treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis The safety of Noxafil injection and Noxafil delayed - release tablet was assessed in a randomized , double - blind , active - controlled clinical study of Noxafil injection and Noxafil delayed - release tablets versus voriconazole for treatment of invasive aspergillosis ( Aspergillosis Treatment Study ) .
A total of 575 ( 288 in Noxafil arm , 287 in voriconazole arm ) adult and pediatric patients 13 years of age and older with proven , probable or possible invasive aspergillosis were included .
The median duration of treatment was 67 days for Noxafil injection or Noxafil delayed - release tablet and 64 days for voriconazole , with 55 % to 60 % of subjects starting treatment with the IV formulation of either drug .
The median duration of the first instance of IV treatment ( before switching to oral treatment or discontinuing or completing study treatment ) was 9 days for both groups .
Table 7 presents adverse reactions reported at an incidence of ≥ 10 % in either one of the groups in Aspergillosis Treatment Study .
Adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were reported for 33 . 9 % of subjects .
The most commonly reported adverse reactions ( > 2 % of subjects ) leading to treatment discontinuation were septic shock , respiratory failure , and bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in the Noxafil arm , and septic shock and acute myeloid leukemia in the voriconazole arm .

Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatrics Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients ( 2 to less than 18 Years of Age ) The safety of Noxafil injection and Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections has been assessed in an open label uncontrolled dose - ranging PK and safety study ( Noxafil injection / Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension Pediatric Study 1 , NCT02452034 ) ; hereinafter referred to as Noxafil Pediatric Study ) in 115 immunocompromised pediatric patients 2 to less than 18 years of age with known or expected neutropenia .
Noxafil injection and Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension was administered at daily doses of up to 6 mg / kg ( twice daily on day 1 ) in three dose cohorts .
All 115 subjects initially received Noxafil injection for at least 7 days , and 63 subjects were transitioned to Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension .
The mean overall treatment duration for all treated subjects was 20 . 6 days with 14 . 3 days ( range : 1 to 28 days ) on Noxafil injection and 11 . 6 days ( range : 2 to 18 days ) on Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Table 15 presents adverse reactions observed in greater than or equal to 10 % of pediatric patients treated with Noxafil in the Noxafil Pediatric Study .
Reported adverse reaction profile of Noxafil in pediatric patients was consistent with the safety profile of Noxafil in adults .
The most common adverse reactions ( occurring in greater than 20 % of pediatric patients receiving 6 mg / kg Noxafil injection and Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension daily dose ) were pyrexia , febrile neutropenia , vomiting , mucosal inflammation , pruritus , hypertension , hypokalemia , and stomatitis .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during the post - approval use of Noxafil .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency .
Endocrine Disorders : Pseudoaldosteronism 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Posaconazole is primarily metabolized via UDP glucuronosyltransferase and is a substrate of p - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) efflux .
Therefore , inhibitors or inducers of these clearance pathways may affect posaconazole plasma concentrations .
Coadministration of drugs that can decrease the plasma concentrations of posaconazole should generally be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the risk .
If such drugs are necessary , patients should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections .
Posaconazole is also a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 .
Therefore , plasma concentrations of drugs predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 may be increased by posaconazole [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The following information was derived from data with Noxafil oral suspension or early tablet formulation unless otherwise noted .
All drug interactions with Noxafil oral suspension , except for those that affect the absorption of posaconazole ( via gastric pH and motility ) , are considered relevant to Noxafil injection , Noxafil delayed - release tablet , and Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension as well [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 9 ) and ( 7 . 13 ) ] .
Interaction Drug Interaction Rifabutin , phenytoin , efavirenz , cimetidine , esomeprazole [ 1 ] Avoid coadministration unless the benefit outweighs the risks ( 7 . 6 , 7 . 7 , 7 . 8 , 7 . 9 ) Other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 Consider dosage adjustment and monitor for adverse effects and toxicity ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 10 , 7 . 11 ) Digoxin Monitor digoxin plasma concentrations ( 7 . 12 ) Fosamprenavir , metoclopramide null Monitor for breakthrough fungal infections ( 7 . 6 , 7 . 13 ) [ 1 ] The drug interactions with esomeprazole and metoclopramide do not apply to Noxafil tablets .
7 . 1 Immunosuppressants Metabolized by CYP3A4 Sirolimus : Concomitant administration of Noxafil with sirolimus increases the sirolimus blood concentrations by approximately 9 - fold and can result in sirolimus toxicity .
Therefore , posaconazole is contraindicated with sirolimus [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Tacrolimus : Noxafil has been shown to significantly increase the Cmax and AUC of tacrolimus .
At initiation of posaconazole treatment , reduce the tacrolimus dose to approximately one - third of the original dose .
Frequent monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations should be performed during and at discontinuation of Noxafil treatment and the tacrolimus dose adjusted accordingly [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Cyclosporine : Noxafil has been shown to increase cyclosporine whole blood concentrations in heart transplant patients upon initiation of Noxafil treatment .
It is recommended to reduce cyclosporine dose to approximately three - fourths of the original dose upon initiation of Noxafil treatment .
Frequent monitoring of cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations should be performed during and at discontinuation of Noxafil treatment and the cyclosporine dose adjusted accordingly [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 CYP3A4 Substrates Concomitant administration of Noxafil with CYP3A4 substrates such as pimozide and quinidine may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs , leading to QTc prolongation and cases of torsades de pointes .
Therefore , Noxafil is contraindicated with these drugs [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
7 . 3 HMG - CoA Reductase Inhibitors ( Statins ) Primarily Metabolized Through CYP3A4 Concomitant administration of Noxafil with simvastatin increases the simvastatin plasma concentrations by approximately 10 - fold .
Therefore , Noxafil is contraindicated with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors primarily metabolized through CYP3A4 [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 4 Ergot Alkaloids Most of the ergot alkaloids are substrates of CYP3A4 .
Noxafil may increase the plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids ( ergotamine and dihydroergotamine ) which may lead to ergotism .
Therefore , Noxafil is contraindicated with ergot alkaloids [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 5 ) ] .
7 . 5 Benzodiazepines Metabolized by CYP3A4 Concomitant administration of Noxafil with midazolam increases the midazolam plasma concentrations by approximately 5 - fold .
Increased plasma midazolam concentrations could potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects .
Concomitant use of Noxafil and other benzodiazepines metabolized by CYP3A4 ( e . g . , alprazolam , triazolam ) could result in increased plasma concentrations of these benzodiazepines .
Patients must be monitored closely for adverse effects associated with high plasma concentrations of benzodiazepines metabolized by CYP3A4 and benzodiazepine receptor antagonists must be available to reverse these effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 6 Anti - HIV Drugs Efavirenz : Efavirenz induces UDP - glucuronidase and significantly decreases posaconazole plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
It is recommended to avoid concomitant use of efavirenz with Noxafil unless the benefit outweighs the risks .
Ritonavir and Atazanavir : Ritonavir and atazanavir are metabolized by CYP3A4 and Noxafil increases plasma concentrations of these drugs [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Frequent monitoring of adverse effects and toxicity of ritonavir and atazanavir should be performed during coadministration with Noxafil .
Fosamprenavir : Combining fosamprenavir with Noxafil may lead to decreased posaconazole plasma concentrations .
If concomitant administration is required , close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections is recommended [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 7 Rifabutin Rifabutin induces UDP - glucuronidase and decreases posaconazole plasma concentrations .
Rifabutin is also metabolized by CYP3A4 .
Therefore , coadministration of rifabutin with Noxafil increases rifabutin plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Concomitant use of Noxafil and rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk .
However , if concomitant administration is required , close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections as well as frequent monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions due to increased rifabutin plasma concentrations ( e . g . , uveitis , leukopenia ) are recommended .
7 . 8 Phenytoin Phenytoin induces UDP - glucuronidase and decreases posaconazole plasma concentrations .
Phenytoin is also metabolized by CYP3A4 .
Therefore , coadministration of phenytoin with Noxafil increases phenytoin plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Concomitant use of Noxafil and phenytoin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk .
However , if concomitant administration is required , close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections is recommended and frequent monitoring of phenytoin concentrations should be performed while coadministered with Noxafil and dose reduction of phenytoin should be considered .
7 . 9 Gastric Acid Suppressors / Neutralizers Noxafil Delayed - Release Tablet and Noxafil PowderMix for Delayed - Release Oral Suspension : No clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole were observed when Noxafil delayed - release tablets are concomitantly used with antacids , H2 - receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment of Noxafil delayed - release tablets or Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension is required when concomitantly used with antacids , H2 - receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors .
Noxafil Oral Suspension : Cimetidine ( an H2 - receptor antagonist ) and esomeprazole ( a proton pump inhibitor ) when given with Noxafil oral suspension results in decreased posaconazole plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
It is recommended to avoid concomitant use of cimetidine and esomeprazole with Noxafil oral suspension unless the benefit outweighs the risks .
However , if concomitant administration is required , close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections is recommended .
No clinically relevant effects were observed when Noxafil oral suspension is concomitantly used with antacids and H2 - receptor antagonists other than cimetidine .
No dosage adjustment of Noxafil oral suspension is required when Noxafil oral suspension is concomitantly used with antacids and H2 - receptor antagonists other than cimetidine .
7 . 10 Vinca Alkaloids Most of the vinca alkaloids ( e . g . , vincristine and vinblastine ) are substrates of CYP3A4 .
Concomitant administration of azole antifungals , including Noxafil , with vincristine has been associated with serious adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Noxafil may increase the plasma concentrations of vinca alkaloids which may lead to neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions .
Therefore , reserve azole antifungals , including Noxafil , for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid , including vincristine , who have no alternative antifungal treatment options .
7 . 11 Calcium Channel Blockers Metabolized by CYP3A4 Noxafil may increase the plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 ( e . g . , verapamil , diltiazem , nifedipine , nicardipine , felodipine ) .
Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers is recommended during coadministration .
Dose reduction of calcium channel blockers may be needed .
7 . 12 Digoxin Increased plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported in patients receiving digoxin and Noxafil .
Therefore , monitoring of digoxin plasma concentrations is recommended during coadministration .
7 . 13 Gastrointestinal Motility Agents Noxafil Delayed - Release Tablet and Noxafil PowderMix for Delayed - Release Oral Suspension : Concomitant administration of metoclopramide with Noxafil delayed - release tablets did not affect the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment of Noxafil delayed - release tablets or Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension is required when given concomitantly with metoclopramide .
Noxafil Oral Suspension : Metoclopramide , when given with Noxafil oral suspension , decreases posaconazole plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
If metoclopramide is concomitantly administered with Noxafil oral suspension , it is recommended to closely monitor for breakthrough fungal infections .
Loperamide does not affect posaconazole plasma concentrations after Noxafil oral suspension administration [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment of Noxafil oral suspension is required when loperamide and Noxafil oral suspension are used concomitantly .
7 . 14 Glipizide Although no dosage adjustment of glipizide is required , it is recommended to monitor glucose concentrations when Noxafil and glipizide are concomitantly used .
7 . 15 Alcohol Posaconazole was found to release faster from Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension in the presence of alcohol in vitro , which may interfere with its delayed release characteristics .
Administration of Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension with alcohol is not recommended [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 16 Venetoclax Concomitant use of venetoclax ( a CYP3A4 substrate ) with posaconazole increases venetoclax Cmax and AUC0 - INF , which may increase venetoclax toxicities [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 6 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] .
Refer to the venetoclax prescribing information for more information on the dosing instructions and the extent of increase in venetoclax exposure .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Pediatrics : Safety and effectiveness in patients younger than 2 years of age have not been established .
( 8 . 4 ) • Severe Renal Impairment : Monitor closely for breakthrough fungal infections .
( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal data , Noxafil may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
Available data for use of Noxafil in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , skeletal malformations ( cranial malformations and missing ribs ) and maternal toxicity ( reduced food consumption and reduced body weight gain ) were observed when posaconazole was dosed orally to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses ≥ 1 . 4 times the 400 mg twice daily oral suspension regimen based on steady - state plasma concentrations of Noxafil in healthy volunteers .
In pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis , increased resorptions , reduced litter size , and reduced body weight gain of females were seen at doses 5 times the exposure achieved with the 400 mg twice daily oral suspension regimen .
Doses of ≥ 3 times the clinical exposure caused an increase in resorptions in these rabbits ( see Data ) .
Based on animal data , advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Posaconazole resulted in maternal toxicity ( reduced food consumption and reduced body weight gain ) and skeletal malformations ( cranial malformations and missing ribs ) when given orally to pregnant rats during organogenesis ( Gestational Days 6 through 15 ) at doses ≥ 27 mg / kg ( ≥ 1 . 4 times the 400 mg twice daily oral suspension regimen based on steady - state plasma concentrations of drug in healthy volunteers ) .
The no - effect dose for malformations and maternal toxicity in rats was 9 mg / kg , which is 0 . 7 times the exposure achieved with the 400 mg twice daily oral suspension regimen .
No malformations were seen in rabbits dosed during organogenesis ( Gestational Days 7 through 19 ) at doses up to 80 mg / kg ( 5 times the exposure achieved with the 400 mg twice daily oral suspension regimen ) .
In the rabbit , the no - effect dose was 20 mg / kg , while high doses of 40 mg / kg and 80 mg / kg ( 3 or 5 times the clinical exposure ) caused an increase in resorptions .
In rabbits dosed at 80 mg / kg , a reduction in body weight gain of females and a reduction in litter size were seen .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of posaconazole in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Posaconazole is excreted in the milk of lactating rats .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for Noxafil and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Noxafil or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Noxafil injection , Noxafil delayed - release tablets , Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension , and Noxafil oral suspension for the prophylaxis of invasive Aspergillus and Candida infections have been established in pediatric patients aged 2 and older who are at high risk of developing these infections due to being severely immunocompromised , such as HSCT recipients with GVHD or those with hematologic malignancies with prolonged neutropenia from chemotherapy .
The safety and effectiveness of Noxafil injection and Noxafil delayed - release tablets for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis have been established in pediatric patients aged 13 years and older .
The safety and effectiveness of Noxafil oral suspension have been established for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) , including OPC refractory ( rOPC ) to itraconazole and / or fluconazole in pediatric patients aged 13 years and older .
Use of Noxafil in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of Noxafil in adult and pediatric patients and additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of Noxafil have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age .
Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension is not recommended for use in patients who weigh greater than 40 kg because the recommended dosage cannot be achieved with this formulation .
Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension is contraindicated in patients with HFI .
Because a diagnosis of HFI may not yet be established in pediatric patients , obtain a careful history of HFI symptoms with sorbitol / fructose / sucrose exposure prior to administration of Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in the safety of Noxafil injection , Noxafil delayed - release tablets , and Noxafil oral suspension were observed between geriatric patients and younger adult patients in the clinical trials ; therefore , no dosage adjustment is recommended for any formulation of Noxafil in geriatric patients .
No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of Noxafil were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients during clinical trials [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Of the 279 patients treated with Noxafil injection in the Noxafil Injection Study , 52 ( 19 % ) were greater than 65 years of age .
Of the 230 patients treated with Noxafil delayed - release tablets , 38 ( 17 % ) were greater than 65 years of age .
Of the 605 patients randomized to Noxafil oral suspension in Noxafil Oral Suspension Study 1 and Study 2 , 63 ( 10 % ) were ≥ 65 years of age .
In addition , 48 patients treated with greater than or equal to 800 - mg / day Noxafil oral suspension in another indication were ≥ 65 years of age .
Of the 288 patients randomized to Noxafil injection / Noxafil delayed - release tablets in the Aspergillosis Treatment Study , 85 ( 29 % ) were ≥ 65 years of age .
No overall differences in the pharmacokinetics and safety were observed between elderly and young subjects during clinical trials , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Following single - dose administration of 400 mg of the Noxafil oral suspension , there was no significant effect of mild ( eGFR : 50 - 80 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , n = 6 ) or moderate ( eGFR : 20 - 49 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , n = 6 ) renal impairment on posaconazole pharmacokinetics ; therefore , no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment .
In subjects with severe renal impairment ( eGFR : < 20 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , the mean plasma exposure ( AUC ) was similar to that in patients with normal renal function ( eGFR : > 80 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) ; however , the range of the AUC estimates was highly variable ( CV = 96 % ) in these subjects with severe renal impairment as compared to that in the other renal impairment groups ( CV < 40 % ) .
Due to the variability in exposure , patients with severe renal impairment should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Similar recommendations apply to Noxafil delayed - release tablets ; however , a specific study has not been conducted with the Noxafil delayed - release tablets .
Noxafil injection should be avoided in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment ( eGFR < 50 mL / min ) , unless an assessment of the benefit / risk to the patient justifies the use of Noxafil injection .
In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment ( eGFR < 50 mL / min ) , receiving the Noxafil injection , accumulation of the intravenous vehicle , SBECD , is expected to occur .
Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients , and , if increases occur , consideration should be given to changing to oral Noxafil therapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 9 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of Noxafil oral suspension 400 mg , the mean AUC was 43 % , 27 % , and 21 % higher in subjects with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A , N = 6 ) , moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B , N = 6 ) , or severe ( Child - Pugh Class C , N = 6 ) hepatic impairment , respectively , compared to subjects with normal hepatic function ( N = 18 ) .
Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function , the mean Cmax was 1 % higher , 40 % higher , and 34 % lower in subjects with mild , moderate , or severe hepatic impairment , respectively .
The mean apparent oral clearance ( CL / F ) was reduced by 18 % , 36 % , and 28 % in subjects with mild , moderate , or severe hepatic impairment , respectively , compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
The elimination half - life ( t ½ ) was 27 hours , 39 hours , 27 hours , and 43 hours in subjects with normal hepatic function and mild , moderate , or severe hepatic impairment , respectively .
It is recommended that no dose adjustment of Noxafil oral suspension , Noxafil delayed - release tablets , Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension , and Noxafil injection is needed in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A , B , or C ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
However , a specific study has not been conducted with Noxafil delayed - release tablets , Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension , and Noxafil injection .
8 . 8 Gender The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole are comparable in males and females .
No adjustment in the dosage of Noxafil is necessary based on gender .
8 . 9 Race The pharmacokinetic profile of posaconazole is not significantly affected by race .
No adjustment in the dosage of Noxafil is necessary based on race .
8 . 10 Weight Pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that patients weighing greater than 120 kg may have lower posaconazole plasma drug exposure .
It is , therefore , suggested to closely monitor for breakthrough fungal infections particularly when using Noxafil oral suspension [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no experience with overdosage of Noxafil injection and Noxafil delayed - release tablets .
During the clinical trials , some patients received Noxafil oral suspension up to 1600 mg / day with no adverse reactions noted that were different from the lower doses .
In addition , accidental overdose was noted in one patient who took 1200 mg twice daily Noxafil oral suspension for 3 days .
No related adverse reactions were noted by the investigator .
Posaconazole is not removed by hemodialysis .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Posaconazole is an azole antifungal agent [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure Response Relationship Prophylaxis : In clinical studies of neutropenic patients who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) or myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) or hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) recipients with Graft versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) , a wide range of plasma exposures to posaconazole was noted following administration of Noxafil oral suspension .
A pharmacokinetic - pharmacodynamic analysis of patient data revealed an apparent association between average posaconazole concentrations ( Cavg ) and prophylactic efficacy ( Table 17 ) .
A lower Cavg may be associated with an increased risk of treatment failure , defined as treatment discontinuation , use of empiric systemic antifungal therapy ( SAF ) , or occurrence of breakthrough invasive fungal infections .

Similarly , across a range of population pharmacokinetic model - predicted steady - state plasma average concentrations ( Cavg , range : 589 to 6315 ng / mL ) , there was no association between posaconazole Cavg and treatment efficacy .

Steady - state plasma concentrations are attained by Day 6 at the 300 mg dose ( once daily after twice daily loading dose at Day 1 ) .
The absolute bioavailability of the oral delayed - release tablet is approximately 54 % under fasted conditions .
The Cmax and AUC of posaconazole following administration of Noxafil delayed - release tablets is increased 16 % and 51 % , respectively , when given with a high fat meal compared to a fasted state ( see Table 22 ) .

Noxafil PowderMix for Delayed - Release Oral Suspension The absolute bioavailability of the Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension is approximately 70 - 80 % .
The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension has not been determined .
Concomitant administration of Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension with drugs affecting gastric pH or gastric motility would not be expected to demonstrate any significant effects on posaconazole pharmacokinetic exposure based on similarity to the delayed - release tablets .
An in vitro dissolution study was conducted to evaluate the impact of alcohol ( 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 % ) on the dissolution of Noxafil PowderMix delayed - release oral suspension .
The study showed alcohol - induced dose - dumping potential with the Noxafil PowderMix delayed - release oral suspension [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 15 ) ] .
Noxafil Oral Suspension Noxafil oral suspension is absorbed with a median Tmax of ~ 3 to 5 hours .
Steady - state plasma concentrations are attained at 7 to 10 days following multiple - dose administration .
Following single - dose administration of 200 mg , the mean AUC and Cmax of posaconazole are approximately 3 - times higher when the oral suspension is administered with a nonfat meal and approximately 4 - times higher when administered with a high - fat meal ( ~ 50 gm fat ) relative to the fasted state .
Following single - dose administration of Noxafil oral suspension 400 mg , the mean AUC and Cmax of posaconazole are approximately 3 - times higher when administered with a liquid nutritional supplement ( 14 gm fat ) relative to the fasted state ( see Table 24 ) .
In addition , the effects of varying gastric administration conditions on the Cmax and AUC of Noxafil oral suspension in healthy volunteers have been investigated and are shown in Table 25 .
In order to assure attainment of adequate plasma concentrations , it is recommended to administer Noxafil oral suspension during or immediately following a full meal .
In patients who cannot eat a full meal , Noxafil oral suspension should be taken with a liquid nutritional supplement or an acidic carbonated beverage ( e . g . , ginger ale ) .

It is recommended to closely monitor patients for breakthrough fungal infections when Noxafil is administered via an NG tube because a lower plasma exposure may be associated with an increased risk of treatment failure .
[ 2 ] Ratio Estimate is the ratio of coadministered drug plus Noxafil to coadministered drug alone for Cmax or AUC .
[ 3 ] NG = nasogastric Concomitant administration of Noxafil oral suspension with drugs affecting gastric pH or gastric motility results in lower posaconazole exposure .

[ 2 ] The tablet refers to a non - commercial tablet formulation without polymer .
[ 3 ] The drug interactions associated with the oral suspension are also relevant for the delayed - release tablet with the exception of Esomeprazole and Metoclopramide .
Distribution : The mean volume of distribution of posaconazole after intravenous solution administration was 261 L and ranged from 226 - 295 L between studies and dose levels .
Posaconazole is highly bound to human plasma proteins ( > 98 % ) , predominantly to albumin .
Metabolism : Posaconazole primarily circulates as the parent compound in plasma .
Of the circulating metabolites , the majority are glucuronide conjugates formed via UDP glucuronidation ( phase 2 enzymes ) .
Posaconazole does not have any major circulating oxidative ( CYP450 mediated ) metabolites .
The excreted metabolites in urine and feces account for ~ 17 % of the administered radiolabeled dose .
Posaconazole is primarily metabolized via UDP glucuronidation ( phase 2 enzymes ) and is a substrate for p - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) efflux .
Therefore , inhibitors or inducers of these clearance pathways may affect posaconazole plasma concentrations .
A summary of drugs studied clinically with the oral suspension or an early tablet formulation , which affect posaconazole concentrations , is provided in Table 27 .

[ 2 ] The tablet refers to a non - commercial tablet formulation without polymer .
In vitro studies with human hepatic microsomes and clinical studies indicate that posaconazole is an inhibitor primarily of CYP3A4 .
A clinical study in healthy volunteers also indicates that posaconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor as evidenced by a > 5 - fold increase in midazolam AUC .
Therefore , plasma concentrations of drugs predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 may be increased by posaconazole .
A summary of the drugs studied clinically , for which plasma concentrations were affected by posaconazole , is provided in Table 28 [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) including recommendations ] .

[ 2 ] The tablet refers to a non - commercial tablet formulation without polymer .
[ 3 ] The mean terminal half - life of midazolam was increased from 3 hours to 7 to 11 hours during coadministration with Noxafil .
Additional clinical studies demonstrated that no clinically significant effects on zidovudine , lamivudine , indinavir , or caffeine were observed when administered with Noxafil 200 mg once daily ; therefore , no dose adjustments are required for these coadministered drugs when coadministered with Noxafil 200 mg once daily .
Excretion : Following administration of Noxafil oral suspension , posaconazole is predominantly eliminated in the feces ( 71 % of the radiolabeled dose up to 120 hours ) with the major component eliminated as parent drug ( 66 % of the radiolabeled dose ) .
Renal clearance is a minor elimination pathway , with 13 % of the radiolabeled dose excreted in urine up to 120 hours ( < 0 . 2 % of the radiolabeled dose is parent drug ) .
Noxafil injection is eliminated with a mean terminal half - life ( t ½ ) of 27 hours and a total body clearance ( CL ) of 7 . 3 L / h .
Noxafil delayed - release tablet is eliminated with a mean half - life ( t ½ ) ranging between 26 to 31 hours .
Noxafil oral suspension is eliminated with a mean half - life ( t ½ ) of 35 hours ( range : 20 - 66 hours ) .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole were observed based on age , sex , renal impairment , and indication ( prophylaxis or treatment ) .
Race / Ethnicity : In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of posaconazole , AUC was found to be 25 % higher in Chinese patients relative to patients from other races / ethnicities .
This higher exposure is not expected to be clinically relevant given the expected variability in posaconazole exposure .
Patients Weighing More Than 120 kg : Weight has a clinically significant effect on posaconazole clearance .
Relative to 70 kg patients , the Cavg is decreased by 25 % in patients greater than 120 kg .
Patients administered Noxafil weighing more than 120 kg may be at higher risk for lower posaconazole plasma concentrations compared to lower weight patients [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 10 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients The mean pharmacokinetic parameters after multiple - dose administration of Noxafil injection and Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension in neutropenic pediatric patients 2 to less than 18 years of age are shown in Table 29 .
Patients were enrolled into 2 age groups and received Noxafil injection and Noxafil PowderMix for delayed - release oral suspension doses at 6 mg / kg ( 0 . 6 to 1 times the recommended dose ) with a maximum 300 mg dose once daily ( twice daily on Day 1 ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

The population pharmacokinetic analysis of posaconazole in pediatric patients suggests that age , sex , renal impairment and ethnicity have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole .
A total of 12 patients 13 to 17 years of age received 600 mg / day ( 200 mg three times a day ) of Noxafil oral suspension for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections .
Based on pharmacokinetic data in 10 of these pediatric patients , the mean steady - state Cav was similar between these patients and adults ( ≥ 18 years of age ) .
In a study of 136 neutropenic pediatric patients 11 months to less than 18 years treated with Noxafil oral suspension , the exposure target of steady - state posaconazole Cavg between 500 ng / mL and less than 2500 ng / mL was attained in approximately 50 % of patients instead of the pre - specified 90 % of patients .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action : Posaconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol , a key component of the fungal cell membrane , through the inhibition of cytochrome P - 450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14α - demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane .
This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane .
This may be responsible for the antifungal activity of posaconazole .
Resistance : Clinical isolates of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata with decreased susceptibility to posaconazole were observed in oral swish samples taken during prophylaxis with posaconazole and fluconazole , suggesting a potential for development of resistance .
These isolates also showed reduced susceptibility to other azoles , suggesting cross - resistance between azoles .
The clinical significance of this finding is not known .
Antimicrobial Activity : Posaconazole has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Microorganisms : Aspergillus spp .
and Candida spp .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No drug - related neoplasms were recorded in rats or mice treated with posaconazole for 2 years at doses higher than the clinical dose .
In a 2 - year carcinogenicity study , rats were given posaconazole orally at doses up to 20 mg / kg ( females ) , or 30 mg / kg ( males ) .
These doses are equivalent to 3 . 9 - or 3 . 5 - times the exposure achieved with a 400 - mg twice daily oral suspension regimen , respectively , based on steady - state AUC in healthy volunteers administered a high - fat meal ( 400 - mg twice daily oral suspension regimen ) .
In the mouse study , mice were treated at oral doses up to 60 mg / kg / day or 4 . 8 - times the exposure achieved with a 400 - mg twice daily oral suspension regimen .
Mutagenesis Posaconazole was not genotoxic or clastogenic when evaluated in bacterial mutagenicity ( Ames ) , a chromosome aberration study in human peripheral blood lymphocytes , a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutagenicity study , and a mouse bone marrow micronucleus study .
Impairment of Fertility Posaconazole had no effect on fertility of male rats at a dose up to 180 mg / kg ( 1 . 7 x the 400 - mg twice daily oral suspension regimen based on steady - state plasma concentrations in healthy volunteers ) or female rats at a dose up to 45 mg / kg ( 2 . 2 x the 400 - mg twice daily oral suspension regimen ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In a nonclinical study using intravenous administration of posaconazole in very young dogs ( dosed from 2 to 8 weeks of age ) , an increase in the incidence of brain ventricle enlargement was observed in treated animals as compared with concurrent control animals .
No difference in the incidence of brain ventricle enlargement between control and treated animals was observed following the subsequent 5 - month treatment - free period .
There were no neurologic , behavioral or developmental abnormalities in the dogs with this finding , and a similar brain finding was not seen with oral posaconazole administration to juvenile dogs ( 4 days to 9 months of age ) .
There were no drug - related increases in the incidence of brain ventricle enlargement when treated and control animals were compared in a separate study of 10 - week old dogs dosed with intravenous posaconazole for 13 weeks with a 9 - week recovery period or a follow - up study of 31 - week old dogs dosed for 3 months .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis with Noxafil Injection and Noxafil Delayed - Release Tablets Aspergillosis Treatment Study ( NCT01782131 ) was a randomized , double - blind , controlled trial which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Noxafil injection and Noxafil delayed - release tablets versus voriconazole for primary treatment of invasive fungal disease caused by Aspergillus species .
Eligible patients had proven , probable , or possible invasive fungal infections per the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer / Mycoses Study Group , EORTC / MSG criteria .
Patients were stratified by risk for mortality or poor outcome where high risk included a history of allogeneic bone marrow transplant , liver transplant , or relapsed leukemia undergoing salvage chemotherapy .
The median age of patients was 57 years ( range 14 - 91 years ) , with 27 . 8 % of patients aged ≥ 65 years ; 5 patients were pediatric patients 14 - 16 years of age , of whom 3 were treated with Noxafil and 2 with voriconazole .
The majority of patients were male ( 59 . 8 % ) and white ( 67 . 1 % ) .
With regard to risk factors for invasive aspergillosis , approximately two - thirds of the patients in the study had a recent history of neutropenia , while approximately 20 % with a history of an allogeneic stem cell transplant .
Over 80 % of subjects in each treatment group had infection limited to the lower respiratory tract ( primarily lung ) , while approximately 11 % to 13 % also had infection in another organ .
Invasive aspergillosis was proven or probable in 58 . 1 % of patients as classified by independent adjudicators blinded to study treatment assignment .
At least one Aspergillus species was identified in 21 % of the patients ; A . fumigatus and A . flavus were the most common pathogens identified .
Patients randomized to receive Noxafil were given a dose of 300 mg once daily ( twice daily on Day 1 ) IV or tablet .
Patients randomized to receive voriconazole were given a dose of 6 mg / kg twice daily Day 1 followed by 4 mg / kg twice daily IV , or oral 300 mg twice daily Day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily .
The recommended initial route of administration was IV ; however , patients could begin oral therapy if clinically stable and able to tolerate oral dosing .
The transition from IV to oral therapy occurred when the patient was clinically stable .
The protocol recommended duration of therapy was 84 days with a maximum allowed duration of 98 days .
Median treatment duration was 67 days for Noxafil patients and 64 days for voriconazole patients .
Overall , 55 % to 60 % of patients began treatment with the IV formulation with a median duration of 9 days for the initial IV dosing .
The Intent to Treat ( ITT ) population included all patients randomized and receiving at least one dose of study treatment .
All - cause mortality through Day 42 in the overall population ( ITT ) was 15 . 3 % for Noxafil patients compared to 20 . 6 % for voriconazole patients for an adjusted treatment difference of - 5 . 3 % with a 95 % confidence interval of - 11 . 6 to 1 . 0 % .
Consistent results were seen in patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis per EORTC criteria ( see Table 30 ) .

14 . 2 Prophylaxis of Aspergillus and Candida Infections with Noxafil Oral Suspension Two randomized , controlled studies were conducted using Noxafil as prophylaxis for the prevention of invasive fungal infections ( IFIs ) among patients at high risk due to severely compromised immune systems .
The first study ( Noxafil Oral Suspension Study 1 ) was a randomized , double - blind trial that compared Noxafil oral suspension ( 200 mg three times a day ) with fluconazole capsules ( 400 mg once daily ) as prophylaxis against invasive fungal infections in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) recipients with Graft versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) .
Efficacy of prophylaxis was evaluated using a composite endpoint of proven / probable IFIs , death , or treatment with systemic antifungal therapy ( patients may have met more than one of these criteria ) .
This assessed all patients while on study therapy plus 7 days and at 16 weeks post - randomization .
The mean duration of therapy was comparable between the 2 treatment groups ( 80 days , Noxafil oral suspension ; 77 days , fluconazole ) .
Table 32 contains the results from Noxafil Oral Suspension Study 1 .

These patients were considered failures .
The second study ( Noxafil Oral Suspension Study 2 ) was a randomized , open - label study that compared Noxafil oral suspension ( 200 mg 3 times a day ) with fluconazole suspension ( 400 mg once daily ) or itraconazole oral solution ( 200 mg twice a day ) as prophylaxis against IFIs in neutropenic patients who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for AML or MDS .
As in Noxafil Oral Suspension Study 1 , efficacy of prophylaxis was evaluated using a composite endpoint of proven / probable IFIs , death , or treatment with systemic antifungal therapy ( Patients might have met more than one of these criteria ) .
This study assessed patients while on treatment plus 7 days and 100 days postrandomization .
The mean duration of therapy was comparable between the 2 treatment groups ( 29 days , posaconazole ; 25 days , fluconazole or itraconazole ) .
Table 33 contains the results from Noxafil Oral Suspension Study 2 .

[ 2 ] Patients may have met more than one criterion defining failure .
[ 3 ] Use of systemic antifungal therapy ( SAF ) criterion is based on protocol definitions ( empiric / IFI usage > 3 consecutive days ) .
[ 4 ] Patients who are lost to follow - up ( not observed for 100 days ) , and who did not meet another clinical failure endpoint .
These patients were considered failures .
In summary , 2 clinical studies of prophylaxis were conducted with the Noxafil oral suspension .
As seen in the accompanying tables ( Tables 32 and 33 ) , clinical failure represented a composite endpoint of breakthrough IFI , mortality and use of systemic antifungal therapy .
In Noxafil Oral Suspension Study 1 ( Table 32 ) , the clinical failure rate of posaconazole ( 33 % ) was similar to fluconazole ( 37 % ) , ( 95 % CI for the difference posaconazole – comparator - 11 . 5 % to 3 . 7 % ) while in Noxafil Oral Suspension Study 2 ( Table 33 ) clinical failure was lower for patients treated with posaconazole ( 27 % ) when compared to patients treated with fluconazole or itraconazole ( 42 % ) , ( 95 % CI for the difference posaconazole – comparator - 22 . 9 % to - 7 . 8 % ) .
All - cause mortality was similar at 16 weeks for both treatment arms in Noxafil Oral Suspension Study 1 [ POS 58 / 301 ( 19 % ) vs . FLU 59 / 299 ( 20 % ) ] ; all - cause mortality was lower at 100 days for Noxafil - treated patients in Noxafil Oral Suspension Study 2 [ POS 44 / 304 ( 14 % ) vs . FLU / ITZ 64 / 298 ( 21 % ) ] .
Both studies demonstrated fewer breakthrough infections caused by Aspergillus species in patients receiving Noxafil prophylaxis when compared to patients receiving fluconazole or itraconazole .
14 . 3 Treatment of Oropharyngeal Candidiasis with Noxafil Oral Suspension Noxafil Oral Suspension Study 3 was a randomized , controlled , evaluator - blinded study in HIV - infected patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis .
Patients were treated with Noxafil or fluconazole oral suspension ( both Noxafil and fluconazole were given as follows : 100 mg twice a day for 1 day followed by 100 mg once a day for 13 days ) .
Clinical and mycological outcomes were assessed after 14 days of treatment and at 4 weeks after the end of treatment .
Patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had a positive oral swish culture of Candida species at baseline were included in the analyses ( see Table 34 ) .
The majority of the subjects had C . albicans as the baseline pathogen .
Clinical success at Day 14 ( complete or partial resolution of all ulcers and / or plaques and symptoms ) and clinical relapse rates ( recurrence of signs or symptoms after initial cure or improvement ) 4 weeks after the end of treatment were similar between the treatment arms ( see Table 34 ) .
Mycologic eradication rates ( absence of colony forming units in quantitative culture at the end of therapy , Day 14 ) , as well as mycologic relapse rates ( 4 weeks after the end of treatment ) were also similar between the treatment arms ( see Table 34 ) .
Table 34 : Noxafil Oral Suspension Clinical Success , Mycological Eradication , and Relapse Rates in Oropharyngeal Candidiasis Noxafil Fluconazole Clinical Success at End of Therapy ( Day 14 ) 155 / 169 ( 91 . 7 % ) 148 / 160 ( 92 . 5 % ) Clinical Relapse ( 4 Weeks after End of Therapy ) 45 / 155 ( 29 . 0 % ) 52 / 148 ( 35 . 1 % ) Mycological Eradication ( absence of CFU ) at End of Therapy ( Day 14 ) 88 / 169 ( 52 . 1 % ) 80 / 160 ( 50 . 0 % ) Mycological Relapse ( 4 Weeks after End of Treatment ) 49 / 88 ( 55 . 6 % ) 51 / 80 ( 63 . 7 % ) Mycologic response rates , using a criterion for success as a posttreatment quantitative culture with ≤ 20 colony forming units ( CFU / mL ) were also similar between the two groups ( Noxafil 68 . 0 % , fluconazole 68 . 1 % ) .
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown .
14 . 4 Noxafil Oral Suspension Treatment of Oropharyngeal Candidiasis Refractory to Treatment with Fluconazole or Itraconazole Noxafil Oral Suspension Study 4 was a noncomparative study of Noxafil oral suspension in HIV - infected subjects with OPC that was refractory to treatment with fluconazole or itraconazole .
