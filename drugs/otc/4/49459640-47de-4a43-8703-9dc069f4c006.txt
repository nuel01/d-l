[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Rx only WARNING : PERIPHERAL ISCHEMIA FOLLOWING COADMINISTRATION WITH POTENT CYP3A4 INHIBITORS Serious and / or life - threatening peripheral ischemia has been associated with the coadministration of dihydroergotamine with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors including protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics .
Because CYP3A4 inhibition elevates the serum levels of dihydroergotamine , the risk for vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemia and / or ischemia of the extremities is increased .
Hence , concomitant use of these medications is contraindicated ( see also CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ) .
DESCRIPTION Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP is ergotamine hydrogenated in the 9 , 10 position as the mesylate salt .
Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP is known chemically as ergotaman - 3 ´ , 6 ´ , 18 - trione , 9 , 10 - dihydro - 12 ´ - hydroxy - 2 ´ - methyl - 5 ´ - ( phenylmethyl ) - , ( 5 ´ α ) - , monomethanesulfonate .
Its molecular weight is 679 . 80 and its empirical formula is C33H37N5O5 • CH4O3S .
The chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Dihydroergotamine mesylate C33H37N5O5 • CH4O3S Mol .
Wt .
679 . 80 Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP is a clear , colorless solution supplied in sterile ampules for intravenous , intramuscular , or subcutaneous administration .
Each mL contains 1 mg Dihydroergotamine Mesylate , USP ; Alcohol , USP 6 . 1 % by volume ; Glycerin , USP 15 % by weight ; Water for Injection , USP ; Methanesulfonic Acid and / or Sodium Hydroxide for pH adjustment ( pH range is 3 . 4 to 4 . 9 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Dihydroergotamine binds with high affinity to 5 - HT1Dα and 5 - HT1Dβ receptors .
It also binds with high affinity to serotonin 5 - HT1A , 5 - HT2A , and 5 - HT2C receptors , noradrenaline α2A , α2B and α1 receptors , and dopamine D2L and D3 receptors .
The therapeutic activity of dihydroergotamine in migraine is generally attributed to the agonist effect at 5 - HT1D receptors .
Two current theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5 - HT1D receptor agonists in migraine .
One theory suggests that activation of 5 - HT1D receptors located on intracranial blood vessels , including those on arteriovenous anastomoses , leads to vasoconstriction , which correlates with the relief of migraine headache .
The alternative hypothesis suggests that activation of 5 - HT1D receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro - inflammatory neuropeptide release .
In addition , dihydroergotamine possesses oxytocic properties .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption Absolute bioavailability for the subcutaneous and intramuscular route have not been determined ; however , no difference was observed in dihydroergotamine bioavailability from intramuscular and subcutaneous doses .
Dihydroergotamine mesylate is poorly bioavailable following oral administration .
Distribution Dihydroergotamine mesylate is 93 % plasma protein bound .
The apparent steady - state volume of distribution is approximately 800 liters .
Metabolism Four dihydroergotamine mesylate metabolites have been identified in human plasma following oral administration .
The major metabolite , 8 ´ - β - hydroxydihydroergotamine , exhibits affinity equivalent to its parent for adrenergic and 5 - HT receptors and demonstrates equivalent potency in several venoconstrictor activity models , in vivo and in vitro .
The other metabolites , ( i . e . , dihydrolysergic acid , dihydrolysergic amide ) and a metabolite formed by oxidative opening of the proline ring are of minor importance .
Following nasal administration , total metabolites represent only 20 % to 30 % of plasma AUC .
Quantitative pharmacokinetic characterization of the four metabolites has not been performed .
Excretion The major excretory route of dihydroergotamine is via the bile in the feces .
The total body clearance is 1 . 5 L / min which reflects mainly hepatic clearance .
Only 6 % to 7 % of unchanged dihydroergotamine is excreted in the urine after intramuscular injection .
The renal clearance ( 0 . 1 L / min ) is unaffected by the route of dihydroergotamine administration .
The decline of plasma dihydroergotamine after intramuscular or intravenous administration is multi - exponential with a terminal half - life of about 9 hours .
Subpopulations No studies have been conducted on the effect of renal or hepatic impairment , gender , race , or ethnicity on dihydroergotamine pharmacokinetics .
Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP is contraindicated in patients with severely impaired hepatic or renal function ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Interactions Pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported in patients treated orally with other ergot alkaloids ( e . g . , increased levels of ergotamine ) and macrolide antibiotics , principally troleandomycin , presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P4503A metabolism of the alkaloids by troleandomycin .
Dihydroergotamine has also been shown to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P4503A catalyzed reactions and rare reports of ergotism have been obtained from patients treated with dihydroergotamine and macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , troleandomycin , clarithromycin , erythromycin ) , and in patients treated with dihydroergotamine and protease inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir ) , presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P4503A metabolism of ergotamine ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
No pharmacokinetic interactions involving other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are known .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes .
CONTRAINDICATIONS There have been a few reports of serious adverse events associated with the coadministration of dihydroergotamine and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors , such as protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics , resulting in vasospasm that led to cerebral ischemia and / or ischemia of the extremities .
The use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ( i . e . , ritonavir , nelfinavir , indinavir , erythromycin , clarithromycin , troleandomycin , ketoconazole , itraconazole ) with dihydroergotamine is , therefore , contraindicated ( see WARNINGS , CYP3A4 Inhibitors ) .
Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP should not be given to patients with ischemic heart disease ( e . g . , angina pectoris , history of myocardial infarction , or documented silent ischemia ) or to patients who have clinical symptoms or findings consistent with coronary artery vasospasm including Prinzmetal ' s variant angina ( see WARNINGS ) .
Because Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP may increase blood pressure , it should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension .
Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP , 5 - HT1 agonists ( e . g . , sumatriptan ) , ergotamine - containing or ergot - type medications or methysergide should not be used within 24 hours of each other .
Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine .
In addition to those conditions mentioned above , Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP is also contraindicated in patients with known peripheral arterial disease , sepsis , following vascular surgery and severely impaired hepatic or renal function .
Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP is contraindicated in patients who have previously shown hypersensitivity to ergot alkaloids .
Dihydroergotamine mesylate should not be used with peripheral and central vasoconstrictors because the combination may result in additive or synergistic elevation of blood pressure .
WARNINGS Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established .
CYP3A4 Inhibitors ( e . g . , Macrolide Antibiotics and Protease Inhibitors ) There have been rare reports of serious adverse events in connection with the coadministration of dihydroergotamine and potent CYPA4 inhibitors , such as protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics , resulting in vasospasm that led to cerebral ischemia and / or and ischemia of the extremities .
The use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with dihydroergotamine should therefore be avoided ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Examples of some of the more potent CYP3A4 inhibitors include : antifungals ketoconazole and itraconazole , the protease inhibitors ritonavir , nelfinavir , and indinavir , and macrolide antibiotics erythromycin , clarithromycin , and troleandomycin .
Other less potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be administered with caution .
Less potent inhibitors include saquinavir , nefazodone , fluconazole , grapefruit juice , fluoxetine , fluvoxamine , zileuton , and clotrimazole .
These lists are not exhaustive , and the prescriber should consider the effects on CYP3A4 of other agents being considered for concomitant use with dihydroergotamine .
Fibrotic Complications There have been reports of pleural and retroperitoneal fibrosis in patients following prolonged daily use of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate .
Rarely , prolonged daily use of other ergot alkaloid drugs has been associated with cardiac valvular fibrosis .
Rare cases have also been reported in association with the use of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate ; however , in those cases , patients also received drugs known to be associated with cardiac valvular fibrosis .
Administration of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP , should not exceed the dosing guidelines and should not be used for chronic daily administration ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and / or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP should not be used by patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
It is strongly recommended that Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP not be given to patients in whom unrecognized coronary artery disease ( CAD ) is predicted by the presence of risk factors ( e . g . , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , smoker , obesity , diabetes , strong family history of CAD , females who are surgically or physiologically postmenopausal , or males who are over 40 years of age ) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease .
The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest , at best .
If , during the cardiovascular evaluation , the patient ' s medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of or consistent with coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia , Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP should not be administered ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation , it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP take place in the setting of a physician ' s office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received dihydroergotamine mesylate .
Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms , consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use , an electrocardiogram ( ECG ) during the interval immediately following Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP in those patients with risk factors .
It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long - term users of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD , as described above , undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP .
The systematic approach described above is currently recommended as a method to identify patients in whom Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP may be used to treat migraine headaches with an acceptable margin of cardiovascular safety .
Cardiac Events and Fatalities The potential for adverse cardiac events exists .
Serious adverse cardiac events , including acute myocardial infarction , life - threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm , and death have been reported to have occurred following the administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate injection .
Considering the extent of use of dihydroergotamine mesylate in patients with migraine , the incidence of these events is extremely low .
Drug - Associated Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities Cerebral hemorrhage , subarachnoid hemorrhage , stroke , and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP ; and some have resulted in fatalities .
In a number of cases , it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary , the Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine , when they were not .
It should be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events ( e . g . , stroke , hemorrhage , transient ischemic attack ) .
Other Vasospasm - Related Events Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP , like other ergot alkaloids , may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm .
Myocardial , peripheral vascular , and colonic ischemia have been reported with Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP .
Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP associated vasospastic phenomena may also cause muscle pains , numbness , coldness , pallor , and cyanosis of the digits .
In patients with compromised circulation , persistent vasospasm may result in gangrene or death .
Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of vasoconstriction develop .
Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension treated with dihydroergotamine mesylate injection .
Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
An 18 % increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure was seen following dosing with another 5 - HT1 agonist in a study evaluating subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization .
Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs ( e . g . , ergotamines , triptans , opioids , or a combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month ) may lead to exacerbation of headache ( i . e . , medication overuse headache ) .
Medication overuse headache may present as migraine - like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks .
Detoxification of patients including withdrawal of the overused drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms ( which often includes a transient worsening of headache ) may be necessary .
Preterm Labor Based on the mechanism of action of dihydroergotamine and findings from the published literature , Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP may cause preterm labor .
Avoid use of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP during pregnancy ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
PRECAUTIONS General Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP may cause coronary artery vasospasm ; patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following its administration should , therefore , be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to variant angina before receiving additional doses .
Similarly , patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow , such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud ' s syndrome following the use of any 5 - HT agonist are candidates for further evaluation ( see WARNINGS ) .

Prior to the initial use of the product by a patient , the prescriber should take steps to ensure that the patient understands how to use the product as provided ( see Patient Information Sheet and product packaging ) .
Administration of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP should not exceed the dosing guidelines and should not be used for chronic daily administration ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Drug Interactions Vasoconstrictors Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP should not be used with peripheral vasoconstrictors because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure .
Sumatriptan Sumatriptan has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm , and its effect could be additive with Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP .
Sumatriptan and Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Beta Blockers Although the results of a clinical study did not indicate a safety problem associated with the administration of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP to subjects already receiving propranolol , there have been reports that propranolol may potentiate the vasoconstrictive action of ergotamine by blocking the vasodilating property of epinephrine .
Nicotine Nicotine may provoke vasoconstriction in some patients , predisposing to a greater ischemic response to ergot therapy .
CYP3A4 Inhibitors ( e . g . , Macrolide Antibiotics and Protease Inhibitors ) ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ) SSRI ' s Weakness , hyperreflexia , and incoordination have been reported rarely when 5 - HT1 agonists have been co - administered with SSRI ' s ( e . g . , fluoxetine , fluvoxamine , paroxetine , sertraline ) .
There have been no reported cases from spontaneous reports of drug interaction between SSRI ' s and Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP .
Oral Contraceptives The effect of oral contraceptives on the pharmacokinetics of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP has not been studied .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2 - year mouse carcinogenicity study , subcutaneous ( SC ) administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate ( 0 , 0 . 5 , 1 . 5 or 5 mg / kg / day ) resulted in an increased incidence of fibrosarcoma at the injection sites in males and females at the high dose .
The higher dose not associated with an increase in tumors ( 1 . 5 mg / kg / day ) is approximately 2 times the recommended human dose ( RHD ) of 3 mg / day SC on a body surface area ( mg / m2 ) basis .
In a 2 - year rat carcinogenicity study , intranasal administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate ( 0 , 0 . 4 , 0 . 8 or 1 . 6 mg / day for 13 weeks , followed by 0 , 0 . 08 , 0 . 24 or 0 . 8 mg / day for the remainder of the study ) did not result in an increase in tumors .
Mutagenesis Dihydroergotamine mesylate was clastogenic in two in vitro chromosomal aberration assays , the V79 Chinese hamster cell assay with metabolic activation and the cultured human peripheral blood lymphocyte assay .
There was no evidence of mutagenic potential when dihydroergotamine mesylate was tested in the presence or absence of metabolic activation in two gene mutation assays ( the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79 / HGPRT assay ) and in an assay for DNA damage ( the rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis test ) .
Dihydroergotamine was not clastogenic in the in vivo mouse and hamster micronucleus tests .
Impairment of Fertility Intranasal administration of dihydroergotamine to rats at doses up to 1 . 6 mg / day was not associated with adverse effects on fertility .
Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature indicated an increased risk of preterm delivery with Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP use during pregnancy .
Avoid use of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP during pregnancy ( see WARNINGS ) .
Data collected over decades have shown no increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage with the use of dihydroergotamine mesylate during pregnancy .
In animal reproduction studies , adverse effects on development were observed following intranasal administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate during pregnancy ( decreased fetal body weight and / or skeletal ossification ) in rats and rabbits or during pregnancy and lactation in rats ( decreased body weight and impaired reproductive function in the offspring ) at doses that were not associated with maternal toxicity ( see Data ) .
The estimated rate of major birth defects ( 2 . 2 % to 2 . 9 % ) and miscarriage ( 17 % ) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Intranasal administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate to pregnant rats throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weight and / or skeletal ossification at doses of 0 . 16 mg / day and greater .
A no - effect level for adverse effects on embryofetal development was not identified in rats .
Intranasal administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in decreased skeletal ossification of 3 . 6 mg / day .
The no - effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits was 1 . 2 mg / day .
Intranasal administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in decreased body weight and impaired reproductive function ( decreased mating indices ) in the offspring at doses of 0 . 16 mg / day or greater .
A no - effect dose for adverse effects on pre - and postnatal development in rats was not established .
Effects on offspring development occurred at doses below those that produced evidence of maternal toxicity in these studies .
Dihydroergotamine - induced intrauterine growth retardation has been attributed to reduced uteroplacental blood flow resulting from prolonged vasoconstriction of the uterine vessels and / or increased myometrial tone .
Nursing Mothers Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of dihydroergotamine in human milk ; however , ergotamine , a related drug , is present in human milk .
There are reports of vomiting , diarrhea , weak pulse , and unstable blood pressure in breastfed infants exposed to ergotamine .
Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Injection , USP may reduce milk supply because it may decrease prolactin levels .
