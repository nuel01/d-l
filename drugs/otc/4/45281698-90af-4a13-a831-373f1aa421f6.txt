6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Acute and Chronic Hyperammonemia due to NAGS Deficiency In a retrospective case series of 23 NAGS deficiency patients treated with CARBAGLU , 17 of the 23 patients reported any adverse reaction .
The most common adverse reactions ( occurring in ≥ 13 % of patients ) were vomiting , abdominal pain , pyrexia , tonsillitis , anemia , diarrhea , ear infection , infections , nasopharyngitis , hemoglobin decreased , and headache .
Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions occurring in 2 or more patients with NAGS deficiency treated with CARBAGLU in the retrospective case series ( ≥ 9 % ) .

The average patient age ( SD ) was 9 . 2 years ( 7 . 7 ) and 12 ( 50 % ) were males .
CARBAGLU was administered at a dosage of 150 mg / kg / day for patients ≤ 15 kg or 3 . 3 g / m2 / day for patients > 15 kg , divided into 2 doses , for a median duration of 4 . 14 days .
At least 1 adverse reaction was reported during the course of hyperammonemic episodes in 42 . 2 % of hyperammonemic episodes .
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % ) during hyperammonemic episodes were neutropenia , anemia , vomiting , electrolyte imbalance , decreased appetite , hypoglycemia , lethargy / stupor , encephalopathy and pancreatitis / lipase increased .
Table 2 summarizes adverse reactions ( ≥ 2 % ) during hyperammonemic episodes in patients with PA or MMA treated with CARBAGLU or placebo .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Psychiatric disorders : mania Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : pruritus , rash including rash erythematous , rash maculopapular , rash pustular 8 .
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women with NAGS deficiency exposed to CARBAGLU .
If CARBAGLU is administered during pregnancy , health care providers should report CARBAGLU exposure by calling 1 - 888 - 575 - 8344 .
Risk Summary Although rare case reports of CARBAGLU use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes , untreated NAGS deficiency , PA and MMA can result in irreversible neurologic damage and death in pregnant women [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
In an animal reproduction study , decreased survival and growth occurred in offspring born to rats that received carglumic acid at a dose approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , miscarriage , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Pregnant women with urea cycle disorders , PA , and MMA may experience an increase in catabolic stress which can trigger a hyperammonemic crisis both in the intrapartum and in the post - partum ( 3 - 14 days post - partum ) periods .
Maternal complications related to hyperammonemic crisis can include neurological impairment , coma and in some cases death .
Data Animal Data No effects on embryo - fetal development were observed in pregnant rats treated with up to 2000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [ 100 mg / kg / day ] based on AUC [ area under the plasma concentration - time curve ] ) from two weeks prior to mating through organogenesis or in pregnant rabbits treated with up to 1000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 6 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [ 100 mg / kg / day ] based on AUC ) during organogenesis .
In a pre - and post - natal developmental study , female rats received oral carglumic acid from organogenesis through lactation at doses of 500 mg / kg / day and 2000 mg / kg / day .
Decreased growth of offspring was observed at 500 mg / kg / day and higher ( approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [ 100 mg / kg / day ] based on AUC ) , and reduction in offspring survival during lactation was observed at 2000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [ 100 mg / kg / day ] based on AUC ) .
No effects on physical and sexual development , learning and memory , or reproductive performance were observed through maturation of the surviving offspring at maternal doses up to 2000 mg / kg / day .
The high dose ( 2000 mg / kg / day ) produced maternal toxicity ( impaired weight gain and approximately 10 % mortality ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether carglumic acid is present in human milk .
There are no available data on the effects of carglumic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Carglumic acid is present in milk from treated rats .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for CARBAGLU and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CARBAGLU or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CARBAGLU for the treatment of pediatric patients ( birth to 17 years of age ) with acute or chronic hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency and acute hyperammonemia due to PA or MMA have been established , and the information on these uses are discussed throughout the labeling .
There are insufficient data to determine if there is a difference in clinical or biochemical responses between adult and pediatric patients treated with CARBAGLU .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of CARBAGLU did not include patients 65 years of age and older .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Plasma concentrations of carglumic acid increased in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Reduce the CARBAGLU dosage in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid have not been evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease .
10 .
OVERDOSAGE One patient treated with 650 mg / kg / day of CARBAGLU developed symptoms resembling monosodium glutamate intoxication - like syndrome and characterized by tachycardia , profuse sweating , increased bronchial secretions , increased body temperature , and restlessness .
These symptoms resolved upon reduction of the dose .
11 .
DESCRIPTION CARBAGLU tablets for oral suspension contain 200 mg of carglumic acid .
Carglumic acid , the active substance , is a carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 ( CPS 1 ) activator and is soluble in boiling water , slightly soluble in cold water , and practically insoluble in organic solvents .
Chemically , carglumic acid is N - carbamoyl - L - glutamic acid or ( 2 S ) - 2 - ( carbamoylamino ) pentanedioic acid , with a molecular weight of 190 . 16 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Formula : C6H10N2O5 The inactive ingredients of CARBAGLU are croscarmellose sodium , hypromellose , microcrystalline cellulose , silica colloidal anhydrous , sodium lauryl sulfate , and sodium stearyl fumarate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Carglumic acid is a synthetic structural analogue of N - acetylglutamate ( NAG ) which is produced from glutamate and acetyl - CoA in a reaction catalyzed by N ‑ acetylglutamate synthase ( NAGS ) , a mitochondrial liver enzyme .
NAG acts as the essential allosteric activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 ( CPS 1 ) , a mitochondrial liver enzyme which catalyzes the first reaction of the urea cycle .
The urea cycle , whose role is the disposition of ammonia , includes a series of biochemical reactions in the liver resulting in the conversion of ammonia into urea , which is then excreted through the urine .
Carglumic acid acts as a CPS1 activator , improves or restores the function of the urea cycle , and facilitates ammonia detoxification and urea production .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a retrospective review of the clinical course in 23 patients with NAGS deficiency , carglumic acid reduced plasma ammonia levels within 24 hours when administered with and without concomitant ammonia lowering therapies .
No dose - response relationship has been identified .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of carglumic acid was evaluated in a Phase 1 , randomized study in 76 healthy volunteers .
The study suggests a lack of clinically relevant QT prolongation effect at the highest therapeutic dose level ( 250 mg / kg / day ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid in healthy subjects following an intravenous ( IV ) infusion over 2 hours at 8 mg / kg or an oral administration at 100 mg / kg are summarized in Table 3 .

Distribution Carglumic acid is not bound to plasma proteins .
Elimination Carglumic acid is predominantly excreted by the kidneys as unchanged product .
Metabolism A proportion of carglumic acid may be metabolized by the intestinal bacterial flora .
The likely end product of carglumic acid metabolism is carbon dioxide , eliminated through the lungs .
Excretion Following an oral administration of radiolabeled CARBAGLU at 100 mg / kg , 9 % of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine and up to 60 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the feces .
Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid in subjects with renal impairment were compared with healthy subjects with normal renal function following oral administration of a single dose of CARBAGLU 40 mg / kg or 80 mg / kg .
The Cmax and AUC0 - t of carglumic acid are summarized in Table 4 .
The geometric mean ratio ( 90 % CI ) of AUC0 - t in subjects with mild , moderate , and severe renal impairment relative to those in their matched control subjects with normal renal function were approximately 1 . 3 ( 1 . 01 , 1 . 68 ) , 2 . 0 ( 1 . 65 , 2 . 54 ) , and 4 . 6 ( 3 . 36 , 6 . 34 ) respectively [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .

CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Acute and Chronic Hyperammonemia due to NAGS Deficiency The efficacy of CARBAGLU in the treatment of acute and chronic hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency was evaluated in a retrospective case series of 23 NAGS deficiency patients treated with CARBAGLU over a median duration of 7 . 9 years ( range 0 . 6 to 20 . 8 years ) .
For acute treatment , patients received CARBAGLU at 100 mg / kg / day to 250 mg / kg / day primarily administered in 2 to 4 divided doses .
For maintenance treatment , the dosage was reduced over time based on plasma ammonia level and clinical response .
The baseline characteristics of the patient population are shown in Table 5 .

Short - term efficacy was evaluated using mean and median change in plasma ammonia levels from baseline to days 1 to 3 .
Persistence of the effect was evaluated using long - term mean and median change in plasma ammonia level .
Of the 23 NAGS deficiency patients in the case series , 13 patients had documented plasma ammonia levels prior to CARBAGLU treatment and after long - term treatment with CARBAGLU and were evaluable .
Table 5 summarizes the plasma ammonia levels at baseline , days 1 to 3 post - CARBAGLU treatment , and long - term CARBAGLU treatment ( mean 8 years ) in the 13 evaluable patients .
All 13 patients had increased plasma ammonia levels at baseline ( mean 271 micromol / L ; normal range : 5 to 50 micromol / L ) .
By day 3 and with long - term treatment , normal plasma ammonia levels were attained ( Table 6 ) .

Eligible hyperammonemic episodes , defined as an admission to the hospital with a plasma ammonia level ≥ 70 micromol / L , were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either CARBAGLU or placebo for 7 days or until hospital discharge , whichever occurred earlier .
All patients received standard of care , including a combination of protein restriction , intravenous glucose , insulin , and / or L - carnitine ; the use of alternative pathway medications ( e . g . , sodium benzoate and medications with phenylacetate as an active metabolite ) was prohibited .
CARBAGLU was dosed at 150 mg / kg / day for patients ≤ 15 kg or 3 . 3 g / m2 / day for patients > 15 kg and was divided into 2 equal doses administered 12 hours apart by NG tube , G - tube , or oral syringe .
Plasma ammonia testing was performed at pre - randomization and at post - dosing intervals of every 6 - 12 hours for the first 48 hours and every day thereafter if the ammonia level was ≥ 50 micromol / L .
The efficacy evaluation was based on 90 hyperammonemic episodes ( 42 treated with CARBAGLU and 48 with placebo ) in 24 patients ( 12 male and 12 female ) with PA ( n = 15 ) or MMA ( n = 9 ) .
The median patient age was 8 years ( range 4 days to 29 years ) .
The primary endpoint was the time from the first dose of drug to the earlier of plasma ammonia level ≤ 50 micromol / L ( normal range ) or hospital discharge .
The median time to reach the primary endpoint was 1 . 5 days in the CARBAGLU group compared to 2 . 0 days in the placebo group , a difference of 0 . 5 days ( 95 % confidence interval : - 1 . 2 , 0 . 1 ) , driven exclusively by an effect on plasma ammonia normalization .
Throughout the first three days of treatment , a higher proportion of CARBAGLU - treated episodes reached the primary endpoint compared to placebo - treated episodes ( Figure 2 ) .
