6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In clinical trials , 769 subjects received at least 1 dose of cyclosporine ophthalmic solution .
The majority of the treated subjects were female ( 83 % ) .
The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than 5 % of subjects were pain on instillation of drops ( 22 % ) and conjunctival hyperemia ( 6 % ) .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of CEQUA administration in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk .
Oral administration of cyclosporine to pregnant rats or rabbits did not produce teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses [ see Data ] .
Data Animal Data Oral administration of cyclosporine oral solution ( USP ) to pregnant rats or rabbits was teratogenic at maternally toxic doses of 30 mg / kg / day in rats and 100 mg / kg / day in rabbits , as indicated by increased pre - and postnatal mortality , reduced fetal weight and skeletal retardations .
These doses ( normalized to body weight ) were approximately 3200 and 21000 times higher than the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose ( MRHOD ) of 1 . 5 mcg / kg / day , respectively .
No adverse embryofetal effects were observed in rats or rabbits receiving cyclosporine during organogenesis at oral doses up to 17 mg / kg / day or 30 mg / kg / day , respectively ( approximately 1800 and 6400 times higher than the MRHOD , respectively ) .
An oral dose of 45 mg / kg / day cyclosporine ( approximately 4800 times higher than MRHOD ) administered to rats from Day 15 of pregnancy until Day 21 postpartum produced maternal toxicity and an increase in postnatal mortality in offspring .
No adverse effects in dams or offspring were observed at oral doses up to 15 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1600 times greater than the MRHOD ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Cyclosporine blood concentrations are low following topical ocular administration of CEQUA [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
There is no information regarding the presence of cyclosporine in human milk following topical administration or on the effects of CEQUA on the breastfed infants and milk production .
Administration of oral cyclosporine to rats during lactation did not produce adverse effects in offspring at clinically relevant doses [ see Pregnancy ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for CEQUA and any potential adverse effects on the breast - fed child from cyclosporine .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of CEQUA ophthalmic solution have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18 .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger adult patients .
11 DESCRIPTION CEQUA ( cyclosporine ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 09 % contains a topical calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant .
Cyclosporine ’ s chemical name is Cyclo [ [ ( E ) - ( 2 S , 3 R , 4 R ) - 3 - hydroxy - 4 - methyl - 2 - ( methylamino ) - 6 - octenoyl ] - L - 2 - aminobutyryl - N - methylglycyl - N - methyl - L - leucyl - L - valyl - N - methyl - L - leucyl - L - alanyl - D - alanyl - N - methyl - L - leucyl - N - methyl - L - leucyl - N - methyl - L - valyl ] and it has the following structure : Structural Formula [ MULTIMEDIA ] Formula : C62H111N11O12 Mol .
Wt . : 1202 . 6 Cyclosporine is a white powder that is insoluble in water .
CEQUA is supplied as a sterile , clear , colorless ophthalmic solution for topical ophthalmic use .
It has an osmolality of 160 to 190 mOsmol / kg and a pH of 6 . 5 - 7 . 2 .
Each mL of CEQUA contains : • Active : cyclosporine 0 . 09 % • Inactives : Polyoxyl 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil , Octoxynol - 40 , polyvinylpyrrolidone , sodium phosphate monobasic dihydrate , sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous , sodium chloride , water for injection , and sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to adjust pH . [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant agent when administered systemically .
In patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca , topical administration of cyclosporine is thought to act as a partial immunomodulator .
The exact mechanism of action is not known .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Blood concentrations of cyclosporine after twice daily topical ocular administration of CEQUA into each eye of healthy subjects for up to 7 days , and once on Day 8 , were either not detectable or were marginally above the lower limit of assay quantitation of 0 . 100 ng / mL ( range 0 . 101 to 0 . 195 ng / mL ) for up to 2 hours after a single dose , and up to 4 hours after multiple doses .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Systemic carcinogenicity studies were carried out in male and female mice and rats .
In the 78 week oral ( diet ) mouse study , at doses of 1 , 4 , and 16 mg / kg / day , evidence of a statistically significant trend was found for lymphocytic lymphomas in females , and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in mid - dose males significantly exceeded the control value .
In the 24 - month oral ( diet ) rat study , conducted at 0 . 5 , 2 , and 8 mg / kg / day , pancreatic islet cell adenomas significantly exceeded the control rate in the low dose level .
The hepatocellular carcinomas and pancreatic islet cell adenomas were not dose related .
The low doses in mice and rats are approximately 55 times higher than the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose ( 1 . 5 mcg / kg / day ) , normalized to body surface area .
Mutagenesis In genetic toxicity tests , cyclosporine has not been found to be mutagenic / genotoxic in the Ames Test , the V79 - HGPRT Test , the micronucleus test in mice and Chinese hamsters , the chromosome - aberration tests in Chinese hamster bone - marrow , the mouse dominant lethal assay , and the DNA - repair test in sperm from treated mice .
Cyclosporine was positive in an in vitro sister chromatid exchange ( SCE ) assay using human lymphocytes .
Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of cyclosporine to rats for 12 weeks ( male ) and 2 weeks ( female ) prior to mating produced no adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 15 mg / kg / day ( 1620 times higher than the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two multicenter , randomized , adequate and well - controlled clinical studies treated 1 , 048 patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca ( NCT # 02254265 and NCT # 02688556 ) .
In both studies , compared to vehicle at Day 84 , there was a statistically significant ( p < 0 . 01 ) higher percentage of eyes with increases of ≥ 10 mm from baseline in Schirmer wetting .
This effect was seen in approximately 17 % of CEQUA - treated patients versus approximately 9 % of vehicle - treated patients .
