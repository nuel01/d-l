Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment .
In some cases , patients were hospitalized .
Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea , nausea , or vomiting .
Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting .
Patients who reduced dosage or discontinued OTEZLA generally improved quickly .
Consider OTEZLA dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea , nausea , or vomiting .
5 . 2 Depression Treatment with OTEZLA is associated with an increase in adverse reactions of depression .
Before using OTEZLA in patients with a history of depression and / or suicidal thoughts or behavior prescribers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with OTEZLA in such patients .
Patients , their caregivers , and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression , suicidal thoughts or other mood changes , and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Strong CYP450 Inducers Apremilast exposure is decreased when OTEZLA is co - administered with strong CYP450 inducers ( such as rifampin ) and may result in loss of efficacy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Severe Renal Impairment : Increased systemic exposure of OTEZLA has been observed , reduction in dose to 30 mg once daily is recommended ( 2 . 2 , 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to OTEZLA during pregnancy .
Information about the registry can be obtained by calling 1 - 877 - 311 - 8972 or visiting https : / / mothertobaby . org / ongoing - study / otezla / .
Risk Summary Available pharmacovigilance data with OTEZLA use in pregnant women have not established a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes , but these data are extremely limited .
Based on findings from animal reproduction studies , OTEZLA may increase the risk for fetal loss .
In animal embryo - fetal development studies , the administration of apremilast to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis resulted in dose - related increases in abortion / embryo - fetal death at dose exposures 2 . 1 - times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose ( MRHD ) and no adverse effect at an exposure of 1 . 4 - times the MRHD .
When administered to pregnant mice , during organogenesis there were no apremilast - induced malformations up to exposures 4 . 0 - times the MRHD ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk of fetal loss .
Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal developmental study , pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered apremilast at doses of 20 , 50 , 200 , or 1000 mg / kg / day during the period of organogenesis ( gestation Days 20 through 50 ) .
There was a dose - related increase in spontaneous abortions , with most abortions occurring during Weeks 3 to 4 of dosing in the first trimester , at doses approximately 2 . 1 - times the MRHD and greater ( on an area under the curve [ AUC ] basis at doses ≥ 50 mg / kg / day ) .
No abortifacient effects were observed at a dose approximately 1 . 4 - times the MRHD ( on an AUC basis at a dose of 20 mg / kg / day ) .
Although , there was no evidence for a teratogenic effect at doses of 20 mg / kg / day and greater when examined at day 100 , aborted fetuses were not examined .
In an embryo - fetal development study in mice , apremilast was administered at doses of 250 , 500 , or 750 mg / kg / day to dams during organogenesis ( gestation Day 6 through 15 ) .
In a combined fertility and embryo - fetal development study in mice , apremilast was administered at doses of 10 , 20 , 40 , or 80 mg / kg / day starting 15 days before cohabitation and continuing through gestation Day 15 .
No teratogenic findings attributed to apremilast were observed in either study ; however , there was an increase in postimplantation loss at doses corresponding to a systemic exposure of 2 . 3 - times the MRHD and greater ( ≥ 20 mg / kg / day ) .
At doses of ≥ 20 mg / kg / day skeletal variations included incomplete ossification sites of tarsals , skull , sternebra , and vertebrae .
No effects were observed at a dose approximately 1 . 3 - times the MRHD ( 10 mg / kg / day ) .
Apremilast distributed across the placenta into the fetal compartment in mice and monkeys .
In a pre - and postnatal study in mice , apremilast was administered to pregnant female mice at doses of 10 , 80 , or 300 mg / kg / day from Day 6 of gestation through Day 20 of lactation , with weaning on Day 21 .
Dystocia , reduced viability , and reduced birth weights occurred at doses corresponding to ≥ 4 . 0 - times the MRHD ( on an AUC basis at doses ≥ 80 mg / kg / day ) .
No adverse effects occurred at a dose 1 . 3 - times the MRHD ( 10 mg / kg / day ) .
There was no evidence for functional impairment of physical development , behavior , learning ability , immune competence , or fertility in the offspring at doses up to 7 . 5 - times the MRHD ( on an AUC basis at a dose of 300 mg / kg / day ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of apremilast in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
However , apremilast was detected in the milk of lactating mice .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for OTEZLA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from OTEZLA or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data In mice , following a single oral administration of 10 mg / kg to dams on postpartum day 13 , apremilast concentrations in milk were approximately 1 . 5 - times that of simultaneously collected blood samples .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of OTEZLA in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 1493 subjects who enrolled in Studies PsA - 1 , PsA - 2 , and PsA - 3 a total of 146 psoriatic arthritis subjects were 65 years of age and older , including 19 subjects 75 years and older .
No overall differences were observed in the safety profile of elderly subjects ≥ 65 years of age and younger adult subjects < 65 years of age in the clinical studies .
Of the 1257 subjects who enrolled in two placebo - controlled psoriasis trials ( PSOR 1 and PSOR 2 ) , a total of 108 psoriasis subjects were 65 years of age and older , including 9 subjects who were 75 years of age and older .
No overall differences were observed in the efficacy and safety in elderly subjects ≥ 65 years of age and younger adult subjects < 65 years of age in the clinical trials .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Apremilast pharmacokinetics were characterized in subjects with mild , moderate , and severe renal impairment as defined by a creatinine clearance of 60 - 89 , 30 - 59 , and less than 30 mL per minute , respectively , by the Cockcroft – Gault equation .
While no dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment , the dose of OTEZLA should be reduced to 30 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Apremilast pharmacokinetics were characterized in subjects with moderate ( Child Pugh B ) and severe ( Child Pugh C ) hepatic impairment .
No dose adjustment is necessary in these patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE In case of overdose , patients should seek immediate medical help .
Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care should there be an overdose .
11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in OTEZLA tablets is apremilast .
Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4 ) inhibitor .
Apremilast is known chemically as N - [ 2 - [ ( 1 S ) - 1 - ( 3 - ethoxy - 4 - methoxyphenyl ) - 2 - ( methylsulfonyl ) ethyl ] - 2 , 3 - dihydro - 1 , 3 - dioxo - 1 H - isoindol - 4 - yl ] acetamide .
Its empirical formula is C22H24N2O7S and the molecular weight is 460 . 5 .
The chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] OTEZLA tablets are supplied in 10 - , 20 - , and 30 - mg strengths for oral administration .
Each tablet contains apremilast as the active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients : lactose monohydrate , microcrystalline cellulose , croscarmellose sodium , magnesium stearate , polyvinyl alcohol , titanium dioxide , polyethylene glycol , talc , iron oxide red , iron oxide yellow ( 20 and 30 mg only ) and iron oxide black ( 30 mg only ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Apremilast is an oral small - molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4 ) specific for cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) .
PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels .
The specific mechanism ( s ) by which apremilast exerts its therapeutic action is not well defined .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Apremilast when taken orally is absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of ~ 73 % , with peak plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) occurring at a median time ( tmax ) of ~ 2 . 5 hours .
Co - administration with food does not alter the extent of absorption of apremilast .
Distribution Human plasma protein binding of apremilast is approximately 68 % .
Mean apparent volume of distribution ( Vd ) is 87 L . Metabolism Following oral administration in humans , apremilast is a major circulating component ( 45 % ) followed by inactive metabolite M12 ( 39 % ) , a glucuronide conjugate of O - demethylated apremilast .
It is extensively metabolized in humans with up to 23 metabolites identified in plasma , urine and feces .
Apremilast is metabolized by both cytochrome ( CYP ) oxidative metabolism with subsequent glucuronidation and non - CYP mediated hydrolysis .
In vitro , CYP metabolism of apremilast is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 , with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 .
Elimination The plasma clearance of apremilast is about 10 L / hr in healthy subjects , with a terminal elimination half - life of approximately 6 - 9 hours .
Following oral administration of radio - labeled apremilast , about 58 % and 39 % of the radioactivity is recovered in urine and feces , respectively , with about 3 % and 7 % of the radioactive dose recovered as apremilast in urine and feces , respectively .
Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of apremilast is not affected by moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
Renal Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of apremilast is not affected by mild or moderate renal impairment .
In 8 subjects with severe renal impairment administered a single dose of 30 mg apremilast , the AUC and Cmax of apremilast increased by approximately 88 % and 42 % , respectively [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Age : A single oral dose of 30 - mg apremilast was studied in young adults and elderly healthy subjects .
The apremilast exposure in elderly subjects ( 65 to 85 years of age ) was about 13 % higher in AUC and about 6 % higher in Cmax than in young subjects ( 18 to 55 years of age ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Gender : In pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers , the extent of exposure in females was about 31 % higher and Cmax was about 8 % higher than that in male subjects .
Race and Ethnicity : The pharmacokinetics of apremilast in Chinese and Japanese healthy male subjects is comparable to that in Caucasian healthy male subjects .
In addition , apremilast exposure is similar among Hispanic Caucasians , non - Hispanic Caucasians , and African Americans .
Drug Interactions In vitro data : Apremilast is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , or CYP3A4 and not an inducer of CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP3A4 .
Apremilast is a substrate , but not an inhibitor of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and is not a substrate or an inhibitor of organic anion transporter ( OAT ) 1 and OAT3 , organic cation transporter ( OCT ) 2 , organic anion transporting polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 and OATP1B3 , or breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) .
Drug interaction studies were performed with apremilast and CYP3A4 substrates ( oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate ) , CYP3A and P - gp inhibitor ( ketoconazole ) , CYP450 inducer ( rifampin ) and frequently co - administered drug in this patient population ( methotrexate ) .
No significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed when 30 - mg oral apremilast was administered with either oral contraceptive , ketoconazole , or methotrexate .
Co - administration of the CYP450 inducer rifampin ( 600 mg once daily for 15 days ) with a single oral dose of 30 - mg apremilast resulted in reduction of apremilast AUC and Cmax by 72 % and 43 % , respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies were conducted in mice and rats with apremilast to evaluate its carcinogenic potential .
No evidence of apremilast - induced tumors was observed in mice at oral doses up to 8 . 8 - times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose ( MRHD ) on an AUC basis ( 1000 mg / kg / day ) or in rats at oral doses up to approximately 0 . 08 - and 1 . 1 - times the MRHD , ( 20 mg / kg / day in males and 3 mg / kg / day in females , respectively ) .
Apremilast tested negative in the Ames assay , in vitro chromosome aberration assay of human peripheral blood lymphocytes , and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
In a fertility study of male mice , apremilast at oral doses up to approximately 3 - times the MRHD based on AUC ( up to 50 mg / kg / day ) produced no effects on male fertility .
In a fertility study of female mice , apremilast was administered at oral doses of 10 , 20 , 40 , or 80 mg / kg / day .
At doses ≥ 1 . 8 - times the MRHD ( ≥ 20 mg / kg / day ) , estrous cycles were prolonged , due to lengthening of diestrus which resulted in a longer interval until mating .
Mice that became pregnant at doses of 20 mg / kg / day and greater also had increased incidences of early postimplantation losses .
There was no effect of apremilast approximately 1 . 0 - times the MRHD ( 10 mg / kg / day ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of OTEZLA was evaluated in 3 multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials ( Studies PsA - 1 , PsA - 2 , and PsA - 3 ) of similar design .
A total of 1493 adult patients with active PsA ( ≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints ) despite prior or current treatment with disease - modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) therapy were randomized .
Patients enrolled in these studies had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months .
One qualifying psoriatic skin lesion of at least 2 cm in diameter was required in Study PsA - 3 .
Previous treatment with a biologic , including TNF - blockers was allowed ( up to 10 % could be TNF - blocker therapeutic failures ) .
Across the 3 studies , patients were randomly assigned to placebo ( n = 496 ) , OTEZLA 20 mg ( n = 500 ) , or OTEZLA 30 mg ( n = 497 ) given orally twice daily .
Titration was used over the first 5 days [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Patients were allowed to receive stable doses of concomitant methotrexate [ MTX ( ≤ 25 mg / week ) ] , sulfasalazine [ SSZ ( ≤ 2 g / day ) ] , leflunomide [ LEF ( ≤ 20 mg / day ) ] , low dose oral corticosteroids ( equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone a day ) , and / or nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) during the trial .
Treatment assignments were stratified based on small - molecule DMARD use at baseline in Studies PsA - 1 , PsA - 2 and PsA - 3 .
There was an additional stratification of BSA > 3 % with psoriasis in study PsA - 3 .
The patients who were therapeutic failures of > 3 agents for PsA ( small molecules or biologics ) , or > 1 biologic TNF blocker were excluded .
The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) 20 response at Week 16 .
Placebo - controlled efficacy data were collected and analyzed through Week 24 .
Patients whose tender and swollen joint counts had not improved by at least 20 % were considered non - responders at Week 16 .
Placebo non - responders were re - randomized 1 : 1 in a blinded fashion to either OTEZLA 20 mg twice daily or 30 mg twice daily following the titration schema [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
OTEZLA patients remained on their initial treatment .
At Week 24 , all remaining placebo patients were re - randomized to either 20 mg twice daily or 30 mg twice daily .
Patients with subtypes of PsA were enrolled across the 3 studies , including symmetric polyarthritis ( 62 . 0 % ) , asymmetric oligoarthritis ( 27 . 0 % ) , distal interphalangeal ( DIP ) joint arthritis ( 6 . 0 % ) , arthritis mutilans ( 3 . 0 % ) , and predominant spondylitis ( 2 . 1 % ) .
The median duration of PsA disease was 5 years .
Patients received concomitant therapy with at least one DMARD ( 65 . 0 % ) , MTX ( 55 . 0 % ) , SSZ ( 9 . 0 % ) , LEF ( 7 . 0 % ) , low dose oral corticosteroids ( 14 . 0 % ) , and NSAIDs ( 71 . 0 % ) .
Prior treatment with small - molecule DMARDs only was reported in 76 . 0 % of patients and prior treatment with biologic DMARDs was reported in 22 . 0 % of patients , which includes 9 . 0 % who had failed prior biologic DMARD treatment .
Clinical Response in Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis The percent of patients achieving ACR 20 , 50 and 70 responses in Studies PsA - 1 , PsA - 2 , and PsA - 3 are presented in Table 5 below .
OTEZLA ± DMARDs , compared with Placebo ± DMARDs resulted in a greater improvement in signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis as demonstrated by the proportion of patients with an ACR 20 response at Week 16 .

Consistent results were observed in Studies PsA - 2 and PsA - 3 .
14 . 2 Psoriasis Two multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials ( Studies PSOR - 1 and PSOR - 2 ) enrolled a total of 1257 subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis [ body surface area ( BSA ) involvement of ≥ 10 % , static Physician Global Assessment ( sPGA ) of ≥ 3 ( moderate or severe disease ) , Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI ) score ≥ 12 , candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy ] .
Subjects were allowed to use low - potency topical corticosteroids on the face , axilla and groin .
Subjects with scalp psoriasis were allowed to use coal tar shampoo and / or salicylic acid scalp preparations on scalp lesions .
Study PSOR - 1 enrolled 844 subjects and Study PSOR - 2 enrolled 413 subjects .
In both studies , subjects were randomized 2 : 1 to OTEZLA 30 mg BID or placebo for 16 weeks .
Both studies assessed the proportion of subjects who achieved PASI - 75 at Week 16 and the proportion of subjects who achieved a sPGA score of clear ( 0 ) or almost clear ( 1 ) at Week 16 .
Across both studies , subjects ranged in age from 18 to 83 years , with an overall median age of 46 years .
The mean baseline BSA involvement was 25 . 19 % ( median 21 . 0 % ) , the mean baseline PASI score was 19 . 07 ( median 16 . 80 ) , and the proportion of subjects with sPGA score of 3 ( moderate ) and 4 ( severe ) at baseline were 70 . 0 % and 29 . 8 % , respectively .
Approximately 30 % of all subjects had received prior phototherapy and 54 % had received prior conventional systemic and / or biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis with 37 % receiving prior conventional systemic therapy and 30 % receiving prior biologic therapy .
Approximately one - third of subjects had not received prior phototherapy , conventional systemic nor biologic therapy .
A total of 18 % of subjects had a history of psoriatic arthritis .
