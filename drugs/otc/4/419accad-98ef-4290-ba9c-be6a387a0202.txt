[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Entacapone is a selective and reversible inhibitor of catechol - O - methyltransferase ( COMT ) .
In mammals , COMT is distributed throughout various organs with the highest activities in the liver and kidney .
COMT also occurs in the heart , lung , smooth and skeletal muscles , intestinal tract , reproductive organs , various glands , adipose tissue , skin , blood cells , and neuronal tissues , especially in glial cells .
COMT catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S - adenosyl - L - methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contain a catechol structure .
Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa , catecholamines ( dopamine , norepinephrine , and epinephrine ) and their hydroxylated metabolites .
The function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites .
In the presence of a decarboxylase inhibitor , COMT becomes the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa , catalyzing the metabolism to 3 - methoxy - 4 - hydroxy - L - phenylalanine ( 3 - OMD ) in the brain and periphery .
The mechanism of action of entacapone is believed to be through its ability to inhibit COMT and alter the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa .
When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor , such as carbidopa , plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone .
It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration , these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain , leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson ’ s Disease .
The higher levodopa levels also lead to increased levodopa adverse effects , sometimes requiring a decrease in the dose of levodopa .
In animals , while entacapone enters the CNS to a minimal extent , it has been shown to inhibit central COMT activity .
In humans , entacapone inhibits the COMT enzyme in peripheral tissues .
The effects of entacapone on central COMT activity in humans have not been studied .
Pharmacodynamics COMT Activity in Erythrocytes : Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that entacapone reversibly inhibits human erythrocyte catechol - O - methyltransferase ( COMT ) activity after oral administration .
There was a linear correlation between entacapone dose and erythrocyte COMT inhibition , the maximum inhibition being 82 % following an 800 - mg single dose .
With a 200 - mg single dose of entacapone , maximum inhibition of erythrocyte COMT activity is on average 65 % with a return to baseline level within 8 hours .
Effect on the Pharmacokinetics of Levodopa and its Metabolites When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa / carbidopa , it increases the area under the curve ( AUC ) of levodopa by approximately 35 % and the elimination half - life of levodopa is prolonged from 1 . 3 h to 2 . 4 h .
In general , the average peak levodopa plasma concentration and the time of its occurrence ( Tmax of 1 hour ) are unaffected .
The onset of effect occurs after the first administration and is maintained during long - term treatment .
Studies in Parkinson ’ s Disease patients suggest that the maximal effect occurs with 200 - mg entacapone .
Plasma levels of 3 - OMD are markedly and dose - dependently decreased by entacapone when given with levodopa / carbidopa .
Pharmacokinetics of Entacapone Entacapone pharmacokinetics are linear over the dose range of 5 mg to 800 mg , and are independent of levodopa / carbidopa coadministration .
The elimination of entacapone is biphasic , with an elimination half - life of 0 . 4 h to 0 . 7 h based on the ( - phase and 2 . 4 h based on the γ - phase .
The γ - phase accounts for approximately 10 % of the total AUC .
The total body clearance after i . v . administration is 850 mL / min .
After a single 200 - mg dose of entacapone , the Cmax is approximately 1 . 2 mcg / mL .
Absorption : Entacapone is rapidly absorbed , with a Tmax of approximately 1 hour .
The absolute bioavailability following oral administration is 35 % .
Food does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone .
Distribution : The volume of distribution of entacapone at steady state after i . v . injection is small ( 20 L ) .
Entacapone does not distribute widely into tissues due to its high plasma protein binding .
Based on in vitro studies , the plasma protein binding of entacapone is 98 % over the concentration range of 0 . 4 to 50 mcg / mL .
Entacapone binds mainly to serum albumin .
Metabolism and Elimination : Entacapone is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion , with only a very small amount ( 0 . 2 % of dose ) found unchanged in urine .
The main metabolic pathway is isomerization to the cis - isomer , followed by direct glucuronidation of the parent and cis - isomer ; the glucuronide conjugate is inactive .
After oral administration of a 14 C - labeled dose of entacapone , 10 % of labeled parent and metabolite is excreted in urine and 90 % in feces .
Special Populations : Entacapone pharmacokinetics are independent of age .
No formal gender studies have been conducted .
Racial representation in clinical trials was largely limited to Caucasians ( there were only 4 blacks in one US trial and no Asians in any of the clinical trials ) ; no conclusions can therefore be reached about the effect of entacapone on groups other than Caucasian .
Hepatic Impairment : A single 200 - mg dose of entacapone , without levodopa / dopa decarboxylase inhibitor coadministration , showed approximately twofold higher AUC and Cmax values in patients with a history of alcoholism and hepatic impairment ( n = 10 ) compared to normal subjects ( n = 10 ) .
All patients had biopsy - proven liver cirrhosis caused by alcohol .
According to Child - Pugh grading 7 patients with liver disease had mild hepatic impairment and 3 patients had moderate hepatic impairment .
As only about 10 % of the entacapone dose is excreted in urine as parent compound and conjugated glucuronide , biliary excretion appears to be the major route of excretion of this drug .
Consequently , entacapone should be administered with care to patients with biliary obstruction .
Renal Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of entacapone have been investigated after a single 200 - mg entacapone dose , without levodopa / dopa decarboxylase inhibitor coadministration , in a specific renal impairment study .
There were three groups : normal subjects ( n = 7 ; creatinine clearance > 1 . 12 mL / sec / 1 . 73 m2 ) , moderate impairment ( n = 10 ; creatinine clearance ranging from 0 . 60 to 0 . 89 mL / sec / 1 . 73 m2 ) , and severe impairment ( n = 7 ; creatinine clearance ranging from 0 . 20 to 0 . 44 mL / sec / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
No important effects of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of entacapone were found .
Drug Interactions : See PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions .
Clinical Studies The effectiveness of entacapone as an adjunct to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson ’ s Disease was established in three 24 - week multicenter , randomized , double - blind placebo - controlled trials in patients with Parkinson ’ s Disease .
In two of these trials , the patients ’ disease was " fluctuating " , i . e . , was characterized by documented periods of " On " ( periods of relatively good functioning ) and " Off " ( periods of relatively poor functioning ) , despite optimum levodopa therapy .
There was also a withdrawal period following 6 months of treatment .
In the third trial patients were not required to have been experiencing fluctuations .
Prior to the controlled part of the trials , patients were stabilized on levodopa for 2 to 4 weeks .
Entacapone has not been systematically evaluated in patients who do not experience fluctuations .
In the first two studies to be described , patients were randomized to receive placebo or entacapone 200 mg administered concomitantly with each dose of levodopa / carbidopa ( up to 10 times daily , but averaging 4 to 6 doses per day ) .
The formal double - blind portion of both trials was 6 months long .
Patients recorded the time spent in the " On " and " Off " states in home diaries periodically throughout the duration of the trial .
In one study , conducted in the Nordic countries , the primary outcome measure was the total mean time spent in the " On " state during an 18 - hour diary recorded day ( 6 AM to midnight ) .
In the other study , the primary outcome measure was the proportion of awake time spent over 24 hours in the " On " state .
In addition to the primary outcome measure , the amount of time spent in the " Off " state was evaluated , and patients were also evaluated by subparts of the Unified Parkinson ’ s Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , a frequently used multi - item rating scale intended to assess mentation ( Part I ) , activities of daily living ( Part II ) , motor function ( Part III ) , complications of therapy ( Part IV ) , and disease staging ( Part V & VI ) ; an investigator ’ s and patient ’ s global assessment of clinical condition , a 7 - point subjective scale designed to assess global functioning in Parkinson ’ s Disease ; and the change in daily levodopa / carbidopa dose .
In one of the studies , 171 patients were randomized in 16 centers in Finland , Norway , Sweden , and Denmark ( Nordic study ) , all of whom received concomitant levodopa plus dopa - decarboxylase inhibitor ( either levodopa / carbidopa or levodopa / benserazide ) .
In the second trial , 205 patients were randomized in 17 centers in North America ( US and Canada ) ; all patients received concomitant levodopa / carbidopa .
The following tables display the results of these two trials : Table 1 .

Withdrawal of entacapone : In the North American study , abrupt withdrawal of entacapone , without alteration of the dose of levodopa / carbidopa , resulted in a significant worsening of fluctuations , compared to placebo .
In some cases , symptoms were slightly worse than at baseline , but returned to approximately baseline severity within two weeks following levodopa dose increase on average by 80 mg .
In the Nordic study , similarly , a significant worsening of parkinsonian symptoms was observed after entacapone withdrawal , as assessed two weeks after drug withdrawal .
At this phase , the symptoms were approximately at baseline severity following levodopa dose increase by about 50 mg .
In the third placebo controlled trial , a total of 301 patients were randomized in 32 centers in Germany and Austria .
In this trial , as in the other two trials , entacapone 200 mg was administered with each dose of levodopa / dopa decarboxylase inhibitor ( up to 10 times daily ) and UPDRS Parts II and III and total daily " On " time were the primary measures of effectiveness .

Entacapone tablets effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated in patients with idiopathic Parkinson ’ s Disease who do not experience end - of - dose " wearing - off " .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Entacapone tablets are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients .
WARNINGS Monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) and COMT are the two major enzyme systems involved in the metabolism of catecholamines .
It is theoretically possible , therefore , that the combination of entacapone and a non - selective MAO inhibitor ( e . g . , phenelzine and tranylcypromine ) would result in inhibition of the majority of the pathways responsible for normal catecholamine metabolism .
For this reason , patients should ordinarily not be treated concomitantly with entacapone and a non - selective MAO inhibitor .
Entacapone can be taken concomitantly with a selective MAO - B inhibitor ( e . g . , selegiline ) .
Drugs Metabolized By Catechol - O - Methyltransferase ( COMT ) When a single 400 - mg dose of entacapone was given together with intravenous isoprenaline ( isoproterenol ) and epinephrine without coadministered levodopa / dopa decarboxylase inhibitor , the overall mean maximal changes in heart rate during infusion were about 50 % and 80 % higher than with placebo , for isoprenaline and epinephrine , respectively .
Therefore , drugs known to be metabolized by COMT , such as isoproterenol , epinephrine , norepinephrine , dopamine , dobutamine , alpha - methyldopa , apomorphine , isoetherine , and bitolterol should be administered with caution in patients receiving entacapone regardless of the route of administration ( including inhalation ) , as their interaction may result in increased heart rates , possibly arrhythmias , and excessive changes in blood pressure .
Ventricular tachycardia was noted in one 32 - year - old healthy male volunteer in an interaction study after epinephrine infusion and oral entacapone administration .
Treatment with propranolol was required .
A causal relationship to entacapone administration appears probable but cannot be attributed with certainty .
PRECAUTIONS Hypotension / Syncope Dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson ’ s Disease patients has been associated with orthostatic hypotension .
Entacapone enhances levodopa bioavailability and , therefore , might be expected to increase the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension .
In entacapone clinical trials , however , no differences from placebo were seen for measured orthostasis or symptoms of orthostasis .
Orthostatic hypotension was documented at least once in 2 . 7 % and 3 % of the patients treated with 200 mg entacapone and placebo , respectively .
A total of 4 . 3 % and 4 % of the patients treated with 200 mg entacapone and placebo , respectively , reported orthostatic symptoms at some time during their treatment and also had at least one episode of orthostatic hypotension documented ( however , the episode of orthostatic symptoms itself was not accompanied by vital sign measurements ) .
Neither baseline treatment with dopamine agonists or selegiline , nor the presence of orthostasis at baseline , increased the risk of orthostatic hypotension in patients treated with entacapone compared to patients on placebo .
In the large controlled trials , approximately 1 . 2 % and 0 . 8 % of 200 mg entacapone and placebo patients , respectively , reported at least one episode of syncope .
Reports of syncope were generally more frequent in patients in both treatment groups who had an episode of documented hypotension ( although the episodes of syncope , obtained by history , were themselves not documented with vital sign measurement ) .
Diarrhea and Colitis In clinical trials , diarrhea developed in 60 of 603 ( 10 % ) and 16 of 400 ( 4 % ) of patients treated with 200 mg entacapone and placebo , respectively .
In patients treated with entacapone , diarrhea was generally mild to moderate in severity ( 8 . 6 % ) but was regarded as severe in 1 . 3 % .
Diarrhea resulted in withdrawal in 10 of 603 ( 1 . 7 % ) patients , 7 ( 1 . 2 % ) with mild and moderate diarrhea and 3 ( 0 . 5 % ) with severe diarrhea .
Diarrhea generally resolved after discontinuation of entacapone .
Two patients with diarrhea were hospitalized .
Typically , diarrhea presents within 4 to 12 weeks after entacapone is started , but it may appear as early as the first week and as late as many months after the initiation of treatment .
Diarrhea may be associated with weight loss , dehydration , and hypokalemia .
Post - marketing experience has shown that diarrhea may be a sign of drug - induced microscopic colitis , primarily lymphocytic colitis .
In these cases diarrhea has usually been moderate to severe , watery , and non - bloody , at times associated with dehydration , abdominal pain , weight loss , and hypokalemia .
In the majority of cases , diarrhea and other colitis - related symptoms resolved or significantly improved when entacapone treatment was stopped .
In some patients with biopsy confirmed colitis , diarrhea had resolved or significantly improved after discontinuation of entacapone but recurred after retreatment with entacapone .
If prolonged diarrhea is suspected to be related to entacapone , the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy considered .
If the cause of prolonged diarrhea remains unclear or continues after stopping entacapone , then further diagnostic investigations including colonoscopy and biopsies should be considered .
Hallucinations Dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson ’ s Disease patients has been associated with hallucinations .
In clinical trials , hallucinations developed in approximately 4 % of patients treated with 200 mg entacapone or placebo .
Hallucinations led to drug discontinuation and premature withdrawal from clinical trials in 0 . 8 % and 0 % of patients treated with 200 mg entacapone and placebo , respectively .
Hallucinations led to hospitalization in 1 % and 0 . 3 % of patients in the 200 mg entacapone and placebo groups , respectively .
Dyskinesia Entacapone may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause and / or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia .
Although decreasing the dose of levodopa may ameliorate this side effect , many patients in controlled trials continued to experience frequent dyskinesias despite a reduction in their dose of levodopa .
The rates of withdrawal for dyskinesia were 1 . 5 % and 0 . 8 % for 200 mg entacapone and placebo , respectively .
Other Events Reported With Dopaminergic Therapy The events listed below are rare events known to be associated with the use of drugs that increase dopaminergic activity , although they are most often associated with the use of direct dopamine agonists .
Rhabdomyolysis : Cases of severe rhabdomyolysis have been reported with entacapone use .
The complicated nature of these cases makes it impossible to determine what role , if any , entacapone played in their pathogenesis .
Severe prolonged motor activity including dyskinesia may account for rhabdomyolysis .
One case , however , included fever and alteration of consciousness .
It is therefore possible that the rhabdomyolysis may be a result of the syndrome described in Hyperpyrexia and Confusion ( see PRECAUTIONS , Other Events Reported With Dopaminergic Therapy ) .
Hyperpyrexia and Confusion : Cases of a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome characterized by elevated temperature , muscular rigidity , altered consciousness , and elevated CPK have been reported in association with the rapid dose reduction or withdrawal of other dopaminergic drugs .
Several cases with similar signs and symptoms have been reported in association with entacapone therapy , although no information about dose manipulation is available .
The complicated nature of these cases makes it difficult to determine what role , if any , entacapone may have played in their pathogenesis .
No cases have been reported following the abrupt withdrawal or dose reduction of entacapone treatment during clinical studies .
Prescribers should exercise caution when discontinuing entacapone treatment .
When considered necessary , withdrawal should proceed slowly .
If a decision is made to discontinue treatment with entacapone , recommendations include monitoring the patient closely and adjusting other dopaminergic treatments as needed .
This syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient who develops a high fever or severe rigidity .
Tapering entacapone has not been systematically evaluated .
Fibrotic Complications : Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis , pulmonary infiltrates , pleural effusion , and pleural thickening have been reported in some patients treated with ergot derived dopaminergic agents .
These complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued , but complete resolution does not always occur .
Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds , whether other , nonergot derived drugs ( e . g . , entacapone ) that increase dopaminergic activity can cause them is unknown .
It should be noted that the expected incidence of fibrotic complications is so low that even if entacapone caused these complications at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies , it is unlikely that it would have been detected in a cohort of the size exposed to entacapone .
Four cases of pulmonary fibrosis were reported during clinical development of entacapone ; three of these patients were also treated with pergolide and one with bromocriptine .
The duration of treatment with entacapone ranged from 7 to 17 months .
Melanoma : Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson ’ s disease have a higher risk ( 2 - to approximately 6 - fold higher ) of developing melanoma than the general population .
Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson ’ s disease or other factors , such as drugs used to treat Parkinson ’ s disease , is unclear .
For the reasons stated above , patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using entacapone for any indication .
Ideally , periodic skin examination should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals ( e . g . , dermatologists ) .
Renal Toxicity In a 1 year toxicity study , entacapone ( plasma exposure 20 times that in humans receiving the maximum recommended daily dose of 1600 mg ) caused an increased incidence in male rats of nephrotoxicity that was characterized by regenerative tubules , thickening of basement membranes , infiltration of mononuclear cells and tubular protein casts .
These effects were not associated with changes in clinical chemistry parameters , and there is no established method for monitoring for the possible occurrence of these lesions in humans .
Although this toxicity could represent a species - specific effect , there is not yet evidence that this is so .
Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment should be treated with caution .
The AUC and Cmax of entacapone approximately doubled in patients with documented liver disease compared to controls .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics of Entacapone and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to take entacapone tablets only as prescribed .
Patients should be informed that hallucinations can occur .
Patients should be advised that they may develop postural ( orthostatic ) hypotension with or without symptoms such as dizziness , nausea , syncope , and sweating .
Hypotension may occur more frequently during initial therapy .
Accordingly , patients should be cautioned against rising rapidly after sitting or lying down , especially if they have been doing so for prolonged periods , and especially at the initiation of treatment with entacapone tablets .
Patients should be advised that they should neither drive a car nor operate other complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on entacapone tablets to gauge whether or not it affects their mental and / or motor performance adversely .
Because of the possible additive sedative effects , caution should be used when patients are taking other CNS depressants in combination with entacapone tablets .
Patients should be informed that nausea may occur , especially at the initiation of treatment with entacapone tablets .
Patients should be informed that diarrhea may occur with entacapone tablets and it may have a delayed onset .
Sometimes prolonged diarrhea may be caused by colitis ( inflammation of the large intestine ) .
Patients with diarrhea should drink fluids to maintain adequate hydration and monitor for weight loss .
If diarrhea associated with entacapone tablet is prolonged , discontinuing the drug is expected to lead to resolution , if diarrhea continues after stopping entacapone , further diagnostic investigations may be needed .
Patients should be advised of the possibility of an increase in dyskinesia .
Patients should be advised that treatment with entacapone may cause a change in the color of their urine ( a brownish orange discoloration ) that is not clinically relevant .
In controlled trials , 10 % of patients treated with entacapone tablets reported urine discoloration compared to 0 % of placebo patients .
Although entacapone tablets have not been shown to be teratogenic in animals , it is always given in conjunction with levodopa / carbidopa , which is known to cause visceral and skeletal malformations in the rabbit .
Accordingly , patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy ( see PRECAUTIONS , Pregnancy ) .
Entacapone is excreted into maternal milk in rats .
Because of the possibility that entacapone may be excreted into human maternal milk , patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they intend to breastfeed or are breastfeeding an infant .
There have been reports of patients experiencing intense urges to gamble , increased sexual urges , and other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that increase central dopaminergic tone , that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson ’ s disease , including entacapone tablets .
Although it is not proven that the medications caused these events , these urges were reported to have stopped in some cases when the dose was reduced or the medication was stopped .
Prescribers should ask patients about the development of new or increased gambling urges , sexual urges or other urges while being treated with entacapone tablets .
Patients should inform their physician if they experience new or increased gambling urges , increased sexual urges or other intense urges while taking entacapone tablets .
Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking entacapone tablets .
Laboratory Tests Entacapone is a chelator of iron .
The impact of entacapone on the body ’ s iron stores is unknown ; however , a tendency towards decreasing serum iron concentrations was noted in clinical trials .
In a controlled clinical study serum ferritin levels ( as marker of iron deficiency and subclinical anemia ) were not changed with entacapone compared to placebo after one year of treatment and there was no difference in rates of anemia or decreased hemoglobin levels .
Special Populations Patients with hepatic impairment should be treated with caution ( see INDICATIONS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Drug Interactions In vitro studies of human CYP enzymes showed that entacapone inhibited the CYP enzymes 1A2 , 2A6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 and 3 A only at very high concentrations ( IC50 from 200 to over 1000 µM ; an oral 200 mg dose achieves a highest level of approximately 5 µM in people ) ; these enzymes would therefore not be expected to be inhibited in clinical use .
Protein Binding Entacapone is highly protein bound ( 98 % ) .
In vitro studies have shown no binding displacement between entacapone and other highly bound drugs , such as warfarin , salicylic acid , phenylbutazone , and diazepam .
Drugs Metabolized by Catechol - O - methyltransferase ( COMT ) See WARNINGS .
Hormone levels Levodopa is known to depress prolactin secretion and increase growth hormone levels .
Treatment with entacapone coadministered with levodopa / dopa decarboxylase inhibitor does not change these effects .
Effect of Entacapone on the Metabolism of Other Drugs See WARNINGS regarding concomitant use of entacapone and non - selective MAO inhibitors .
No interaction was noted with the MAO - B inhibitor selegiline in two multiple - dose interaction studies when entacapone was coadministered with a levodopa / dopa decarboxylase inhibitor ( n = 29 ) .
More than 600 Parkinson ’ s Disease patients in clinical trials have used selegiline in combination with entacapone and levodopa / dopa decarboxylase inhibitor .
As most entacapone excretion is via the bile , caution should be exercised when drugs known to interfere with biliary excretion , glucuronidation , and intestinal beta - glucuronidase are given concurrently with entacapone .
These include probenecid , cholestyramine , and some antibiotics ( e . g . , erythromycin , rifampicin , ampicillin and chloramphenicol ) .
No interaction with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine was shown in a single - dose study with entacapone without coadministered levodopa / dopa - decarboxylase inhibitor .
Carcinogenesis Two - year carcinogenicity studies of entacapone were conducted in mice and rats .
Rats were treated once daily by oral gavage with entacapone doses of 20 , 90 , or 400 mg / kg .
An increased incidence of renal tubular adenomas and carcinomas was found in male rats treated with the highest dose of entacapone .
Plasma exposures ( AUC ) associated with this dose were approximately 20 times higher than estimated plasma exposures of humans receiving the maximum recommended daily dose of entacapone ( MRDD = 1600 mg ) .
Mice were treated once daily by oral gavage with doses of 20 , 100 or 600 mg / kg of entacapone ( 0 . 05 , 0 . 3 , and 2 times the MRDD for humans on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Because of a high incidence of premature mortality in mice receiving the highest dose of entacapone , the mouse study is not an adequate assessment of carcinogenicity .
Although no treatment related tumors were observed in animals receiving the lower doses , the carcinogenic potential of entacapone has not been fully evaluated .
The carcinogenic potential of entacapone administered in combination with levodopa / carbidopa has not been evaluated .
Mutagenesis Entacapone was mutagenic and clastogenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma / thymidine kinase assay in the presence and absence of metabolic activation , and was clastogenic in cultured human lymphocytes in the presence of metabolic activation .
Entacapone , either alone or in combination with levodopa / carbidopa , was not clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test or mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay ( Ames test ) .
Impairment of Fertility Entacapone did not impair fertility or general reproductive performance in rats treated with up to 700 mg / kg / day ( plasma AUCs 28 times those in humans receiving the MRDD ) .
Delayed mating , but no fertility impairment , was evident in female rats treated with 700 mg / kg / day of entacapone .
Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C .
In embryofetal development studies , entacapone was administered to pregnant animals throughout organogenesis at doses of up to 1000 mg / kg / day in rats and 300 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
Increased incidences of fetal variations were evident in litters from rats treated with the highest dose , in the absence of overt signs of maternal toxicity .
The maternal plasma drug exposure ( AUC ) associated with this dose was approximately 34 times the estimated plasma exposure in humans receiving the maximum recommended daily dose ( MRDD ) of 1600 mg .
Increased frequencies of abortions and late / total resorptions and decreased fetal weights were observed in the litters of rabbits treated with maternotoxic doses of 100 mg / kg / day ( plasma AUCs 0 . 4 times those in humans receiving the MRDD ) or greater .
There was no evidence of teratogenicity in these studies .
However , when entacapone was administered to female rats prior to mating and during early gestation , an increased incidence of fetal eye anomalies ( macrophthalmia , microphthalmia , anophthalmia ) was observed in the litters of dams treated with doses of 160 mg / kg / day ( plasma AUCs 7 times those in humans receiving the MRDD ) or greater , in the absence of maternotoxicity .
Administration of up to 700 mg / kg / day ( plasma AUCs 28 times those in humans receiving the MRDD ) to female rats during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation , produced no evidence of developmental impairment in the offspring .
Entacapone is always given concomitantly with levodopa / carbidopa , which is known to cause visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits .
The teratogenic potential of entacapone in combination with levodopa / carbidopa was not assessed in animals .
There is no experience from clinical studies regarding the use of entacapone in pregnant women .
Therefore , entacapone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing Women In animal studies , entacapone was excreted into maternal rat milk .
It is not known whether entacapone is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when entacapone is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use There is no identified potential use of entacapone in pediatric patients .
ADVERSE REACTIONS During the pre - marketing development of entacapone , 1450 patients with Parkinson ’ s Disease were treated with entacapone .
Included were patients with fluctuating symptoms , as well as those with stable responses to levodopa therapy .
All patients received concomitant treatment with levodopa preparations , however , and were similar in other clinical aspects .
The most commonly observed adverse events ( > 5 % ) in the double - blind , placebo - controlled trials ( N = 1003 ) associated with the use of entacapone and not seen at an equivalent frequency among the placebo - treated patients were : dyskinesia / hyperkinesia , nausea , urine discoloration , diarrhea , and abdominal pain .
Approximately 14 % of the 603 patients given entacapone in the double - blind , placebo - controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared to 9 % of the 400 patients who received placebo .
The most frequent causes of discontinuation in decreasing order are : psychiatric reasons ( 2 % vs . 1 % ) , diarrhea ( 2 % vs . 0 % ) , dyskinesia / hyperkinesia ( 2 % vs . 1 % ) , nausea ( 2 % vs . 1 % ) , abdominal pain ( 1 % vs . 0 % ) , and aggravation of Parkinson ’ s Disease symptoms ( 1 % vs . 1 % ) .
Adverse Event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies Table 4 lists treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1 % of patients treated with entacapone participating in the double - blind , placebo - controlled studies and that were numerically more common in the entacapone group , compared to placebo .
In these studies , either entacapone or placebo was added to levodopa / carbidopa ( or levodopa / benserazide ) .

Similarly , the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments , uses , and investigators .
The cited figures do , however , provide the prescriber with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse events observed in the population studied .
Effects of gender and age on adverse reactions No differences were noted in the rate of adverse events attributable to entacapone by age or gender .
DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Entacapone is not a controlled substance .
Animal studies to evaluate the drug abuse and potential dependence have not been conducted .
Although clinical trials have not revealed any evidence of the potential for abuse , tolerance or physical dependence , systematic studies in humans designed to evaluate these effects have not been performed .
OVERDOSAGE There have been no reported cases of either accidental or intentional overdose with entacapone tablets .
However , COMT inhibition by entacapone treatment is dose - dependent .
A massive overdose of entacapone may theoretically produce a 100 % inhibition of the COMT enzyme in people , thereby preventing the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous catechols .
The highest single dose of entacapone administered to humans was 800 mg , resulting in a plasma concentration of 14 . 1 mcg / mL .
The highest daily dose given to humans was 2400 mg , administered in one study as 400 mg six times daily with levodopa / carbidopa for 14 days in 15 Parkinson ’ s Disease patients , and in another study as 800 mg t . i . d . for 7 days in 8 healthy volunteers .
At this daily dose , the peak plasma concentrations of entacapone averaged 2 mcg / mL ( at 45 min . , compared to 1 and 1 . 2 mcg / mL with 200 mg entacapone at 45 min . )
.
Abdominal pain and loose stools were the most commonly observed adverse events during this study .
Daily doses as high as 2000 mg entacapone have been administered as 200 mg 10 times daily with levodopa / carbidopa or levodopa / benserazide for at least 1 year in 10 patients , for at least 2 years in 8 patients and for at least 3 years in 7 patients .
Overall , however , clinical experience with daily doses above 1600 mg is limited .
The range of lethal plasma concentrations of entacapone based on animal data was 80 to 130 mcg / mL in mice .
Respiratory difficulties , ataxia , hypoactivity , and convulsions were observed in mice after high oral ( gavage ) doses .
Management of Overdose Management of entacapone overdose is symptomatic ; there is no known antidote to entacapone .
Hospitalization is advised , and general supportive care is indicated .
There is no experience with hemodialysis or hemoperfusion , but these procedures are unlikely to be of benefit , because entacapone is highly bound to plasma proteins .
An immediate gastric lavage and repeated doses of charcoal over time may hasten the elimination of entacapone by decreasing its absorption / reabsorption from the GI tract .
The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully monitored and appropriate supportive measures employed .
The possibility of drug interactions , especially with catechol - structured drugs , should be borne in mind .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose of entacapone is one 200 mg tablet administered concomitantly with each levodopa / carbidopa dose to a maximum of 8 times daily ( 200 mg x 8 = 1600 mg per day ) .
Clinical experience with daily doses above 1600 mg is limited .
Entacapone tablets should always be administered in association with levodopa / carbidopa .
Entacapone has no antiparkinsonian effect of its own .
In clinical trials , the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been ≥ 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesias before beginning treatment .
To optimize an individual patient ’ s response , reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary .
In clinical trials , the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25 % in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction .
( More than 58 % of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction . )
Entacapone tablets can be combined with both the immediate and sustained - release formulations of levodopa / carbidopa .
Entacapone tablets may be taken with or without food ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) .
Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function : Patients with hepatic impairment should be treated with caution .
The AUC and Cmax of entacapone approximately doubled in patients with documented liver disease , compared to controls .
However , these studies were conducted with single - dose entacapone without levodopa / dopa decarboxylase inhibitor coadministration , and therefore the effects of liver disease on the kinetics of chronically administered entacapone have not been evaluated ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics of Entacapone ) .
Withdrawing Patients from Entacapone Tablets : Rapid withdrawal or abrupt reduction in the entacapone tablets dose could lead to emergence of signs and symptoms of Parkinson ’ s Disease ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Clinical Studies ) , and may lead to Hyperpyrexia and Confusion , a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( see PRECAUTIONS , Other Events Reported With Dopaminergic Therapy ) .
This syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient who develops a high fever or severe rigidity .
If a decision is made to discontinue treatment with entacapone tablets , patients should be monitored closely and other dopaminergic treatments should be adjusted as needed .
Although tapering entacapone tablets has not been systematically evaluated , it seems prudent to withdraw patients slowly if the decision to discontinue treatment is made .
