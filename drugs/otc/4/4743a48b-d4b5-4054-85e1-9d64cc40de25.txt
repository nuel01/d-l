1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Eplerenone is an aldosterone antagonist indicated for : • Improving survival of stable patients with LV systolic dysfunction ( LVEF ≤ 40 % ) and CHF after an acute myocardial infarction .
( 1 . 2 ) • Hypertension , alone or combined with other agents .
( 1 . 3 ) 1 . 1 Patient Selection Considerations Serum potassium levels should be measured before initiating eplerenone therapy and eplerenone should not be prescribed if serum potassium is > 5 . 5 mEq / L .
[ See 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ] .
1 . 2 Congestive Heart Failure Post - Myocardial Infarction Eplerenone is indicated to improve survival of stable patients with left ventricular ( LV ) systolic dysfunction ( ejection fraction ≤ 40 % ) and clinical evidence of congestive heart failure ( CHF ) after an acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) .
1 . 3 Hypertension Eplerenone is indicated for the treatment of hypertension .
Eplerenone may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION CHF Post - MI : Initiate treatment with 25 mg once daily .
Titrate to maximum of 50 mg once daily within 4 weeks , as tolerated .
Dose adjustments may be required based on potassium levels .
( 2 . 1 ) Hypertension : 50 mg once daily , alone or combined with other antihypertensive agents .
For inadequate response , increase to 50 mg twice daily .
Higher dosages are not recommended .
( 2 . 2 ) For all patients : Measure serum potassium before starting eplerenone and periodically thereafter .
( 2 . 3 ) 2 . 1 Congestive Heart Failure Post - Myocardial Infarction Treatment should be initiated at 25 mg once daily and titrated to the recommended dose of 50 mg once daily , preferably within 4 weeks as tolerated by the patient .
Eplerenone may be administered with or without food .
Once treatment with eplerenone has begun , adjust the dose based on the serum potassium level as shown in Table 1 .
Table 1 : Dose Adjustment in Congestive Heart Failure Post - MISerum Potassium ( mEq / L ) Action Dose Adjustment < 5 . 0 Increase 25 mg every other day to 25 mg once daily 25 mg once daily to 50 mg once daily 5 . 0 – 5 . 4 Maintain No adjustment 5 . 5 – 5 . 9 Decrease 50 mg once daily to 25 mg once daily 25 mg once daily to 25 mg every other day 25 mg every other day to withhold ≥ 6 . 0 Withhold Restart at 25 mg every other day when potassium levels fall to < 5 . 5 mEq / L 2 . 2 Hypertension The recommended starting dose of eplerenone is 50 mg administered once daily .
The full therapeutic effect of eplerenone is apparent within 4 weeks .
For patients with an inadequate blood pressure response to 50 mg once daily the dosage of eplerenone should be increased to 50 mg twice daily .
Higher dosages of eplerenone are not recommended because they have no greater effect on blood pressure than 100 mg and are associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia .
[ See CLINICAL STUDIES , 14 . 2 Hypertension . ]
2 . 3 Recommended Monitoring Serum potassium should be measured before initiating eplerenone therapy , within the first week and at one month after the start of treatment or dose adjustment .
Serum potassium should be assessed periodically thereafter .
Patient characteristics and serum potassium levels may indicate that additional monitoring is appropriate .
[ See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , 5 . 1 Hyperkalemia , ADVERSE REACTIONS , 6 . 2 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings . ]
In the EPHESUS study [ See CLINICAL STUDIES , 14 . 1 Congestive Heart Failure Post - Myocardial Infarction ] , the majority of hyperkalemia was observed within the first three months after randomization .
In all patients taking eplerenone who start taking a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor , check serum potassium and serum creatinine in 3 to 7 days .
2 . 4 Dose Modifications for Specific Populations For hypertensive patients receiving moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , erythromycin , saquinavir , verapamil and fluconazole ) , the starting dose of eplerenone should be reduced to 25 mg once daily .
[ See DRUG INTERACTIONS , 7 . 1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors . ]
No adjustment of the starting dose is recommended for the elderly or for patients with mild - to - moderate hepatic impairment .
[ See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics . ]
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS • 25 mg tablets : round , white , film - coated tablets debossed with " SZ " on one side and " 12 " on the other .
• 50 mg tablets : round , yellow film - coated tablets debossed with " SZ " on one side and " 16 " on the other .
Tablets : 25 mg , 50 mg ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS For All Patients Eplerenone tablets are contraindicated in all patients with : • serum potassium > 5 . 5 mEq / L at initiation , • creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL / min , or • concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , nefazodone , troleandomycin , clarithromycin , ritonavir and nelfinavir ) .
[ See DRUG INTERACTIONS , 7 . 1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics . ]
For Patients Treated for Hypertension Eplerenone tablets is contraindicated for the treatment of hypertension in patients with : • type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria , • serum creatinine > 2 . 0 mg / dL in males or > 1 . 8 mg / dL in females , • creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min , or • concomitant administration of potassium supplements or potassium - sparing diuretics ( e . g . , amiloride , spironolactone or triamterene ) .
[ See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , 5 . 1 Hyperkalemia , ADVERSE REACTIONS , 6 . 2 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings , 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS , and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics . ]
For all patients : • Serum potassium > 5 . 5 mEq / L at initiation ( 4 ) • Creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL / min ( 4 ) • Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( 4 , 7 . 1 ) For the treatment of hypertension : • Type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria ( 4 ) • Serum creatinine > 2 . 0 mg / dL in males , > 1 . 8 mg / dL in females ( 4 ) • Creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min ( 4 ) • Concomitant use of potassium supplements or potassium - sparing diuretics ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hyperkalemia : Patients with decreased renal function and diabetics with proteinuria are at increased risk .
Proper patient selection and monitoring and avoiding certain concomitant medications can minimize the risk .
( 5 . 1 ) • Eplerenone Tablets 50 mg contain FD & C Yellow No . 5 ( tartrazine ) which may cause allergic - type reactions ( including bronchial asthma ) in certain susceptible persons .
Although the overall incidence of FD & C Yellow No . 5 ( tartrazine ) sensitivity in the general population is low , it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Hyperkalemia Minimize the risk of hyperkalemia with proper patient selection and monitoring and avoidance of certain concomitant medications [ See 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS , ADVERSE REACTIONS , 6 . 2 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings ) and 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS ] .
Monitor patients for the development of hyperkalemia until the effect of eplerenone is established .
Patients who develop hyperkalemia ( > 5 . 5 mEq / L ) may continue eplerenone therapy with proper dose adjustment .
Dose reduction decreases potassium levels .
[ See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , 2 . 1 Congestive Heart Failure Post - Myocardial Infarction . ]
The rates of hyperkalemia increase with declining renal function .
[ See ADVERSE REACTIONS , 6 . 2 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings . ]
Patients with hypertension who have serum creatinine levels > 2 . 0 mg / dL ( males ) or > 1 . 8 mg / dL ( females ) or creatinine clearance ≤ 50 mL / min should not be treated with eplerenone [ See 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ] .
Patients with CHF post - MI who have serum creatinine levels > 2 . 0 mg / dL ( males ) or > 1 . 8 mg / dL ( females ) or creatinine clearance ≤ 50 mL / min should be treated with eplerenone with caution .
Diabetic patients with CHF post - MI should also be treated with caution , especially those with proteinuria .
The subset of patients in the EPHESUS study with both diabetes and proteinuria on the baseline urinalysis had increased rates of hyperkalemia compared to patients with either diabetes or proteinuria .
[ See ADVERSE REACTIONS , 6 . 2 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings . ]
5 . 2 Impaired Hepatic Function Mild - to - moderate hepatic impairment did not increase the incidence of hyperkalemia .
In 16 subjects with mild - to - moderate hepatic impairment who received 400 mg of eplerenone , no elevations of serum potassium above 5 . 5 mEq / L were observed .
The mean increase in serum potassium was 0 . 12 mEq / L in patients with hepatic impairment and 0 . 13 mEq / L in normal controls .
The use of eplerenone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been evaluated .
[ See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY . ]
5 . 3 Impaired Renal Function Patients with decreased renal function are at increased risk of hyperkalemia .
[ See 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , 5 . 1 Hyperkalemia , ADVERSE REACTIONS , 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience . ]
5 . 4 Allergic Reaction Eplerenone Tablets 50 mg contain FD & C Yellow No . 5 ( tartrazine ) which may cause allergic - type reactions ( including bronchial asthma ) in certain susceptible persons .
Although the overall incidence of FD & C Yellow No . 5 ( tartrazine ) sensitivity in the general population is low , it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling : • Hyperkalemia [ See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , 5 . 1 Hyperkalemia ] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
CHF Post - MI : Most common adverse reactions ( > 2 % and more frequent than with placebo ) : hyperkalemia and increased creatinine .
( 6 . 1 ) Hypertension : Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 2 % and more frequent than with placebo ) : dizziness , diarrhea , coughing , fatigue and flu - like symptoms .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Congestive Heart Failure Post - Myocardial Infarction In EPHESUS , safety was evaluated in 3 , 307 patients treated with eplerenone and 3 , 301 placebo - treated patients .
The overall incidence of adverse events reported with eplerenone ( 78 . 9 % ) was similar to placebo ( 79 . 5 % ) .
Adverse events occurred at a similar rate regardless of age , gender or race .
Patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event at similar rates in either treatment group ( 4 . 4 % eplerenone vs . 4 . 3 % placebo ) , with the most common reasons for discontinuation being hyperkalemia , myocardial infarction and abnormal renal function .
Adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in patients treated with eplerenone than placebo were hyperkalemia ( 3 . 4 % vs . 2 . 0 % ) and increased creatinine ( 2 . 4 % vs . 1 . 5 % ) .
Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia or abnormal renal function were less than 1 . 0 % in both groups .
Hypokalemia occurred less frequently in patients treated with eplerenone ( 0 . 6 % vs . 1 . 6 % ) .
The rates of sex hormone - related adverse events are shown in Table 2 .

A total of 690 patients were treated for over 6 months and 106 patients were treated for over 1 year .
In placebo - controlled studies , the overall rates of adverse events were 47 % with eplerenone and 45 % with placebo .
Adverse events occurred at a similar rate regardless of age , gender or race .
Therapy was discontinued due to an adverse event in 3 % of patients treated with eplerenone and 3 % of patients given placebo .
The most common reasons for discontinuation of eplerenone were headache , dizziness , angina pectoris / myocardial infarction and increased GGT .
The adverse events that were reported at a rate of at least 1 % of patients and at a higher rate in patients treated with eplerenone in daily doses of 25 mg to 400 mg versus placebo are shown in Table 3 .

Gynecomastia and abnormal vaginal bleeding were reported with eplerenone but not with placebo .
The rates of these sex hormone - related adverse events are shown in Table 4 .
The rates increased slightly with increasing duration of therapy .
In females , abnormal vaginal bleeding was also reported in 0 . 8 % of patients on antihypertensive medications ( other than spironolactone ) in active control arms of the studies with eplerenone .

In a study of such patients taking eplerenone 200 mg , the frequencies of maximum serum potassium levels > 5 . 5 mEq / L were 33 % with eplerenone given alone and 38 % when eplerenone was given with enalapril .
Rates of hyperkalemia increased with decreasing renal function .
In all studies , serum potassium elevations > 5 . 5 mEq / L were observed in 10 . 4 % of patients treated with eplerenone with baseline calculated creatinine clearance < 70 mL / min , 5 . 6 % of patients with baseline creatinine clearance of 70 mL / min to 100 mL / min and 2 . 6 % of patients with baseline creatinine clearance of > 100 mL / min .
[ See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , 5 . 1 Hyperkalemia . ]
Sodium : Serum sodium decreased in a dose - related manner .
Mean decreases ranged from 0 . 7 mEq / L at 50 mg daily to 1 . 7 mEq / L at 400 mg daily .
Decreases in sodium ( < 135 mEq / L ) were reported for 2 . 3 % of patients administered eplerenone and 0 . 6 % of placebo - treated patients .
Triglycerides : Serum triglycerides increased in a dose - related manner .
Mean increases ranged from 7 . 1 mg / dL at 50 mg daily to 26 . 6 mg / dL at 400 mg daily .
Increases in triglycerides ( above 252 mg / dL ) were reported for 15 % of patients administered eplerenone and 12 % of placebo - treated patients .
Cholesterol : Serum cholesterol increased in a dose - related manner .
Mean changes ranged from a decrease of 0 . 4 mg / dL at 50 mg daily to an increase of 11 . 6 mg / dL at 400 mg daily .
Increases in serum cholesterol values greater than 200 mg / dL were reported for 0 . 3 % of patients administered eplerenone and 0 % of placebo - treated patients .
Liver Function Tests : Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT ) increased in a dose - related manner .
Mean increases ranged from 0 . 8 U / L at 50 mg daily to 4 . 8 U / L at 400 mg daily for ALT and 3 . 1 U / L at 50 mg daily to 11 . 3 U / L at 400 mg daily for GGT .
Increases in ALT levels greater than 120 U / L ( 3 times upper limit of normal ) were reported for 15 / 2 , 259 patients administered eplerenone and 1 / 351 placebo - treated patients .
Increases in ALT levels greater than 200 U / L ( 5 times upper limit of normal ) were reported for 5 / 2 , 259 of patients administered eplerenone and 1 / 351 placebo - treated patients .
Increases of ALT greater than 120 U / L and bilirubin greater than 1 . 2 mg / dL were reported 1 / 2 , 259 patients administered eplerenone and 0 / 351 placebo - treated patients .
Hepatic failure was not reported in patients receiving eplerenone .
BUN / Creatinine : Serum creatinine increased in a dose - related manner .
Mean increases ranged from 0 . 01 mg / dL at 50 mg daily to 0 . 03 mg / dL at 400 mg daily .
Increases in blood urea nitrogen to greater than 30 mg / dL and serum creatinine to greater than 2 mg / dL were reported for 0 . 5 % and 0 . 2 % , respectively , of patients administered eplerenone and 0 % of placebo - treated patients .
Uric Acid : Increases in uric acid to greater than 9 mg / dL were reported in 0 . 3 % of patients administered eplerenone and 0 % of placebo - treated patients .
6 . 3 Post - Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of eplerenone .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Skin : angioneurotic edema , rash 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Reduce the starting dose for hypertension to 25 mg once daily when used with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , verapamil , erythromycin , saquinavir , fluconazole ) .
( 2 . 4 , 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Because eplerenone metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP3A4 , do not use eplerenone with drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 .
[ See 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics . ]
In patients with hypertension taking moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors , reduce the starting dose of eplerenone to 25 mg once daily .
[ See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , 2 . 4 Dose Modifications for Specific Populations ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics . ]
7 . 2 ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists Congestive Heart Failure Post - Myocardial Infarction In EPHESUS [ see CLINICAL STUDIES , 14 . 1 Congestive Heart Failure Post - Myocardial Infarction ] , 3 , 020 ( 91 % ) patients receiving eplerenone 25 mg to 50 mg also received ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists ( ACEI / ARB ) .
Rates of patients with maximum potassium levels > 5 . 5 mEq / L were similar regardless of the use of ACEI / ARB .
Hypertension In clinical studies of patients with hypertension , the addition of eplerenone 50 mg to 100 mg to ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists increased mean serum potassium slightly ( about 0 . 09 mEq / L to 0 . 13 mEq / L ) .
In a study in diabetics with microalbuminuria , eplerenone 200 mg combined with the ACE inhibitor enalapril 10 mg increased the frequency of hyperkalemia ( serum potassium > 5 . 5 mEq / L ) from 17 % on enalapril alone to 38 % .
7 . 3 Lithium A drug interaction study of eplerenone with lithium has not been conducted .
Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with diuretics and ACE inhibitors .
Serum lithium levels should be monitored frequently if eplerenone is administered concomitantly with lithium .
7 . 4 Nonsteroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) A drug interaction study of eplerenone with an NSAID has not been conducted .
The administration of other potassium - sparing antihypertensives with NSAIDs has been shown to reduce the antihypertensive effect in some patients and result in severe hyperkalemia in patients with impaired renal function .
Therefore , when eplerenone and NSAIDs are used concomitantly , patients should be observed to determine whether the desired effect on blood pressure is obtained and monitored for changes in serum potassium levels .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Eplerenone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Teratogenic Effects Embryo - fetal development studies were conducted with doses up to 1000 mg / kg / day in rats and 300 mg / kg / day in rabbits ( exposures up to 32 and 31 times the human AUC for the 100 - mg / day therapeutic dose , respectively ) .
No teratogenic effects were seen in rats or rabbits , although decreased body weight in maternal rabbits and increased rabbit fetal resorptions and post - implantation loss were observed at the highest administered dosage .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , eplerenone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers The concentration of eplerenone in human breast milk after oral administration is unknown .
However , preclinical data show that eplerenone and / or metabolites are present in rat breast milk ( 0 . 85 : 1 [ milk : plasma ] AUC ratio ) obtained after a single oral dose .
Peak concentrations in plasma and milk were obtained from 0 . 5 to 1 hour after dosing .
Rat pups exposed by this route developed normally .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the unknown potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use In a 10 - week study of 304 hypertensive pediatric patients age 4 to 17 years treated with eplerenone up to 100 mg per day , doses that produced exposure similar to that in adults , eplerenone did not lower blood pressure effectively .
In this study and in a 1 - year pediatric safety study in 149 patients , the incidence of reported adverse events was similar to that of adults .
Eplerenone has not been studied in hypertensive patients less than 4 years old because the study in older pediatric patients did not demonstrate effectiveness .
Eplerenone has not been studied in pediatric patients with heart failure .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Congestive Heart Failure Post - Myocardial Infarction Of the total number of patients in EPHESUS , 3 , 340 ( 50 % ) were 65 and over , while 1 , 326 ( 20 % ) were 75 and over .
Patients greater than 75 years did not appear to benefit from the use of eplerenone .
[ See CLINICAL STUDIES , 14 . 1 Congestive Heart Failure Post - Myocardial Infarction . ]
No differences in overall incidence of adverse events were observed between elderly and younger patients .
However , due to age - related decreases in creatinine clearance , the incidence of laboratory - documented hyperkalemia was increased in patients 65 and older .
[ See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , 5 . 1 Hyperkalemia . ]
Hypertension Of the total number of subjects in clinical hypertension studies of eplerenone , 1 , 123 ( 23 % ) were 65 and over , while 212 ( 4 % ) were 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly subjects and younger subjects .
10 OVERDOSAGE No cases of human overdosage with eplerenone have been reported .
Lethality was not observed in mice , rats or dogs after single oral doses that provided Cmax exposures at least 25 times higher than in humans receiving eplerenone 100 mg / day .
Dogs showed emesis , salivation and tremors at a Cmax 41 times the human therapeutic Cmax , progressing to sedation and convulsions at higher exposures .
The most likely manifestation of human overdosage would be anticipated to be hypotension or hyperkalemia .
Eplerenone cannot be removed by hemodialysis .
Eplerenone has been shown to bind extensively to charcoal .
If symptomatic hypotension should occur , supportive treatment should be instituted .
If hyperkalemia develops , standard treatment should be initiated .
11 DESCRIPTION Eplerenone tablets contains eplerenone , a blocker of aldosterone binding at the mineralocorticoid receptor .
Eplerenone is chemically described as Pregn - 4 - ene - 7 , 21 - dicarboxylic acid , 9 , 11 - epoxy - 17 - hydroxy - 3 - oxo - , γ - lactone , methyl ester , ( 7α , 11α , 17α ) - .
Its empirical formula is C24H30O6 and it has a molecular weight of 414 . 50 .
The structural formula of eplerenone is represented below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Eplerenone is an odorless , white to off - white crystalline powder .
It is very slightly soluble in water , with its solubility essentially pH independent .
The octanol / water partition coefficient of eplerenone is approximately 7 . 1 at pH 7 . 0 .
Eplerenone tablets for oral administration contains 25 mg or 50 mg of eplerenone and the following inactive ingredients : lactose monohydrate , silicified microcrystalline cellulose , croscarmellose sodium , hypromellose , talc , magnesium stearate , titanium dioxide , polyethylene glycol .
In addition , the 25 mg tablets also contain polysorbate and the 50 mg tablets also contain FD & C yellow No . 5 ( tartrazine ) and FD & C yellow No . 6 , polydextrose and triacetin .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Eplerenone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and blocks the binding of aldosterone , a component of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone - system ( RAAS ) .
Aldosterone synthesis , which occurs primarily in the adrenal gland , is modulated by multiple factors , including angiotensin II and non - RAAS mediators such as adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) and potassium .
Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in both epithelial ( e . g . , kidney ) and nonepithelial ( e . g . , heart , blood vessels and brain ) tissues and increases blood pressure through induction of sodium reabsorption and possibly other mechanisms .
Eplerenone has been shown to produce sustained increases in plasma renin and serum aldosterone , consistent with inhibition of the negative regulatory feedback of aldosterone on renin secretion .
The resulting increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone circulating levels do not overcome the effects of eplerenone .
Eplerenone selectively binds to recombinant human mineralocorticoid receptors relative to its binding to recombinant human glucocorticoid , progesterone and androgen receptors .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Eplerenone is cleared predominantly by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 metabolism , with an elimination half - life of 4 to 6 hours .
Steady state is reached within 2 days .
Absorption is not affected by food .
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e . g . , ketoconazole , saquinavir ) increase blood levels of eplerenone .
Absorption and Distribution Mean peak plasma concentrations of eplerenone are reached approximately 1 . 5 hours following oral administration .
The absolute bioavailability of eplerenone is 69 % following administration of a 100 mg oral tablet .
Both peak plasma levels ( Cmax ) and area under the curve ( AUC ) are dose proportional for doses of 25 mg to 100 mg and less than proportional at doses above 100 mg .
The plasma protein binding of eplerenone is about 50 % and it is primarily bound to alpha 1 - acid glycoproteins .
The apparent volume of distribution at steady state ranged from 43 L to 90 L . Eplerenone does not preferentially bind to red blood cells .
Metabolism and Excretion Eplerenone metabolism is primarily mediated via CYP3A4 .
No active metabolites of eplerenone have been identified in human plasma .
Less than 5 % of an eplerenone dose is recovered as unchanged drug in the urine and feces .
Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled drug , approximately 32 % of the dose was excreted in the feces and approximately 67 % was excreted in the urine .
The elimination half - life of eplerenone is approximately 4 to 6 hours .
The apparent plasma clearance is approximately 10 L / hr .
Age , Gender and Race The pharmacokinetics of eplerenone at a dose of 100 mg once daily has been investigated in the elderly ( ≥ 65 years ) , in males and females and in Blacks .
At steady state , elderly subjects had increases in Cmax ( 22 % ) and AUC ( 45 % ) compared with younger subjects ( 18 to 45 years ) .
The pharmacokinetics of eplerenone did not differ significantly between males and females .
At steady state , Cmax was 19 % lower and AUC was 26 % lower in Blacks .
[ See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , 2 . 4 Dose Modifications for Specific Populations and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS , 8 . 5 Geriatric Use . ]
Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of eplerenone was evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment and in patients undergoing hemodialysis .
Compared with control subjects , steady - state AUC and Cmax were increased by 38 % and 24 % , respectively , in patients with severe renal impairment and were decreased by 26 % and 3 % , respectively , in patients undergoing hemodialysis .
No correlation was observed between plasma clearance of eplerenone and creatinine clearance .
Eplerenone is not removed by hemodialysis .
[ See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , 5 . 3 Impaired Renal Function . ]
Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of eplerenone 400 mg has been investigated in patients with moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment and compared with normal subjects .
Steady - state Cmax and AUC of eplerenone were increased by 3 . 6 % and 42 % , respectively .
Heart Failure The pharmacokinetics of eplerenone 50 mg was evaluated in 8 patients with heart failure ( NYHA classification II – IV ) and 8 matched ( gender , age , weight ) healthy controls .
Compared with the controls , steady state AUC and Cmax in patients with stable heart failure were 38 % and 30 % higher , respectively .
Drug - Drug Interactions [ See 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS . ]
Eplerenone is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 .
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 cause increased exposure [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS , 7 . 1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors ] .
Drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with a 100 mg dose of eplerenone .
A pharmacokinetic study evaluating the administration of a single dose of eplerenone 100 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg two times a day , a strong inhibitor of the CYP3A4 pathway , showed a 1 . 7 - fold increase in Cmax of eplerenone and a 5 . 4 - fold increase in AUC of eplerenone .
Administration of eplerenone with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , erythromycin 500 mg BID , verapamil 240 mg once daily , saquinavir 1200 mg three times a day , fluconazole 200 mg once daily ) resulted in increases in Cmax of eplerenone ranging from 1 . 4 - to 1 . 6 - fold and AUC from 2 . 0 - to 2 . 9 - fold .
Grapefruit juice caused only a small increase ( about 25 % ) in exposure .
Eplerenone is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , CYP3A4 , CYP2C19 , CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 .
Eplerenone did not inhibit the metabolism of amiodarone , amlodipine , astemizole , chlorzoxazone , cisapride , dexamethasone , dextromethorphan , diclofenac , 17α - ethinyl estradiol , fluoxetine , losartan , lovastatin , mephobarbital , methylphenidate , methylprednisolone , metoprolol , midazolam , nifedipine , phenacetin , phenytoin , simvastatin , tolbutamide , triazolam , verapamil and warfarin in vitro .
Eplerenone is not a substrate or an inhibitor of P - Glycoprotein at clinically relevant doses .
No clinically significant drug - drug pharmacokinetic interactions were observed when eplerenone was administered with cisapride , cyclosporine , digoxin , glyburide , midazolam , oral contraceptives ( norethindrone / ethinyl estradiol ) , simvastatin or warfarin .
St . John ' s Wort ( a CYP3A4 inducer ) caused a small ( about 30 % ) decrease in eplerenone AUC .
No significant changes in eplerenone pharmacokinetics were observed when eplerenone was administered with aluminum - and magnesium - containing antacids .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Eplerenone was non - genotoxic in a battery of assays including in vitro bacterial mutagenesis ( Ames test in Salmonella spp .
and E . Coli ) , in vitro mammalian cell mutagenesis ( mouse lymphoma cells ) , in vitro chromosomal aberration ( Chinese hamster ovary cells ) , in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus formation and in vivo / ex vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver .
There was no drug - related tumor response in heterozygous P53 deficient mice when tested for 6 months at dosages up to 1000 mg / kg / day ( systemic AUC exposures up to 9 times the exposure in humans receiving the 100 mg / day therapeutic dose ) .
Statistically significant increases in benign thyroid tumors were observed after 2 years in both male and female rats when administered eplerenone 250 mg / kg / day ( highest dose tested ) and in male rats only at 75 mg / kg / day .
These dosages provided systemic AUC exposures approximately 2 to 12 times higher than the average human therapeutic exposure at 100 mg / day .
Repeat dose administration of eplerenone to rats increases the hepatic conjugation and clearance of thyroxin , which results in increased levels of TSH by a compensatory mechanism .
Drugs that have produced thyroid tumors by this rodent - specific mechanism have not shown a similar effect in humans .
Male rats treated with eplerenone at 1000 mg / kg / day for 10 weeks ( AUC 17 times that at the 100 mg / day human therapeutic dose ) had decreased weights of seminal vesicles and epididymides and slightly decreased fertility .
Dogs administered eplerenone at dosages of 15 mg / kg / day and higher ( AUC 5 times that at the 100 mg / day human therapeutic dose ) had dose - related prostate atrophy .
The prostate atrophy was reversible after daily treatment for 1 year at 100 mg / kg / day .
Dogs with prostate atrophy showed no decline in libido , sexual performance or semen quality .
Testicular weight and histology were not affected by eplerenone in any test animal species at any dosage .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Congestive Heart Failure Post - Myocardial Infarction The eplerenone post - acute myocardial infarction heart failure efficacy and survival study ( EPHESUS ) was a multinational , multicenter , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study in patients clinically stable 3 to 14 days after an acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) with left ventricular dysfunction ( as measured by left ventricular ejection fraction [ LVEF ] ≤ 40 % ) and either diabetes or clinical evidence of congestive heart failure ( CHF ) ( pulmonary congestion by exam or chest x - ray or S3 ) .
Patients with CHF of valvular or congenital etiology , patients with unstable post - infarct angina and patients with serum potassium > 5 . 0 mEq / L or serum creatinine > 2 . 5 mg / dL were to be excluded .
Patients were allowed to receive standard post - MI drug therapy and to undergo revascularization by angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery .
Patients randomized to eplerenone were given an initial dose of 25 mg once daily and titrated to the target dose of 50 mg once daily after 4 weeks if serum potassium was < 5 . 0 mEq / L .
Dosage was reduced or suspended anytime during the study if serum potassium levels were ≥ 5 . 5 mEq / L .
[ See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , 2 . 1 Congestive Heart Failure Post - Myocardial Infarction . ]
EPHESUS randomized 6 , 632 patients ( 9 . 3 % U . S . ) at 671 centers in 27 countries .
The study population was primarily white ( 90 % , with 1 % Black , 1 % Asian , 6 % Hispanic , 2 % other ) and male ( 71 % ) .
The mean age was 64 years ( range , 22 to 94 years ) .
The majority of patients had pulmonary congestion ( 75 % ) by exam or x - ray and were Killip Class II ( 64 % ) .
The mean ejection fraction was 33 % .
The average time to enrollment was 7 days post - MI .
Medical histories prior to the index MI included hypertension ( 60 % ) , coronary artery disease ( 62 % ) , dyslipidemia ( 48 % ) , angina ( 41 % ) , type 2 diabetes ( 30 % ) , previous MI ( 27 % ) and CHF ( 15 % ) .
The mean dose of eplerenone was 43 mg / day .
Patients also received standard care including aspirin ( 92 % ) , ACE inhibitors ( 90 % ) , ß - blockers ( 83 % ) , nitrates ( 72 % ) , loop diuretics ( 66 % ) or HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors ( 60 % ) .
Patients were followed for an average of 16 months ( range , 0 to 33 months ) .
The ascertainment rate for vital status was 99 . 7 % .
The co - primary endpoints for EPHESUS were ( 1 ) the time to death from any cause and ( 2 ) the time to first occurrence of either cardiovascular ( CV ) mortality [ defined as sudden cardiac death or death due to progression of congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , stroke or other CV causes ] or CV hospitalization ( defined as hospitalization for progression of CHF , ventricular arrhythmias , acute myocardial infarction or stroke ) .
For the co - primary endpoint for death from any cause , there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group ( 14 . 4 % ) and 554 deaths in the placebo group ( 16 . 7 % ) .
The risk of death with eplerenone was reduced by 15 % [ hazard ratio equal to 0 . 85 ( 95 % confidence interval 0 . 75 to 0 . 96 ; p = 0 . 008 by log rank test ) ] .
Kaplan - Meier estimates of all - cause mortality are shown in Figure 1 and the components of mortality are provided in Table 9 .
Figure 1 : Kaplan - Meier Estimates of All - Cause Mortality [ MULTIMEDIA ] Table 9 : Components of All - Cause Mortality in EPHESUS Eplerenone ( N = 3 , 319 ) n ( % ) Placebo ( N = 3 , 313 ) n ( % ) Hazard Ratio p - value Death from any cause 478 ( 14 . 4 ) 554 ( 16 . 7 ) 0 . 85 0 . 008 CV Death 407 ( 12 . 3 ) 483 ( 14 . 6 ) 0 . 83 0 . 005 Non - CV Death 60 ( 1 . 8 ) 54 ( 1 . 6 ) Unknown or unwitnessed death 11 ( 0 . 3 ) 17 ( 0 . 5 ) Most CV deaths were attributed to sudden death , acute MI and CHF .
The time to first event for the co - primary endpoint of CV death or hospitalization as defined above , was longer in the eplerenone group ( hazard ratio 0 . 87 , 95 % confidence interval 0 . 79 to 0 . 95 , p = 0 . 002 ) .
An analysis that included the time to first occurrence of CV mortality and all CV hospitalizations ( atrial arrhythmia , angina , CV procedures , progression of CHF , MI , stroke , ventricular arrhythmia or other CV causes ) showed a smaller effect with a hazard ratio of 0 . 92 ( 95 % confidence interval 0 . 86 to 0 . 99 ; p = 0 . 028 ) .
The combined endpoints , including combined all - cause hospitalization and mortality were driven primarily by CV mortality .
The combined endpoints in EPHESUS , including all - cause hospitalization and all - cause mortality , are presented in Table 10 .

Mortality hazard ratios appeared favorable for eplerenone for both genders and for all races or ethnic groups , although the numbers of non - caucasians were low ( 648 , 10 % ) .
Patients with diabetes without clinical evidence of CHF and patients greater than 75 years did not appear to benefit from the use of eplerenone .
Such subgroup analyses must be interpreted cautiously .
Figure 2 : Hazard Ratios of All - Cause Mortality by Subgroups [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Analyses conducted for a variety of CV biomarkers did not confirm a mechanism of action by which mortality was reduced .
14 . 2 Hypertension The safety and efficacy of eplerenone have been evaluated alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents in clinical studies of 3 , 091 hypertensive patients .
The studies included 46 % women , 14 % blacks and 22 % elderly ( age ≥ 65 ) .
The studies excluded patients with elevated baseline serum potassium ( > 5 . 0 mEq / L ) and elevated baseline serum creatinine ( generally > 1 . 5 mg / dL in males and > 1 . 3 mg / dL in females ) .
Two fixed - dose , placebo - controlled , 8 - to 12 - week monotherapy studies in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 mm Hg to 114 mm Hg were conducted to assess the antihypertensive effect of eplerenone .
In these two studies , 611 patients were randomized to eplerenone and 140 patients to placebo .
Patients received eplerenone in doses of 25 mg to 400 mg daily as either a single daily dose or divided into two daily doses .
The mean placebo - subtracted reductions in trough cuff blood pressure achieved by eplerenone in these studies at doses up to 200 mg are shown in Figures 3 and 4 .
Figure 3 : Eplerenone Dose Response - Trough Cuff SBP Placebo - Subtracted Adjusted Mean Change from Baseline in Hypertension Studies [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 4 : Eplerenone Dose Response - Trough Cuff DBP Placebo - Subtracted Adjusted Mean Change from Baseline in Hypertension Studies [ MULTIMEDIA ] Patients treated with eplerenone 50 mg to 200 mg daily experienced significant decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure at trough with differences from placebo of 6 mm Hg to 13 mm Hg ( systolic ) and 3 mm Hg to 7 mm Hg ( diastolic ) .
These effects were confirmed by assessments with 24 - hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) .
In these studies , assessments of 24 - hour ABPM data demonstrated that eplerenone , administered once or twice daily , maintained antihypertensive efficacy over the entire dosing interval .
However , at a total daily dose of 100 mg , eplerenone administered as 50 mg twice per day produced greater trough cuff ( 4 / 3 mm Hg ) and ABPM ( 2 / 1 mm Hg ) blood pressure reductions than 100 mg given once daily .
Blood pressure lowering was apparent within 2 weeks from the start of therapy with eplerenone , with maximal antihypertensive effects achieved within 4 weeks .
Stopping eplerenone following treatment for 8 to 24 weeks in six studies did not lead to adverse event rates in the week following withdrawal of eplerenone greater than following placebo or active control withdrawal .
Blood pressures in patients not taking other antihypertensives rose 1 week after withdrawal of eplerenone by about 6 / 3 mm Hg , suggesting that the antihypertensive effect of eplerenone was maintained through 8 to 24 weeks .
Blood pressure reductions with eplerenone in the two fixed - dose monotherapy studies and other studies using titrated doses , as well as concomitant treatments , were not significantly different when analyzed by age , gender or race with one exception .
In a study in patients with low renin hypertension , blood pressure reductions in blacks were smaller than those in whites during the initial titration period with eplerenone .
Eplerenone has been studied concomitantly with treatment with ACE inhibitors , angiotensin II receptor antagonists , calcium channel blockers , beta blockers and hydrochlorothiazide .
When administered concomitantly with one of these drugs , eplerenone usually produced its expected antihypertensive effects .
There was no significant change in average heart rate among patients treated with eplerenone in the combined clinical studies .
No consistent effects of eplerenone on heart rate , QRS duration or PR or QT interval were observed in 147 normal subjects evaluated for electrocardiographic changes during pharmacokinetic studies .
