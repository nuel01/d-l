8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on oxymetazoline hydrochloride use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage .
A literature article describing intranasal decongestant use in pregnant women identified a potential association between second - trimester exposure to oxymetazoline ( with no decongestant exposure in the first trimester ) and renal collecting system anomalies [ see Data ] .
In animal reproduction studies , there were no adverse developmental effects observed after oral administration of oxymetazoline hydrochloride in pregnant rats and rabbits at systemic exposures up to 3 times and 73 times , respectively , the exposure associated with the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions Following repeated use of oxymetazoline hydrochloride solution nasal spray for the treatment of nasal congestion at a dose 5 times higher than recommended , one case of fetal distress was reported in a 41 - week pregnant patient .
The fetal distress resolved hours later , prior to the delivery of the healthy infant .
The anticipated exposures for the case are 8 - to 18 - fold higher than plasma exposures after topical administration of oxymetazoline hydrochloride .
Data Human Data No adequate and well - controlled trials of oxymetazoline hydrochloride have been conducted in pregnant women .
Across all clinical trials of oxymetazoline hydrochloride , two pregnancies were reported .
One pregnancy resulted in the delivery of a healthy child .
One pregnancy resulted in a spontaneous abortion , which was considered to be unrelated to the trial medication .
A literature article summarizing the results of exploratory analyses of intranasal decongestant use during pregnancy identified a potential association between second - trimester exposure to oxymetazoline hydrochloride solution ( with no decongestant exposure in the first trimester ) and renal collecting system anomalies .
Animal Data Effects on embryo - fetal development were evaluated in rats and rabbits following oral administration of oxymetazoline hydrochloride during the period of organogenesis .
Oxymetazoline hydrochloride did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at oral doses up to 0 . 2 mg / kg / day in pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis ( 3 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis ) .
Oxymetazoline hydrochloride did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at oral doses up to 1 mg / kg / day in pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis ( 73 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis ) .
Maternal toxicity , such as decreased maternal body weight , was produced at the high dose of 1 mg / kg / day in pregnant rabbits and was associated with findings of delayed skeletal ossification .
In a rat perinatal and postnatal development study , oxymetazoline hydrochloride was orally administered to pregnant rats once daily from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20 .
Maternal toxicity was produced at the high dose of 0 . 2 mg / kg / day ( 3 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis ) in pregnant rats and was associated with an increase in pup mortality and reduced pup body weights .
Delayed sexual maturation was noted at 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 mg / kg / day ( 2 times the MRHD and 3 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis , respectively ) .
Oxymetazoline hydrochloride did not have any adverse effects on fetal development at a dose of 0 . 05 mg / kg / day ( one - half of the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis ) .
8 . 2 Lactation No clinical data are available to assess the effects of oxymetazoline on the quantity or rate of breastmilk production , or to establish the level of oxymetazoline present in human breastmilk post - dose .
Oxymetazoline was detected in the milk of lactating rats .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for oxymetazoline hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from oxymetazoline hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of oxymetazoline hydrochloride have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use One hundred and ninety - three subjects aged 65 years and older received treatment with oxymetazoline hydrochloride ( n = 135 ) or vehicle ( n = 58 ) in clinical trials .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects ≥ 65 years of age and younger subjects , based on available data .
Clinical studies of oxymetazoline hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
10 OVERDOSAGE Oxymetazoline hydrochloride is not for oral use .
If oral ingestion occurs , seek medical advice .
Monitor patient closely and administer appropriate supportive measures as necessary .
Accidental ingestion of topical solutions ( nasal sprays ) containing imidazoline derivatives ( e . g . , oxymetazoline ) in children has resulted in serious adverse events requiring hospitalization , including nausea , vomiting , lethargy , tachycardia , decreased respiration , bradycardia , hypotension , hypertension , sedation , somnolence , mydriasis , stupor , hypothermia , drooling , and coma .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Oxymetazoline is an alpha1A adrenoceptor agonist .
Oxymetazoline acts as a vasoconstrictor .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of oxymetazoline hydrochloride has not been studied .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of oxymetazoline was evaluated following topical administration of oxymetazoline hydrochloride in a thin layer to cover the entire face in adult subjects with erythema associated with rosacea .
The median weight of cream for each dose administration was 0 . 3 g . Plasma oxymetazoline concentrations were measurable in most of the subjects .
Following the first dose application , the mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) peak concentrations ( Cmax ) and area under the concentration - time curves from time 0 to 24 hours ( AUC0 - 24 hr ) were 60 . 5 ± 53 . 9 pg / mL and 895 ± 798 pg * hr / mL , respectively .

Distribution An in vitro study demonstrated that oxymetazoline is 56 . 7 % to 57 . 5 % bound to human plasma proteins .
Metabolism In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that oxymetazoline was minimally metabolized , generating mono - oxygenated and dehydrogenated products of oxymetazoline .
The percentage of parent drug oxymetazoline remaining was 95 . 9 % after a 120 - minute incubation with human liver microsomes .
Excretion The excretion of oxymetazoline following administration of oxymetazoline hydrochloride has not been characterized in humans .
Drug Interaction In vitro studies using human liver microsomes demonstrated that oxymetazoline up to the tested concentration of 100 nM had no inhibition on the activities of the cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) isoenzymes 1A2 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , and 3A4 / 5 .
Treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with up to 100 nM oxymetazoline did not induce CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , or CYP3A4 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Oxymetazoline hydrochloride was not associated with an increased incidence of neoplastic or proliferative changes in transgenic mice given oral doses of 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , or 2 . 5 mg / kg / day oxymetazoline hydrochloride for 6 months .
Oxymetazoline hydrochloride revealed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests ( Ames assay and human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay ) and one in vivo gentoxicity test ( mouse micronucleus assay ) .
Effects on fertility and early embryonic development were evaluated in rats following oral administration of 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , or 0 . 2 mg / kg / day oxymetazoline hydrochloride prior to and during mating and through early pregnancy .
Decreased number of corpora lutea and increased post - implantation losses were noted at 0 . 2 mg / kg / day oxymetazoline hydrochloride ( 3 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis ) .
However , no treatment related effects on fertility or mating parameters were noted at 0 . 2 mg / kg / day oxymetazoline hydrochloride ( 3 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxymetazoline hydrochloride was evaluated for the treatment of persistent erythema associated with rosacea in two identical , randomized , double - blind , vehicle - controlled , parallel - group clinical trials .
The trials enrolled 885 subjects aged 18 years and older .
Overall , 90 % of subjects were Caucasian and 79 % were female .
Subjects applied either oxymetazoline hydrochloride or vehicle once daily for 29 days .
Disease severity was graded by the clinician using a 5 - point clinician erythema assessment ( CEA ) scale and by the subject on a similar 5 - point subject self - assessment ( SSA ) scale , on which subjects scored either " moderate " or " severe " on both scales .
CEA and SSA were measured over a 12 - hour period at equally - spaced timepoints ( hours 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 ) post - dose on Days 1 , 15 , and 29 .
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects with at least a 2 - grade reduction in erythema ( improvement ) from baseline ( pre - dose on Day 1 ) on both the CEA and SSA measured at hours 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 on Day 29 .
The results from both trials on the composite endpoint for Day 29 are presented in Table 2 .
