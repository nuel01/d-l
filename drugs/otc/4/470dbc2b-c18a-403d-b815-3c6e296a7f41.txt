( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Schedule - Dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine , prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically signiﬁcant hypotension , severe ﬂu - like symptoms , myelosuppression , and asthenia .
The half - life of gemcitabine is inﬂuenced by the length of the infusion [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Refer to the recommended Gemcitabine Injection dosage [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , and anemia , occurs with gemcitabine as a singleagent and the risks are increased when gemcitabine is combined with other cytotoxic drugs .
In clinical trials , Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia , anemia , and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25 % , 8 % , and 5 % , respectively of the 979 patients who received single agent gemcitabine .
The frequencies of Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia , anemia , and thrombocytopenia varied from 48 % to 71 % , 8 % to 28 % , and 5 % to 55 % , respectively , in patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with another drug [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Prior to each dose of Gemcitabine Injection , obtain a complete blood count ( CBC ) with a differential and a platelet count .
Modify the dosage as recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity , including interstitial pneumonitis , pulmonary ﬁbrosis , pulmonary edema , and adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , has been reported .
In some cases , these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite the discontinuation of therapy .
The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of gemcitabine [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 ) ] .
Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine Injection in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea , with or without bronchospasm , or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity .
5 . 4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUS ) , including fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis , can occur with gemcitabine .
In clinical trials , HUS occurred in 0 . 25 % of 2429 patients .

Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine Injection in patients who develop severe hepatic toxicity .
5 . 6 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on animal data and its mechanism of action Gemcitabine Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Gemcitabine was teratogenic , embryotoxic , and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Gemcitabine Injection and for 6 months after the ﬁnal dose .
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Gemcitabine Injection and for 3 months following the ﬁnal dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine is not recommended for use in combination with radiation therapy .
Concurrent ( given together or ≤ 7 days apart ) Life - threatening mucositis , especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1000 mg / m ² to patients with non - small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation .

The incidence of febrile neutropenia ( 3 % versus < 1 % ) , sepsis ( 4 % versus 1 % ) , Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias ( 3 % versus < 1 % ) were all higher in the gemcitabine / cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm .
The two - drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 ( 1 . 5 % ) possibly treatment - related deaths , including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection .
No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identiﬁed during post - approval use of gemcitabine .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and Lymphatic System : TMA Cardiovascular : Congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , arrhythmias , supraventricular arrhythmias .
Vascular : Peripheral vasculitis , gangrene , capillary leak syndrome .
Skin : Cellulitis , pseudocellulitis , severe skin reactions , including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions .
Hepatic : Hepatic failure , hepatic veno - occlusive disease .
Pulmonary : Interstitial pneumonitis , pulmonary ﬁbrosis , pulmonary eosinophilia , pulmonary edema , adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) Nervous System : Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) 8 .
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal data and its mechanism of action , Gemcitabine Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on the use of gemcitabine in pregnant women .
In animal reproduction studies , gemcitabine was teratogenic , embryotoxic , and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [ see Use in Speciﬁc Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Gemcitabine is embryotoxic in mice .
Daily dosing of gemcitabine to pregnant mice increased the incidence of fetal malformations ( cleft palate , incomplete ossiﬁcation ) at doses of 1 . 5 mg / kg / day [ about0 . 005 times the 1000 mg / m ² clinical dose based on body surface area ( BSA ) ] .
Gemcitabine is embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rabbits .
Daily dosing of gemcitabine to pregnant rabbits resulted in fetotoxicity ( decreased fetal viability , reduced litter sizes and developmental delays ) and increased the incidence of fetal malformations ( fused pulmonary artery , absence of gall bladder ) at doses of 0 . 1 mg / kg / day ( about 0 . 002 times the 1000 mg / m ² clinical dose based on BSA ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of gemcitabine or its metabolites in human milk , or their effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Gemcitabine Injection and for at least one week following the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Gemcitabine Injection [ see Use in Speciﬁc Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Gemcitabine Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Speciﬁc Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females Because of the potential for genotoxicity , advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Gemcitabine Injection and for 6 months after the ﬁnal dose .
Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Gemcitabine Injection and for 3 months after the ﬁnal dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Males Based on animal studies , gemcitabine may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of gemcitabine have not been established in pediatric patients .
The safety and pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine were evaluated in a trial in pediatric patients with refractory leukemia .
The maximum tolerated dose was 10 mg / m ² / min for 360 minutes weekly for three weeks followed by a one - week rest period .
The safety and activity of gemcitabine were evaluated in a trial of pediatric patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( 22 patients ) and acute myelogenous leukemia ( 10 patients ) at a dose of10 mg / m ² / min administered over 360 minutes weekly for three weeks followed by a one - week rest period .
Patients with M1 or M2 bone marrow on Day 28 who did not experience unacceptable toxicity were eligible to receive a maximum of one additional four - week course .
Toxicities observed included myelosuppression , febrile neutropenia , increased serum transaminases , nausea , and rash / desquamation .
No meaningful clinical activity was observed in this trial .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies which enrolled 979 patients with various malignancies who received single agent gemcitabine , no overall differences in safety were observed between patients aged 65 and older and younger patients , with the exception of a higher rate of Grade 3 - 4 thrombocytopenia in older patients as compared to younger patients .
In a randomized trial in women with ovarian cancer ( Study 1 ) , 175 women received gemcitabine with carboplatin , of which 29 % were age 65 years or older .
Similar effectiveness was observed between older and younger women .
There was signiﬁcantly higher Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia in women 65 years of age or older [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Gemcitabine clearance is affected by age , however there are no recommended dose adjustments based on patients ' age [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Gender Gemcitabine clearance is decreased in females [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In single agent studies of gemcitabine , women , especially older women , were more likely not to proceed to a subsequent cycle and to experience Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for overdoses of gemcitabine .
Myelosuppression , paresthesias , and severe rash were the principal toxicities seen when a single dose as high as 5700 mg / m ² was administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks to several patients in a dose - escalation study .
In the event of suspected overdose , monitor with appropriate blood counts and provide supportive therapy , as necessary .
11 DESCRIPTION Gemcitabine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor .
The chemical name of gemcitabine HCl is 2 ´ - deoxy - 2 ´ , 2 ´ diﬂuorocytidine monohydrochloride ( β - isomer ) .
The structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Gemcitabine HCl is a white to off - white solid with a molecular formula of C9H11F2N3O4 • HCl and a molecular weight of 299 . 66 g / mol .
It is soluble in water , slightly soluble in methanol , and practically insoluble in ethanol and polar organic solvents .
Gemcitabine Injection is a sterile solution in single - dose vials for intravenous use .
Each vial contains 200 mg , 1 g , or 2 g of gemcitabine equivalent to 227 . 7 mg , 1 . 139 g , or 2 . 277 g of gemcitabine HCl .
Each mL contains 38 mg of gemcitabine free base in Water for Injection , USP equivalent to 43 . 27 mg of gemcitabine HCl .
Hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Gemcitabine kills cells undergoing DNA synthesis and blocks the progression of cells through the G1 / S - phase boundary .
Gemcitabine is metabolized by nucleoside kinases to diphosphate ( dFdCDP ) and triphosphate ( dFdCTP ) nucleosides .
Gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase , an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA synthesis , resulting in reductions in deoxynucleotide concentrations , including dCTP .
Gemcitabine triphosphate competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA .
The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP by the action of the diphosphate enhances the incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA ( self - potentiation ) .
After the gemcitabine nucleotide is incorporated into DNA , only one additional nucleotide is added to the growing DNA strands which eventually results in the initiation of apoptotic cell death .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine were examined in 353 patients , with various solid tumors .
Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using data from patients treated for varying durations of therapy given weekly with periodic rest weeks and using both short infusions ( < 70 minutes ) and long infusions ( 70 to 285 minutes ) .
The total gemcitabine dose varied from 500 mg / m ² to 3600 mg / m ² .
Distribution The volume of distribution was increased with infusion length .
Volume of distribution of gemcitabine was 50 L / m ² following infusions lasting < 70 minutes .
For long infusions , the volume of distribution rose to 370 L / m ² .
Gemcitabine pharmacokinetics are linear and are described by a 2 - compartment model .
Population pharmacokinetic analyses of combined single and multiple dose studies showed that the volume of distribution of gemcitabine was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by duration of infusion and sex .
Gemcitabine plasma protein binding is negligible .
Elimination Metabolism The active metabolite , gemcitabine triphosphate , can be extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
The half - life of the terminal phase for gemcitabine triphosphate from mononuclear cells ranges from 1 . 7 to 19 . 4 hours .
Excretion Gemcitabine disposition was studied in 5 patients who received a single 1000 mg / m ² of radiolabeled drug as a 30 - minute infusion .
Within one ( 1 ) week , 92 % to 98 % of the dose was recovered , almost entirely in the urine .
Gemcitabine ( < 10 % ) and the inactive uracil metabolite , 2 ´ - deoxy - 2 ´ , 2 ´ - diﬂuorouridine ( dFdU ) , accounted for 99 % of the excreted dose .
The metabolite dFdU is also found in plasma .
Speciﬁc Populations Geriatric Patients Clearance of gemcitabine was affected by age .
The lower clearance in geriatric patients results in higher concentrations of gemcitabine for any given dose .
Differences in either clearance or volume of distribution based on patient characteristics or the duration of infusion result in changes in half - life and plasma concentrations .
Table 15 shows plasma clearance and half - life of gemcitabine following short infusions for typical patients by age and sex .
Gemcitabine half - life for short infusions ranged from 42 to 94 minutes , and for long infusions varied from 245 to 638 minutes , depending on age and sex , reﬂecting a greatly increased volume of distribution with longer infusions .
Male and Female Patients Females have lower clearance and longer half - lives than male patients as described in Table 15 .
Table 15 : Gemcitabine Clearance and Half - Life for the “ Typical ” Patient Age Clearance Men ( L / hr / m2 ) Clearance Women ( L / hr / m2 ) Half - Lifea Men ( min ) Half - Lifea Women ( min ) 29 92 . 2 69 . 4 42 49 45 75 . 7 57 48 57 65 55 . 1 41 . 5 61 73 79 40 . 7 30 . 7 79 94 a Half – life for Patients receiving < 70 minute infusion .
Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies have been conducted with gemcitabine in patients with decreased renal function .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies have been conducted with gemcitabine in patients with decreased hepatic function .
Drug Interaction Studies When gemcitabine ( 1250 mg / m ² on Days 1 and 8 ) and cisplatin ( 75 mg / m ² on Day 1 ) were administered in patients with NSCLC , the clearance of gemcitabine on Day 1 was 128 L / hr / m ² and on Day 8 was 107 L / hr / m ² .
Data from patients with NSCLC demonstrate that gemcitabine and carboplatin given in combination does not alter the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine or carboplatin compared to administration of either single agent , however , due to wide conﬁdence intervals and small sample size , interpatient variability may be observed .
Data from patients with metastatic breast cancer shows that gemcitabine has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics ( clearance and half - life ) of paclitaxel and paclitaxel has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of gemcitabine have not been conducted .
Gemcitabine was mutagenic in an in vitro mouse lymphoma ( L5178Y ) assay and was clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Gemcitabine intraperitoneal doses of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( about 1 / 700 the 1000 mg / m ² clinical dose based on BSA ) in male mice resulted in moderate to severe hypospermatogenesis , decreased fertility , and decreased implantations .
In female mice , fertility was not affected but maternal toxicities were observed at 1 . 5 mg / kg / day administered intravenously ( about 1 / 200 the 1000 mg / m ² clinical dose based on BSA ) and fetotoxicity or embryolethality was observed at 0 . 25 mg / kg / day administered intravenously ( about 1 / 1300 the 1000 mg / m ² clinical dose based on BSA ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Ovarian Cancer The efﬁcacy of gemcitabine was evaluated in a randomized trial ( Study 1 ) conducted in women with advanced ovarian cancer that had relapsed at least 6 months after ﬁrst - line platinum - based therapy .
Patients were randomized to receive either gemcitabine 1000 mg / m ² on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 - day cycle with carboplatin AUC 4 on Day 1 after gemcitabine administration ( n = 178 ) or carboplatin AUC 5 on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle ( n = 178 ) .
The major efﬁcacy outcome measure was progression - free survival ( PFS ) .
A total of 356 patients were enrolled .
Demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 16 .
Efﬁcacy results are presented in Table 17 and Figure 1 .
The addition of gemcitabine to carboplatin resulted in statistically signiﬁcant improvements in PFS and overall response rate .
Approximately 75 % of patients in each arm received additional chemotherapy for disease progression ; 13 of 120 patients in the carboplatin alone arm received gemcitabine for treatment of disease progression .
There was no signiﬁcant difference in overall survival between the treatment arms .

Figure 1 : Kaplan - Meier Curves for Progression _ Free Survival in Study 1 [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Breast Cancer The efﬁcacy of gemcitabine was evaluated in a multinational , randomized , open - label trial conducted in women receiving initial treatment for metastatic breast cancer and who have received prior adjuvant / neoadjuvant anthracycline chemotherapy unless clinically contraindicated .
Patients were randomized to receive gemcitabine 1250 mg / m ² on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 - day cycle with paclitaxel 175 mg / m ² administered on Day 1 before gemcitabine administration ( n = 267 ) or paclitaxel 175 mg / m ² on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle ( n = 262 ) .
The major efﬁcacy outcome measure was time to documented disease progression .
A total of 529 patients were enrolled .
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms ( Table 18 ) .
Efﬁcacy results are presented in Table 19 and Figure 2 .
The addition of gemcitabine to paclitaxel resulted in statistically signiﬁcant improvement in time to documented disease progression and overall response rate compared to paclitaxel alone .
There was no signiﬁcant difference in overall survival .

Figure 2 : Kaplan - Meier Curves for Time to Documented Disease Progression in Study 2 [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Non - Small Cell Lung Cancer The efﬁcacy of gemcitabine was evaluated in two randomized , multicenter trials .
Study 3 : 28 - Day Schedule A multinational , randomized trial ( Study 3 ) compared gemcitabine with cisplatin to cisplatin alone in the treatment of patients with inoperable Stage IIIA , IIIB , or IV NSCLC who had not received prior chemotherapy .
Patients were randomized to receive either gemcitabine 1000 mg / m ² on Days 1 , 8 , and 15 of each 28 - day cycle with cisplatin 100 mg / m ² on Day 1 after gemcitabine administration ( N = 260 ) or cisplatin 100 mg / m ² on Day 1 of each 28 - day cycle ( N = 262 ) .
The major efﬁcacy outcome measure was overall survival .
A total of 522 patients were enrolled .
Demographics and baseline characteristics ( Table 20 ) were similar between arms with the exception of histologic subtype of NSCLC , with 48 % of patients on the cisplatin arm and 37 % of patients on the gemcitabine with cisplatin arm having adenocarcinoma .
Efﬁcacy results are presented in Table 21 and Figure 3 .
Study 4 : 21 - Day Schedule A randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , multicenter trial ( Study 4 ) was conducted in patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC .
Patients were randomized to receive gemcitabine 1250 mg / m ² on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 - day cycle with cisplatin 100 mg / m ² on Day 1 after gemcitabine administration or etoposide 100 mg / m ² intravenously on Days 1 , 2 , and 3 with cisplatin 100 mg / m ² on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle .
The major efﬁcacy outcome measure was response rate .
A total of 135 patients were enrolled .
Demographics and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 20 .
Efﬁcacy results are presented in Table 21 .
There was no signiﬁcant difference in survival between the two treatment arms .
The median survival was 8 . 7 months for the gemcitabine with cisplatin arm versus 7 months for the etoposide with cisplatin arm .
Median time to disease progression for the gemcitabine with cisplatin arm was 5 months compared to 4 . 1 months on the etoposide with cisplatin arm ( Log rank p = 0 . 015 , two - sided ) .
The objective response rate for the gemcitabine with cisplatin arm was 33 % compared to 14 % on the etoposide with cisplatin arm ( Fisher ' s Exact p = 0 . 01 , two - sided ) .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 4 Pancreatic Cancer The efﬁcacy of gemcitabine was evaluated in two trials ( Studies 5 and 6 ) , a randomized , single - blind , two - arm , activecontrolled trial ( Study 5 ) conducted in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who had received no prior chemotherapy and in a single - arm , open - label , multicenter trial ( Study 6 ) conducted in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with ﬂuorouracil or a ﬂuorouracil - containing regimen .
In Study 5 , patients were randomized to receive either gemcitabine 1000 mg / m ² intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks followed by a one - week rest , then once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks every 28 - days in subsequent cycles ( n = 63 ) or ﬂuorouracil 600 mg / m ² intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly ( n = 63 ) .
In Study 6 , all patients received gemcitabine 1000 mg / m ² intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks followed by a one - week rest , then once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks every 28 - days in subsequent cycles .
The major efﬁcacy outcome measure in both trials was “ clinical beneﬁt response ” .
A patient was considered to have had a clinical beneﬁt response if either of the following occurred : • The patient achieved a ≥ 50 % reduction in pain intensity ( Memorial Pain Assessment Card ) or analgesic consumption , or a 20 - point or greater improvement in performance status ( Karnofsky Performance Status ) for a period of at least 4 consecutive weeks , without showing any sustained worsening in any of the other parameters .
Sustained worsening was deﬁned as 4 consecutive weeks with either any increase in pain intensity or analgesic consumption or a 20 - point decrease in performance status occurring during the ﬁrst 12 weeks of therapy .
OR • The patient was stable on all of the aforementioned parameters , and showed a marked , sustained weight gain ( ≥ 7 % increase maintained for ≥ 4 weeks ) not due to ﬂuid accumulation .
Study 5 enrolled 126 patients .
Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between the arms ( Table 22 ) .
The efﬁcacy results are shown in Table 23 and Figure 4 .
Patients treated with gemcitabine had statistically signiﬁcant increases in clinical beneﬁt response , survival , and time to disease progression compared to those randomized to receive ﬂuorouracil .
No conﬁrmed objective tumor responses were observed in either treatment arm .
