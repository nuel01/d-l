• Boxed Warning 9 / 2021 WARNING : ENDOMETRIAL CANCER , CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS , PROBABLE DEMENTIA and BREAST CANCER Estrogen - Alone Therapy Endometrial Cancer There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens .
Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia , which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
Perform adequate diagnostic measures , including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed , persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia The Women ’ s Health Initiative ( WHI ) estrogen - alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) in postmenopausal women ( 50 to 79 years of age ) during 7 . 1 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens ( CE ) [ 0 . 625 mg ] - alone , relative to placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The WHI Memory Study ( WHIMS ) estrogen - alone ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older during 5 . 2 years of treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone , relative to placebo .
It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
Do not use estrogen - alone therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 , 14 . 4 ) ] .
Only daily oral 0 . 625 mg CE was studied in the estrogen - alone substudy of the WHI .
Therefore , the relevance of the WHI findings regarding adverse cardiovascular events and dementia to lower CE doses , other routes of administration , or other estrogen - alone products is not known .
Without such data , it is not possible to definitively exclude these risks or determine the extent of these risks for other products .
Discuss with your patient the benefits and risks of estrogen - alone therapy , taking into account her individual risk profile .
Prescribe estrogens with or without progestogens at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman .
Estrogen Plus Progestin Therapy Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of DVT , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , stroke and myocardial infarction ( MI ) in postmenopausal women ( 50 to 79 years of age ) during 5 . 6 years of treatment with daily oral CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) [ 2 . 5 mg ] , relative to placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older during 4 years of treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) combined with MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) , relative to placebo .
It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
Do not use estrogen plus progestogen therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 , 14 . 4 ) ] .
Breast Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy also demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Only daily oral 0 . 625 mg CE and 2 . 5 mg MPA were studied in the estrogen plus progestin substudy of the WHI .
Therefore , the relevance of the WHI findings regarding adverse cardiovascular events , dementia and breast cancer to lower CE plus other MPA doses , other routes of administration , or other estrogen plus progestogen products is not known .
Without such data , it is not possible to definitively exclude these risks or determine the extent of these risks for other products .
Discuss with your patient the benefits and risks of estrogen plus progestogen therapy , taking into account her individual risk profile .
Prescribe estrogens with or without progestogens at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman .

1 . 3 Treatment of Hypoestrogenism due to Hypogonadism , Castration , or Primary Ovarian Failure [ Enter Generic Section here ] 1 . 4 Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Limitation of Use When prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis , first consider the use of non - estrogen medications .
Consider estrogen therapy only for women at significant risk of osteoporosis 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Generally , when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus , consider addition of a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer .
Generally , a woman without a uterus does not need to use a progestogen in addition to her estrogen therapy .
In some cases , however , hysterectomized women who have a history of endometriosis may need a progestogen [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 14 ) ] .
Use estrogen - alone , or in combination with a progestogen at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman .
Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary .
• • Start therapy with the Estradiol Transdermal System 0 . 025 mg per day applied to the skin once - weekly .
Dosage adjustment should be guided by the clinical response ( 2 . 1 ) • • Place the Estradiol Transdermal System on a clean , dry area of the lower abdomen ( below the umbilicus ) or upper quadrant of the buttock .

Increased risks of PE , DVT , stroke and MI are reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy .
Immediately discontinue estrogen with or without progestogen therapy if any of these occur or are suspected .
Manage appropriately any risk factors for arterial vascular disease ( for example , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , tobacco use , hypercholesterolemia , and obesity ) and / or venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) ( for example , personal history or family history of VTE , obesity , and systemic lupus erythematosus ) .
Stroke The WHI estrogen - alone substudy reported a statistically significant increased risk of stroke in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo ( 45 versus 33 strokes per 10 , 000 women - years , respectively ) .
The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Immediately discontinue estrogen - alone therapy if a stroke occurs or is suspected .
Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone versus those receiving placebo ( 18 versus 21 per 10 , 000 women - years ) . 1 The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically significant increased risk of stroke in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo ( 33 versus 25 strokes per 10 , 000 women years , respectively ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted . 1 Immediately discontinue estrogen plus progestogen therapy if a stroke occurs or is suspected .
Coronary Heart Disease The WHI estrogen - alone substudy reported no overall effect on coronary heart disease ( CHD ) events ( defined as nonfatal MI , silent MI , or CHD death ) in women receiving estrogen - alone compared to placebo2 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age , who were less than 10 years since menopause , suggest a reduction ( not statistically significant ) of CHD events in those women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone compared to placebo ( 8 versus 16 per 10 , 000 women - years ) . 1 The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk ( not statistically significant ) of CHD events in women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women receiving placebo ( 41 versus 34 per 10 , 000 women - years ) . 1 An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1 , and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease ( n = 2 , 763 ) , average 66 . 7 years of age , in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease ( Heart and Estrogen / Progestin Replacement Study ; HERS ) , treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit .
During an average follow - up of 4 . 1 years , treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD .
There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA - treated group than in the placebo group in year 1 , but not during the subsequent years .
Two thousand three hundred twenty - one ( 2 , 321 ) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS , HERS II .
Average follow - up in HERS II was an additional 2 . 7 years , for a total of 6 . 8 years overall .
Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS , HERS II , and overall .
Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy , the risk of VTE ( DVT and PE ) was increased for women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone compared to placebo ( 30 versus 22 per 10 , 000 women - years ) , although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance ( 23 versus 15 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years3 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Immediately discontinue estrogen - alone therapy if a VTE occurs or is suspected .
The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically significant 2 - fold greater rate of VTE in women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women receiving placebo ( 35 versus 17 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT ( 26 versus 13 per 10 , 000 women - years ) and PE ( 18 versus 8 per 10 , 000 women - years ) were also demonstrated .
The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted4 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Immediately discontinue estrogen plus progestogen therapy if a VTE occurs or is suspected .
If feasible , discontinue estrogens at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism , or during periods of prolonged immobilization .
5 . 2 Malignant Neoplasms Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus .
The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non - users and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose .
Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year .
The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use , with increased risks of 15 - to 24 - fold for 5 to 10 years or more , and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued .
Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen - alone or estrogen plus progestogen therapy is important .
Perform adequate diagnostic measures , including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated , to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding with unknown etiology .
There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose .
Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia , which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen - alone users .
In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years , daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [ relative risk ( RR ) 0 . 80 ] 5 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
After a mean follow - up of 5 . 6 years , the WHI substudy of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA compared to placebo .
In this substudy , prior use of estrogen - alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women .
The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 24 , and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10 , 000 women - years , for CE plus MPA compared with placebo .
Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy , the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 86 , and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo . 6 Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy , the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 09 , and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10 , 000 women - years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo .
In the same substudy , invasive breast cancers were larger , were more likely to be node positive , and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) group compared with the placebo group .
Metastatic disease was rare , with no apparent difference between the two groups .
Other prognostic factors , such as histologic subtype , grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups6 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Consistent with the WHI clinical trial , observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer with estrogen plus progestin therapy , and a smaller increase in the risk for breast cancer with estrogen - alone therapy , after several years of use .
The risk increased with duration of use and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment ( only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping ) .
Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater , and became apparent earlier , with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen - alone therapy .
These studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations , doses , or routes of administration .
The use of estrogen - alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation .
All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self - examinations .
In addition , mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age , risk factors , and prior mammogram results .
Ovarian Cancer The CE plus MPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years , the relative risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1 . 58 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 77 - 3 . 24 ) , but it was not statistically significant .
The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10 , 000 women - years . 7 A meta - analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer .
The primary analysis , using case - control comparisons , included 12 , 110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies .
The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1 . 41 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 . 32 to 1 . 50 ) ; there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure ( less than 5 years [ median of 3 years ] vs . greater than 5 years [ median of 10 years ] of use before the cancer diagnosis ) .
The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use ( discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis ) was 1 . 37 ( 95 % CI 1 . 27 to 1 . 48 ) , and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen - alone and estrogen plus progestin products .
The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer , however , is unknown .
5 . 3 Probable Dementia In the WHI Memory Study ( WHIMS ) estrogen - alone ancillary study , a population of 2 , 947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone or placebo .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 2 years , 28 women in the estrogen - alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia .
The relative risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 1 . 49 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 83 - 2 . 66 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years8 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study , a population of 4 , 532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) or placebo .
After an average follow - up of 4 years , 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia . The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2 . 05 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 21 - 3 . 48 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10 , 000 women - years8 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen - alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol , the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1 . 76 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 19 - 2 . 60 ) .
Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 4 Gallbladder Disease A 2 - to 4 - fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported .
5 . 5 Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases .
Discontinue estrogens , including the Estradiol Transdermal System if hypercalcemia occurs , and take appropriate measures to reduce the serum calcium level .
5 . 6 Visual Abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens .
Discontinue The Estradiol Transdermal System pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision , or a sudden onset of proptosis , diplopia , or migraine .
Permanently discontinue estrogens , including The Estradiol Transdermal System , if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions .
5 . 7 Addition of a Progestogen When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestogen for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration , or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen , have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone .
Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
There are , however , possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestogens with estrogens compared to estrogen - alone regimens .
These include an increased risk of breast cancer .
5 . 8 Elevated Blood Pressure In a small number of case reports , substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens .
In a large , randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trial , a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen .
5 . 9 Exacerbation of Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre - existing hypertriglyceridemia , estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis .
Discontinue the Estradiol Transdermal System if pancreatitis occurs .
5 . 10 Hepatic Impairment and / or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with hepatic impairment .
Exercise caution in any woman with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy .
In the case of recurrence of cholestatic jaundice , discontinue The Estradiol Transdermal System .
5 . 11 Exacerbation of Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid - binding globulin ( TBG ) levels .
Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone , thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range .
Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy .
Monitor thyroid function in these women during treatment with the Estradiol Transdermal System to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range .
5 . 12 Fluid Retention Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention .
Monitor any woman with a condition ( s ) that might predispose her to fluid retention , such as a cardiac or renal impairment .
Discontinue estrogen - alone therapy , including the Estradiol Transdermal System , with evidence of medically concerning fluid retention .
5 . 13 Hypocalcemia Estrogen - induced hypocalcemia may occur in women with hypoparathyroidism .
Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy , including the Estradiol Transdermal System , outweigh the risks in such women .
5 . 14 Exacerbation of Endometriosis A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post - hysterectomy with estrogen - alone therapy .
Consider the addition of progestogen therapy for women known to have residual endometriosis post - hysterectomy .
5 . 15 Hereditary Angioedema Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema .
Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy , including the Estradiol Transdermal System , outweigh the risks in such women .
5 . 16 Exacerbation of Other Conditions Estrogen therapy , including the Estradiol Transdermal System , may cause an exacerbation of asthma , diabetes mellitus , epilepsy , migraine , porphyria , systemic lupus erythematosus , and hepatic hemangiomas .
Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy outweigh the risks in such women .
5 . 17 Laboratory Tests Serum follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of postmenopausal women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy .
Laboratory parameters may be useful in guiding the Estradiol Transdermal System dosage for the treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism , castration and primary ovarian failure .
5 . 18 Drug - Laboratory Test Interactions Accelerated prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , and platelet aggregation time ; increased platelet count ; increased factors II , VII antigen , VIII antigen , VIII coagulant activity , IX , X , XII , VII - X complex , II - VII - X complex , and beta - thromboglobulin ; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III , decreased antithrombin III activity ; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity ; increased plasminogen antigen and activity .
• Increased TBG levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone , as measured by protein - bound iodine ( PBI ) , T4 levels ( by column or by radioimmunoassay ) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay .
T3 resin uptake is decreased , reflecting the elevated TBG .
Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered .
Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone .
• Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum , for example , corticosteroid binding globulin ( CBG ) , sex hormone - binding globulin ( SHBG ) , leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids , respectively .
Free hormone concentrations , such as testosterone and estradiol , may be decreased .
Other plasma proteins may be increased ( angiotensinogen / renin substrate , alpha - l - antitrypsin , ceruloplasmin ) .

The Estradiol Transdermal System 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data described below reflect pooled data from 5 clinical trials of the Estradiol Transdermal System .
A total of 614 women were exposed to the Estradiol Transdermal System for 3 months ( 193 women at 0 . 025 mg per day , 201 women at 0 . 05 mg per day , 194 women at 0 . 1 mg per day ) in randomized , double - blind trials of clinical efficacy versus placebo and versus active comparator .
All women were postmenopausal , had a serum estradiol level of less than 20 pg / mL , and a minimum of five moderate to severe hot flushes per week or a minimum of 15 hot flushes per week of any severity at baseline .
Included in this table are an additional 25 postmenopausal hysterectomized women exposed to the Estradiol Transdermal System 0 . 025 mg per day for 6 to 24 months ( N = 16 at 24 months ) in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study of the Estradiol Transdermal System for the prevention of osteoporosis .

The Estradiol Transdermal System 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of the Estradiol Transdermal System .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Genitourinary System Changes in bleeding pattern , pelvic pain Breast Breast cancer , breast pain , breast tenderness Cardiovascular Changes in blood pressure , palpitations , hot flashes Gastrointestinal Vomiting , abdominal pain , abdominal distension , nausea Skin Alopecia , hyperhidrosis , night sweats , urticaria , rash Eyes Visual disturbances , contact lens intolerance , Central Nervous System Depression , migraine , paresthesia , dizziness , anxiety , irritability , mood swings , nervousness , insomnia , headache Miscellaneous Fatigue , menopausal symptoms , weight increase , application site reaction , anaphylactic reactions 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) .
Therefore , inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism .
Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St . John ’ s wort ( hypericum perforatum ) preparations , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens , possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and / or changes in the uterine bleeding profile .
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin , clarithromycin , ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in adverse reactions .
• • • Inducers and / or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism and decrease or increase the estrogen plasma concentration .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary the Estradiol Transdermal System is not indicated for use in pregnancy .
There are no data with the use of the Estradiol Transdermal System in pregnant women ; however , epidemiologic studies and meta - analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or nongenital birth defects ( including cardiac anomalies and limb - reduction defects ) following exposure to combined hormonal contraceptives ( estrogens and progestins ) before conception or during early pregnancy .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation [ Click here to enter 8 . 2 Lactation ] Risk Summary Estrogens are present in human milk and can reduce milk production in breast - feeding women .
This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breast - feeding is well - established .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for the Estradiol Transdermal System and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the Estradiol Transdermal System or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use In general , the Estradiol Transdermal System is not indicated for use in pediatric patients .
Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population .
If estrogen is administered to patients whose bone growth is not complete , periodic monitoring of bone metabolism and effects on epiphyseal centers is recommended during estrogen administration .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing the Estradiol Transdermal System to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to the Estradiol Transdermal System .
The Women ’ s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy ( daily CE [ 0 . 625 mg ] - alone versus placebo ) , there was a higher relative risk of stroke in women greater than 65 years of age [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy ( daily CE [ 0 . 625 mg ] plus MPA [ 2 . 5 mg ] versus placebo ) , there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The Women ’ s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age , there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen - alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of estrogen may cause nausea , vomiting , breast tenderness , abdominal pain , drowsiness and fatigue , and withdrawal bleeding in women .
Treatment of overdose consists of discontinuation of the Estradiol Transdermal System therapy with institution of appropriate symptomatic care .
11 DESCRIPTION The Estradiol Transdermal System ( estradiol transdermal system ) , is designed to release estradiol continuously upon application to intact skin .
Six ( 6 . 5 , 9 . 375 , 12 . 5 , 15 , 18 . 75 and 25 cm2 ) systems are available to provide nominal in vivo delivery of 0 . 025 , 0 . 0375 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 06 , 0 . 075 or 0 . 1 mg respectively of estradiol per day .
The period of use is 7 days .
Each system has a contact surface area of either 6 . 5 , 9 . 375 , 12 . 5 , 15 , 18 . 75 or 25 cm2 , and contains 2 , 2 . 85 , 3 . 8 , 4 . 55 , 5 . 7 or 7 . 6 mg of estradiol USP respectively .
The composition of the systems per unit area is identical .
Estradiol USP is a white , crystalline powder , chemically described as estra - 1 , 3 , 5 ( 10 ) - triene - 3 , 17β - diol .
It has an empirical formula of C18 H24 O2 and molecular weight of 272 . 38 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The Estradiol Transdermal System transdermal system comprises three layers .
Proceeding from the visible surface toward the surface attached to the skin , these layers are : • 1 .
A translucent polyethylene film .
• 2 .
An acrylate adhesive matrix containing estradiol USP .
• 3 .
A protective liner of siliconized or fluoropolymer - coated polyester film is attached to the adhesive surface and must be removed before the system can be used .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] The active component of the transdermal system is estradiol .
The remaining components of the transdermal system ( acrylate copolymer adhesive , fatty acid esters , and polyethylene backing ) are pharmacologically inactive .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics .
Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions , estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites , estrone and estriol at the receptor level .
The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle , which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily , depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle .
After menopause , most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione , which is secreted by the adrenal cortex , to estrone in the peripheral tissues .
Thus , estrone and the sulfate conjugated form , estrone sulfate , are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women .
Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen - responsive tissues .
To date , two estrogen receptors have been identified .
These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue .
Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and FSH , through a negative feedback mechanism .
Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Generally , a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman ’ s therapeutic response to the Estradiol Transdermal System nor her risk for adverse outcomes .
Likewise , exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Transdermal administration of the Estradiol Transdermal System produces mean serum concentrations of estradiol comparable to those produced by premenopausal women in the early follicular phase of the ovulatory cycle .
The pharmacokinetics of estradiol following application of the Estradiol Transdermal System transdermal system were investigated in 197 healthy postmenopausal women in six studies .
In five of the studies , the Estradiol Transdermal System transdermal system was applied to the abdomen , and in a sixth study , application to the buttocks and abdomen were compared .
The Estradiol Transdermal System transdermal delivery system continuously releases estradiol which is transported across intact skin leading to sustained circulating levels of estradiol during a 7 - day treatment period .
The systemic availability of estradiol after transdermal administration is about 20 times higher than that after oral administration .
This difference is due to the absence of first pass metabolism when estradiol is given by the transdermal route .
In a bioavailability study , the Estradiol Transdermal System 6 . 5 cm2 was studied with the Estradiol Transdermal System 12 . 5 cm2 as reference .
The mean estradiol levels in serum from the two sizes are shown in Figure 1 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Dose proportionality was demonstrated for the Estradiol Transdermal System 6 . 5 cm2 as compared to the Estradiol Transdermal System 12 . 5 cm2 in a 2 - week crossover study with a 1 - week washout period between the two - transdermal systems in 24 postmenopausal women .
Dose proportionality was also demonstrated for the Estradiol Transdermal System ( 12 . 5 cm2 and 25 cm2 ) in a 1 - week study conducted in 54 postmenopausal women .
The mean steady state levels ( Cavg ) of the estradiol during the application of the Estradiol Transdermal System 25 cm2 and 12 . 5 cm2 on the abdomen were about 80 and 40 pg / mL , respectively .
In a 3 - week multiple application study in 24 postmenopausal women , the 25 cm2 Estradiol Transdermal System produced average peak estradiol concentrations ( Cmax ) of approximately 100 pg / mL .
Trough values at the end of each wear interval ( Cmin ) were approximately 35 pg / mL .
Nearly identical serum curves were seen each week , indicating little or no accumulation of estradiol in the body .
Serum estrone peak and trough levels were 60 and 40 pg / mL , respectively .
In a single dose , randomized , crossover study conducted to compare the effect of site of application , 38 postmenopausal women wore a single Estradiol Transdermal System 25 cm2 transdermal system for 1 week on the abdomen and buttocks .
The estradiol serum concentration profiles are shown in Figure 2 .
Values of Cmax and Cavg were , respectively , 25 percent and 17 percent higher with the buttock application than with the abdomen application .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Table 2 provides a summary of estradiol pharmacokinetic parameters determined during evaluation of the Estradiol Transdermal System transdermal system .
Table 2 : Pharmacokinetic Summary ( Mean Estradiol Values ) Estradiol Transdermal System Delivery Rate Surface Area ( cm2 ) Application Site No .

The relative standard deviation of each pharmacokinetic parameter after application to the buttock was lower than that after application to the abdomen ( for example , for Cmax 39 percent versus 62 percent , and for Cavg 35 percent versus 48 percent ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Distribution The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens .
Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs .
Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin .
Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens .
Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions .
These transformations take place mainly in the liver .
Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone , and both can be converted to estriol , which is a major urinary metabolite .
Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver , biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine , and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption .
In postmenopausal women , a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates , especially estrone sulfate , which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens .
Excretion Estradiol , estrone , and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates .
Adhesion An open - label study of adhesion potentials of placebo transdermal systems that correspond to the 6 . 5 cm2 and 12 . 5 cm2 sizes of the Estradiol Transdermal System was conducted in 112 healthy women of 45 to 75 years of age .
Each woman applied both transdermal systems weekly , on the upper outer abdomen , for 3 consecutive weeks .
It should be noted that lower abdomen and upper quadrant of the buttock are the approved sites of application for the Estradiol Transdermal System .
The adhesion assessment was done visually on Days 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 of each week of transdermal system wear .
A total of 1 , 654 adhesion observations were conducted for 333 transdermal systems of each size .
Of these observations , approximately 90 percent showed essentially no lift for both the 6 . 5 cm2 and 12 . 5 cm2 transdermal systems .
Of the total number of transdermal systems applied , approximately 5 percent showed complete detachment for each size .
Adhesion potentials of the 18 . 75 cm2 and 25 cm2 sizes of transdermal systems ( 0 . 075 mg per day and 0 . 1 mg per day ) have not been studied .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast , uterus , cervix , vagina , testis , and liver .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Effects on Vasomotor Symptoms in Postmenopausal Women A study of 214 women 25 to 74 years of age met the qualification criteria and were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups : 72 to the 0 . 05 mg estradiol patch , 70 to the 0 . 1 mg estradiol patch , and 72 to placebo .
Potential participants were postmenopausal women in good general health who experienced vasomotor symptoms .
Natural menopause patients had not menstruated for at least 12 months and surgical menopause patients had undergone bilateral oophorectomy at least 4 weeks before evaluation for study entry .
In order to enter the 11 - week treatment phase of the study , potential participants must have experienced a minimum of five moderate to severe hot flushes per week , or a minimum of 15 hot flushes of any severity per week , for 2 consecutive weeks .
Women wore the patches in a cyclical fashion ( three weeks on and one week off ) .
During treatment , all women used diaries to record the number and severity of hot flushes .
Women were monitored by clinic visits at the end of weeks 1 , 3 , 7 , and 11 and by telephone at the end of weeks 4 , 5 , 8 , and 9 .
Adequate data for the analysis of efficacy was available from 191 subjects .
The results are presented as the mean ± SD number of flushes in each of the 3 treatment weeks of each 4 - week cycle .
In the 0 . 05 mg estradiol group , the mean weekly hot flush rate across all treatment cycles decreased from 46 ± 6 . 5 at baseline to 20 ± 3 ( - 67 percent ) .
The 0 . 1 mg estradiol group had a decline in the mean weekly hot flush rate from 52 ± 4 . 4 at baseline to 16 ± 2 . 4 ( - 72 percent ) .
In the placebo group , the mean weekly hot flush rate declined from 53 ± 4 . 5 at baseline to 46 ± 6 . 5 ( - 18 . 1 percent ) .
Compared with placebo , the 0 . 05 mg and 0 . 1 mg estradiol groups showed a statistically significantly larger mean decrease in hot flushes across all treatment cycles ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
When the response to treatment was analyzed for each of the three cycles of therapy , similar statistically significant differences were observed between both estradiol treatment groups and the placebo group during all treatment cycles .
In a double - blind , placebo - controlled , randomized study of 187 women receiving estradiol 0 . 025 mg per day or placebo continuously for up to three 28 - day cycles , the estradiol 0 . 025 mg per day dosage was shown to be statistically better than placebo at weeks 4 and 12 for relief of both the frequency and severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms .

14 . 2 Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Postmenopausal Women A two - year clinical trial enrolled a total of 175 healthy , hysterectomized , postmenopausal , non - osteoporotic ( that is , lumbar spine bone mineral density > 0 . 9 gm / cm2 ) women at 10 study centers in the United States .
A total of 129 participating women were allocated to receive active treatment with 4 different doses of estradiol patches ( 6 . 5 , 12 . 5 , 15 , 25 cm2 ) and 46 participating women were allocated to receive placebo patches .
Seventy - seven percent of the randomized women ( 100 on active drug and 34 on placebo ) contributed data to the analysis of percent change of anterior - posterior ( A - P ) spine BMD , the primary efficacy variable ( see Figure 3 ) .
A statistically significant overall treatment effect at each timepoint was noted , implying bone preservation for all active treatment groups at all timepoints , as opposed to bone loss for placebo at all timepoints .
Figure 3 : Mean Percent Change from Baseline in Lumbar Spine ( A - P View ) Bone Mineral Density By Treatment and Time Last Observation Carried Forward [ MULTIMEDIA ] Percent change in BMD of the total hip ( see Figure 4 ) was also statistically significantly different from placebo for all active treatment groups .
This figure is based on 74 percent of the randomized women ( 95 on active drug and 34 on placebo ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Women ' s Health Initiative Studies The WHI enrolled approximately 27 , 000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone or in combination with MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases .
The primary endpoint was the incidence of CHD ( defined as nonfatal MI , silent MI and CHD death ) , with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome .
A " global index " included the earliest occurrence of CHD , invasive breast cancer , stroke , PE , endometrial cancer ( only in the CE plus MPA substudy ) , colorectal cancer , hip fracture , or death due to other causes .
These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE - alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms .
WHI Estrogen - Alone Substudy The WHI estrogen - alone substudy was stopped early because an increased risk of stroke was observed , and it was deemed that no further information would be obtained regarding the risk and benefits of estrogen - alone in predetermined primary endpoints .
Results of the estrogen - alone substudy , which included 10 , 739 women ( average 63 years of age , range 50 to 79 : 75 . 3 percent White , 15 . 1 percent Black , 6 . 1 percent Hispanic , 3 . 6 percent Other ) after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years , are presented in Table 4 .

[ 7 ] A subset of the events was combined in a " global index " , defined as the earliest occurrence of CHD events , invasive breast cancer , stroke , pulmonary embolism , endometrial cancer , colorectal cancer , hip fracture , or death due to other causes .
For those outcomes included in the WHI " global index " that reached statistical significance , the absolute excess risks per 10 , 000 women - years in the group treated with CE - alone was 12 more strokes , while the absolute risk reduction per 10 , 000 women - years was 7 fewer hip fractures . 9 The absolute excess risk of events included in the " global index " was a non - significant 5 events per 10 , 000 women - years .
There was no difference between the groups in terms of all - cause mortality .
No overall difference for primary CHD events ( nonfatal MI , silent MI and CHD death ) and invasive breast cancer incidence in women receiving CE - alone compared with placebo was reported in final centrally adjudicated results from the estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years .
See Table 4 .
Centrally adjudicated results for stroke events from the estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years , reported no significant difference in the distribution of stroke subtype and severity , including fatal strokes , in women receiving estrogen - alone compared to placebo .
Estrogen - alone increased the risk of ischemic stroke , and this excess risk was present in all subgroups of women examined . 10 See Table 4 .
Timing of initiation of estrogen - alone therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk - benefit profile .
The WHI estrogen - alone substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a non - significant trend toward reduced risk for CHD [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 0 . 63 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 36 - 1 . 09 ) ] and overall mortality [ HR 0 . 71 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 46 - 1 . 11 ) ] .
WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early .
According to the predefined stopping rule , after an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years of treatment , the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the " global index " .
The absolute excess risk of events included in the “ global index ” was 19 per 10 , 000 women - years .
For those outcomes included in the WHI “ global index ” that reached statistical significance after 5 . 6 years of follow - up , the absolute excess risks per 10 , 000 women - years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events , 8 more strokes , 10 more PEs , and 8 more invasive breast cancers , while the absolute risk reduction per 10 , 000 women - years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures .
Results of the CE plus MPA substudy , which included 16 , 608 women ( average 63 years of age , range 50 to 79 ; 83 . 9 percent White , 6 . 5 percent Black , 5 . 4 percent Hispanic , 3 . 9 percent Other ) , are presented in Table 5 .
These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years .

Timing of initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile .
The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a non - significant trend toward reduced risk for overall mortality [ HR 0 . 69 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 44 - 1 . 07 ) ] .
14 . 4 Women ' s Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen - alone ancillary study of WHI enrolled 2 , 947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age and older ( 45 percent were 65 to 69 years of age ; 36 percent were 70 to 74 years of age ; 19 percent were 75 years of age and older ) to evaluate the effects of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone on the incidence of probable dementia ( primary outcome ) compared to placebo .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 2 years , the relative risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 1 . 49 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 83 - 2 . 66 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years .
Probable dementia as defined in the study included Alzheimer ’ s disease ( AD ) , vascular dementia ( VaD ) and mixed types ( having features of both AD and VaD ) .
The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD .
Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study enrolled 4 , 532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older ( 47 percent were 65 to 69 years of age ; 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age ; and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older ) to evaluate the effects of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) on the incidence of probable dementia ( primary outcome ) compared to placebo .
After an average follow - up of 4 years , the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2 . 05 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 21 - 3 . 48 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10 , 000 women - years .
Probable dementia as defined in the study included AD , VaD and mixed types ( having features of both AD and VaD ) .
The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD .
Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol , the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1 . 76 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 19 - 2 . 60 ) .
Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment .
It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] 15 REFERENCES • 1 .

What is the Estradiol Transdermal System ?
the Estradiol Transdermal System is a prescription medicine patch ( transdermal system ) that contains estradiol ( an estrogen hormone ) .
What is the Estradiol Transdermal System used for ?
The Estradiol Transdermal System is used after menopause to : • • Reduce moderate to severe hot flashes • Estrogens are hormones made by a woman ’ s ovaries .
The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 and 55 years old .
This drop in body estrogen levels causes the " change of life " or menopause ( the end of monthly menstrual periods ) .
Sometimes , both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place .
The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes " surgical menopause . "
• When estrogen levels begin dropping , some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms , such as feelings of warmth in the face , neck , and chest , or sudden intense feelings of heat and sweating ( " hot flashes " or " hot flushes " ) .
In some women , the symptoms are mild , and they will not need to use estrogens .
In other women , symptoms can be more severe .
• • Treat moderate to severe menopausal changes in and around the vagina • You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with the Estradiol Transdermal System to control these problems .
If you use the Estradiol Transdermal System only to treat your menopausal changes in and around your vagina , talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you .
• • Treat certain conditions in women before menopause if their ovaries do not produce enough estrogens naturally • • Help reduce your chances of getting osteoporosis ( thin weak bones ) • Osteoporosis from menopause is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and easier to break .
If you use the Estradiol Transdermal System only to prevent osteoporosis due to menopause , talk with your healthcare provider about whether a different treatment or medicine without estrogens might be better for you .
You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with the Estradiol Transdermal System .
