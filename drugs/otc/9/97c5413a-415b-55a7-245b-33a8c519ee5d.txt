( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Paroxetine HCL CR is contraindicated in patients : • Taking , or within 14 days of stopping , MAOIs ( including the MAOIs linezolid and intravenous methylene blue ) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
• Taking thioridazine because of risk of QT prolongation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
• Taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
• With known hypersensitivity ( e . g . , anaphylaxis , angioedema , Stevens - Johnson syndrome ) to paroxetine or to any of the inactive ingredients in Paroxetine HCL CR [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 ) ] .
• Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) or use within 14 days of discontinuing a MAOIs .
( 4 , 5 . 2 , 7 ) • Concomitant use of pimozide or thioridazine .
( 4 , 5 . 3 , 7 ) • Known hypersensitivity to paroxetine or to any of the inactive ingredients in Paroxetine HCL CR .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Serotonin Syndrome : Increased risk when co - administered with other serotonergic agents ( e . g . , SSRI , SNRI , triptans ) , but also when taken alone .
If occurs , discontinue Paroxetine HCL CR and initiate supportive measures .
( 5 . 2 ) • Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity : Can cause fetal and neonatal harm .
Increased risk of cardiovascular malformations for exposure during the first trimester .
Exposure in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension ( PPNH ) of the newborn .
( 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 ) • Increased Risk of Bleeding : Concomitant use of aspirin , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , other antiplatelet drugs , warfarin , and other anticoagulant drugs may increase risk .
( 5 . 5 ) • Activation of Mania / Hypomania : Screen patients for bipolar disorder .
( 5 . 6 ) • Seizures : Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders .
( 5 . 8 ) • Angle - Closure Glaucoma : Angle - closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles , treated with antidepressants .
( 5 . 9 ) • Sexual Dysfunction : Paroxetine HCL CR may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction .
( 5 . 13 ) 5 . 1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo - controlled trials of antidepressant drugs ( SSRIs and other antidepressant classes ) that included approximately 77 , 000 adult patients and 4 , 500 pediatric patients , the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant - treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo - treated patients .
There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs , but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied .
There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications , with the highest incidence in patients with MDD .
The drug - placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 2 .
Table 2 : Risk Differences of the Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo - Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult PatientsAge Range Drug - Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors per 1 , 000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo < 18 years old 14 additional patients 18 - 24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 - 64 years old 1 fewer patients ≥ 65 years old 6 fewer patients It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children , adolescents , and young adults extends to longer - term use , i . e . , beyond four months .
However , there is substantial evidence from placebo - controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors .
Monitor all antidepressant - treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors , especially during the initial few months of drug therapy , and at times of dosage changes .
Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider .
Consider changing the therapeutic regimen , including possibly discontinuing Paroxetine HCL CR , in patients whose depression is persistently worse , or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors .
5 . 2 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin - norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) and SSRIs , including Paroxetine HCL CR , can precipitate serotonin syndrome , a potentially life - threatening condition .
The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs ( including triptans , tricyclic antidepressants , fentanyl , lithium , tramadol , tryptophan , buspirone , amphetamines , and St . John ' s Wort ) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin , i . e . , MAOIs [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone .
Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes ( e . g . , agitation , hallucinations , delirium , and coma ) , autonomic instability ( e . g . , tachycardia , labile blood pressure , dizziness , diaphoresis , flushing , hyperthermia ) , neuromuscular symptoms ( e . g . , tremor , rigidity , myoclonus , hyperreflexia , incoordination ) , seizures , and gastrointestinal symptoms ( e . g . , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ) .
The concomitant use of Paroxetine HCL CR with MAOIs is contraindicated .
In addition , do not initiate Paroxetine HCL CR in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue .
No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes ( such as oral tablets or local tissue injection ) .
If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Paroxetine HCL CR , discontinue Paroxetine HCL CR before initiating treatment with the MAOI [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor all patients taking Paroxetine HCL CR for the emergence of serotonin syndrome .
Discontinue treatment with Paroxetine HCL CR and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur , and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment .
If concomitant use of Paroxetine HCL CR with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted , inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms .
5 . 3 Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation The CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine can elevate plasma levels of thioridazine and pimozide .
Since thioridazine and pimozide given alone produce prolongation of the QTc interval and increase the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias , the use of Paroxetine HCL CR is contraindicated in combination with thioridazine and pimozide [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 4 Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity Paroxetine HCL CR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations .
Exposure to paroxetine in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn ( PPNH ) and / or neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization , respiratory support , and tube feeding .
If Paroxetine HCL CR is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Paroxetine HCL CR , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 5 Increased Risk of Bleeding Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition , including Paroxetine HCL CR , increase the risk of bleeding events .
Concomitant use of aspirin , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS ) , other antiplatelet drugs , warfarin , and other anticoagulants may add to this risk .
Case reports and epidemiological studies ( case ‑ control and cohort design ) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding .
Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses , hematomas , epistaxis , and petechiae to life - threatening hemorrhages .
Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Paroxetine HCL CR and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants .
For patients taking warfarin , carefully monitor the international normalized ratio .
5 . 6 Activation of Mania or Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder , treating a depressive episode with Paroxetine HCL CR or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed / manic episode .
During controlled clinical trials of immediate ‑ release paroxetine hydrochloride , hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1 % of paroxetine ‑ treated unipolar patients compared to 1 . 1 % of active ‑ control and 0 . 3 % of placebo ‑ treated unipolar patients .
Prior to initiating treatment with Paroxetine HCL CR , screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder , mania , or hypomania .
5 . 7 Discontinuation Syndrome Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants , particularly after abrupt discontinuation , include : nausea , sweating , dysphoric mood , irritability , agitation , dizziness , sensory disturbances ( e . g . , paresthesia , such as electric shock sensations ) , tremor , anxiety , confusion , headache , lethargy , emotional lability , insomnia , hypomania , tinnitus , and seizures .
A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] .
Adverse reactions have been reported upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in pediatric patients .
The safety and effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR in pediatric patients have not been established [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 8 Seizures Paroxetine HCL CR has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders .
Patients with history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies .
Paroxetine HCL CR should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder and should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures .
5 . 9 Angle - Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including Paroxetine HCL CR may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy .
Cases of angle - closure glaucoma associated with use of paroxetine hydrochloride tablets have been reported .
Avoid use of antidepressants , including Paroxetine HCL CR , in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles .
5 . 10 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs , including Paroxetine HCL CR .
Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol / L have been reported .
Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache , difficulty concentrating , memory impairment , confusion , weakness , and unsteadiness , which may lead to falls .
Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and / or acute cases have included hallucination , syncope , seizure , coma , respiratory arrest , and death .
In many cases , this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( SIADH ) .
In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia , discontinue Paroxetine HCL CR and institute appropriate medical intervention .
Elderly patients , patients taking diuretics , and those who are volume - depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs and SSRIs .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
5 . 11 Reduction of Efficacy of Tamoxifen Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen , as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse / mortality , may be reduced with concomitant use of paroxetine as a result of paroxetine ’ s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 and lower blood levels of tamoxifen [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
One study suggests that the risk may increase with longer duration of coadministration .
However , other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk .
When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer , prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition .
5 . 12 Bone Fracture Epidemiological studies on bone fracture risk during exposure to some antidepressants , including SSRIs , have reported an association between antidepressant treatment and fractures .
There are multiple possible causes for this observation , and it is unknown to what extent fracture risk is directly attributable to SSRI treatment .
5 . 13 Sexual Dysfunction Use of SSRIs , including Paroxetine HCL CR , may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In male patients , SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure , decreased libido , and erectile dysfunction .
In female patients , SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm .
It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of Paroxetine HCL CR and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment , because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported .
When evaluating changes in sexual function , obtaining a detailed history ( including timing of symptom onset ) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes , including the underlying psychiatric disorder .
Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Safety data for Paroxetine HCL CR is from 11 short - term , placebo ‑ controlled clinical trials including 3 studies in patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) ( Studies 1 , 2 , and 3 ) , 3 studies in patients with panic disorder ( PD ) ( Studies 4 , 5 , and 6 ) , 1 study in patients with social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) ( Study 7 ) , and 4 studies in female patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder ( PMDD ) ( Studies 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
These 11 trials included 1627 patients treated with Paroxetine HCL CR .
• Studies 1 and 2 were 12 - week studies that enrolled patients 18 to 65 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR at doses ranging from 25 mg to 62 . 5 mg once daily .

a < 1 % means greater than zero and less than 1 % .
b The luteal phase and continuous dosing PMDD trials were not designed for making direct comparisons between the 2 dosing regimens .
c Mostly anorgasmia or difficulty achieving orgasm .
Dose Dependent Adverse Reactions Comparison of the incidence of adverse reactions ( placebo vs . 12 . 5 mg Paroxetine HCL CR vs . 25 mg Paroxetine HCL CR ) from studies 8 , 9 , 10 showed the following adverse reactions to be dose - related : Nausea , somnolence , sweating , dry mouth , dizziness , decreased appetite , tremor , impaired concentration , yawn , paresthesia , hyperkinesia , and vaginitis .
Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction Although changes in sexual desire , sexual performance , and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder , they may also be a consequence of SSRI treatment .
However , reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire , performance , and satisfaction are difficult to obtain , in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them .
Accordingly , estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence .
The percentage of patients reporting symptoms of sexual dysfunction in the Studies 1 and 2 ( nonelderly patients with MDD ) , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 are presented in Table 5 : Table 5 .

Paroxetine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism .
In those cases with a known outcome , patients recovered without sequelae .
Less Common Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions occurred during the clinical studies of Paroxetine HCL CR and are not included elsewhere in the labeling .
Reactions are categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions : Frequent adverse reactions are those occurring on 1 or more occasions in at least 1 / 100 patients ; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1 / 100 to 1 / 1 , 000 patients ; rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1 / 1 , 000 patients .
Cardiovascular System : Infrequent was postural hypotension .
Hemic and Lymphatic System : Rare was thrombocytopenia .
Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders : Infrequent were generalized edema and hypercholesteremia .
Nervous System : Infrequent were convulsion , akathisia , and manic reaction .
Psychiatric : Infrequent were hallucinations .
Skin and Appendages : Frequent was rash ; infrequent was urticaria ; rare was angioedema and erythema multiforme .
Urogenital System : Infrequent was urinary retention ; rare was urinary incontinence .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during post approval use of paroxetine .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Acute pancreatitis , elevated liver function tests ( the most severe cases were deaths due to liver necrosis , and grossly elevated transaminases associated with severe liver dysfunction ) , Guillain ‑ Barré syndrome , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis , priapism , syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion ( SIADH ) , prolactinemia and galactorrhea ; extrapyramidal symptoms which have included akathisia , bradykinesia , cogwheel rigidity , dystonia , hypertonia , trismus ; status epilepticus , acute renal failure , pulmonary hypertension , allergic alveolitis , anaphylaxis , eclampsia , laryngismus , optic neuritis , porphyria , restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) , ventricular fibrillation , ventricular tachycardia ( including torsade de pointes ) , hemolytic anemia , events related to impaired hematopoiesis ( including aplastic anemia , pancytopenia , bone marrow aplasia , and agranulocytosis ) , and vasculitic syndromes ( such as Henoch ‑ Schönlein purpura ) .

( 7 ) • Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 : Reduce dosage of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 as warranted .
( 7 ) • Concomitant use with Tamoxifen : Consider use of an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition .
( 5 . 11 , 7 ) 7 . 1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paroxetine HCL CR Table 6 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Paroxetine HCL CR .
Table 6 : Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paroxetine HCL CR Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ( MAOIs ) Clinical Impact The concomitant use of SSRIs , including Paroxetine HCL CR , and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome .
Intervention Paroxetine HCL CR is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs , including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Examples selegiline , tranylcypromine , isocarboxazid , phenelzine , linezolid , methylene blue Pimozide and Thioridazine Clinical Impact Increased plasma concentrations of pimozide and thioridazine , drugs with a narrow therapeutic index , may increase the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias .
Intervention Paroxetine HCL CR is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide or thioridazine [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Other Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Paroxetine HCL CR increases the risk of serotonin syndrome .
Intervention Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome , particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases .
If serotonin syndrome occurs , consider discontinuation of Paroxetine HCL CR and / or concomitant serotonergic drugs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Examples other SSRIs , SNRIs , triptans , tricyclic antidepressants , fentanyl , lithium , tramadol , tryptophan , buspirone , St . John ’ s Wort Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis ( antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants ) Clinical Impact The concurrent use of an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant with Paroxetine HCL CR may potentiate the risk of bleeding .
Intervention Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Paroxetine HCL CR and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants .
For patients taking warfarin , carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Examples aspirin , clopidogrel , heparin , warfarin Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein Clinical Impact Paroxetine HCL CR is highly bound to plasma protein .
The concomitant use of Paroxetine HCL CR with another drug that is highly bound to plasma protein may increase free concentrations of Paroxetine HCL CR or other tightly - bound drugs in plasma .
Intervention Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of Paroxetine HCL CR or other protein - bound drugs as warranted .
Examples warfarin Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 Clinical Impact Paroxetine HCL CR is a CYP2D6 inhibitor [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The concomitant use of Paroxetine HCL CR with a CYP2D6 substrate may increase the exposure of the CYP2D6 substrate Intervention Decrease the dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate if needed with concomitant Paroxetine HCL CR use .
Conversely , an increase in dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate may be needed if Paroxetine HCL CR is discontinued .
Examples propafenone , flecainide , atomoxetine , desipramine , dextromethorphan , metoprolol , nebivolol , perphenazine , tolterodine , venlafaxine , risperidone .
Tamoxifen Clinical Impact Concomitant use of tamoxifen with Paroxetine HCL CR may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite ( endoxifen ) and reduced efficacy of tamoxifen Intervention Consider use of an alternative antidepressant little or no CYP2D6 inhibition [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] .
Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir Clinical Impact Co - administration of fosamprenavir / ritonavir with paroxetine significantly decreased plasma levels of paroxetine .
Intervention Any dose adjustment should be guided by clinical effect ( tolerability and efficacy ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Can cause fetal and neonatal harm .
Advise women of potential risk to the fetus .
( 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 ) • Nursing Mothers : Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 14 ) . ]
Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of congenital malformations , particularly cardiovascular malformations .
If paroxetine is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine , advise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus .
• A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy ( n = 815 ) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations ( 2 % risk in paroxetine - exposed infants ) compared to the entire registry population ( 1 % risk ) , for an odds ratio ( OR ) of 1 . 8 ( 95 % confidence interval 1 . 1 to 2 . 8 ) .
No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine - exposed infants .
The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine - exposed infants were primarily ventricular septal defects ( VSDs ) and atrial septal defects ( ASDs ) .
Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery .
• A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States ( United Healthcare data ) evaluated 5 , 956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester ( n = 815 for paroxetine ) .
This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine ( risk of 1 . 5 % ) compared to other antidepressants ( risk of 1 % ) , for an OR of 1 . 5 ( 95 % confidence interval 0 . 8 to 2 . 9 ) .
Of the 12 paroxetine - exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations , 9 had VSDs .
This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine ( 4 % risk ) compared to other ( 2 % risk ) antidepressants ( OR 1 . 8 ; 95 % confidence interval 1 . 2 to 2 . 8 ) .
• Two large case - control studies using separate databases , each with > 9 , 000 birth defect cases and > 4 , 000 controls , found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2 - to 3 - fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions .
In one study the OR was 2 . 5 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1 to 6 , 7 exposed infants ) and in the other study the OR was 3 . 3 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 3 to 8 . 8 , 6 exposed infants ) .
Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall , cardiovascular , or specific congenital malformations .
A meta - analysis of epidemiological data over a 16 - year period ( 1992 to 2008 ) on first trimester paroxetine use in pregnancy and congenital malformations included the above - noted studies in addition to others ( n = 17 studies that included overall malformations and n = 14 studies that included cardiovascular malformations ; n = 20 distinct studies ) .
While subject to limitations , this meta - analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations ( prevalence odds ratio [ POR ] 1 . 5 ; 95 % confidence interval 1 . 2 to 1 . 9 ) and overall malformations ( POR 1 . 2 ; 95 % confidence interval 1 . 1 to 1 . 4 ) with paroxetine use during the first trimester .
It was not possible in this meta - analysis to determine the extent to which the observed prevalence of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to that of overall malformations , nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to the observed prevalence of all cardiovascular malformations .
Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment , consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy , paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Treatment of Pregnant Women During Their Third Trimester : Neonates exposed to SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) , including Paroxetine HCL CR , late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization , respiratory support , and tube feeding .
Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery .
Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress , cyanosis , apnea , seizures , temperature instability , feeding difficulty , vomiting , hypoglycemia , hypotonia , hypertonia , hyperreflexia , tremor , jitteriness , irritability , and constant crying .
These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or , possibly , a drug discontinuation syndrome .
It should be noted that , in some cases , the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn ( PPHN ) .
PPHN occurs in 1 – 2 per 1 , 000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality .
In a retrospective case - control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy , the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six - fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20 th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy .
There have also been postmarketing reports of premature births in pregnant women exposed to paroxetine or other SSRIs .
When treating a pregnant woman with paroxetine during the third trimester , the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
A prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy .
The women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication .
Animal Findings : Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg / kg / day in rats and 6 mg / kg / day in rabbits administered during organogenesis .
These doses are approximately 6 ( rat ) and less than 2 ( rabbit ) times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD – 75 mg ) on an mg / m2 basis .
These studies have revealed no evidence of malformations .
However , in rats , there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation .
This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg / kg / day or approximately one ‑ thirteens of the MRHD on an mg / m2 basis .
The no ‑ effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined .
The cause of these deaths is not known .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Like many other drugs , paroxetine is secreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Paroxetine HCL CR , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR in pediatric patients have not been established [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Three placebo - controlled trials in 752 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with immediate - release paroxetine , and effectiveness was not established in pediatric patients .
Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs .
In placebo - controlled clinical trials conducted with pediatric patients , the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 2 % of pediatric patients treated with immediate - release paroxetine hydrochloride and at a rate at least twice that for pediatric patients receiving placebo : emotional lability ( including self - harm , suicidal thoughts , attempted suicide , crying , and mood fluctuations ) , hostility , decreased appetite , tremor , sweating , hyperkinesia , and agitation .
Adverse reactions upon discontinuation of treatment with immediate - release paroxetine hydrochloride in the pediatric clinical trials that included a taper phase regimen , which occurred in at least 2 % of patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo , were : emotional lability ( including suicidal ideation , suicide attempt , mood changes , and tearfulness ) , nervousness , dizziness , nausea , and abdominal pain .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use SSRIs and SNRIs , including Paroxetine HCL CR , have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients , who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
In premarketing clinical trials with immediate ‑ release paroxetine hydrochloride , 17 % of paroxetine treated patients ( approximately 700 ) were 65 years or older .
Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a decreased clearance in the elderly , and a lower starting dose is recommended ; however , no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal and / or Hepatic Impairment Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with renal and hepatic impairment .
The initial dosage should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment and patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE The following have been reported with paroxetine tablet overdosage : • Seizures , which may be delayed , and altered mental status including coma .
• Cardiovascular toxicity , which may be delayed , including QRS and QTc interval prolongation .
Hypertension most commonly seen , but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co - ingestants including alcohol .
• Serotonin syndrome ( patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk ) .
Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a paroxetine overdose .
Consider contacting a Poison Center ( 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 ) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations .
11 DESCRIPTION Paroxetine HCL CR , contains paroxetine hydrochloride , an SSRI .
It is the hydrochloride salt of a phenylpiperidine compound identified chemically as ( - ) - trans - 4 R - ( 4 ' - fluorophenyl ) - 3 S - [ ( 3 ' , 4 ' - methylenedioxyphenoxy ) methyl ] piperidine hydrochloride hemihydrate and has the empirical formula of C19H20FNO3 · HCl · 1 / 2H2O .
The molecular weight is 374 . 8 g / mol ( 329 . 4 g / mol as free base ) .
The structural formula of paroxetine hydrochloride is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Paroxetine hydrochloride is an odorless , off ‑ white powder , having a melting point range of 120 ° C to 138 ° C and a solubility of 5 . 4 mg / mL in water .
Paroxetine HCL CR tablets are intended for oral administration .
Each extended ‑ release tablet contains 12 . 5 mg , 25 mg , or 37 . 5 mg paroxetine equivalent to 14 . 25 mg , 28 . 51 mg , or 42 . 76 mg of paroxetine hydrochloride , respectively .
One layer of the tablet consists of a degradable barrier layer and the other contains the active material in a hydrophilic matrix .
Inactive ingredients consist of glyceryl behenate , hypromellose , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate , methacrylic acid copolymer type C , polyethylene glycols , polysorbate 80 , polyvinylpyrrolidone , silicon dioxide , sodium lauryl sulfate , talc , titanium dioxide , triethyl citrate and the following colorants : D & C Red No . 30 aluminum lake ( 25 mg ) , D & C Yellow No . 10 aluminum lake ( 12 . 5 mg ) , FD & C Blue No . 2 aluminum lake ( 37 . 5 mg ) , FD & C Yellow No . 6 aluminum lake ( 12 . 5 mg ) , red ferric oxide ( 25 mg ) and Yellow ferric oxide ( 12 . 5 mg and 37 . 5 mg ) .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , panic disorder ( PD ) , social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) , and premenstrual dysphoric disorder ( PMDD ) is unknown , but is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin ( 5 - HT ) .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets .
In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake ( SSRI ) and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tablets of Paroxetine HCL CR contain a degradable polymeric matrix designed to control the dissolution rate of paroxetine over a period of approximately 4 to 5 hours .
In addition to controlling the rate of drug release in vivo , an enteric coat delays the start of drug release until tablets of Paroxetine HCL CR have left the stomach .
Paroxetine extended - release tablets are completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt .
In a study in which normal male and female subjects ( n = 23 ) received single oral doses of Paroxetine HCL CR at 4 dosage strengths ( 12 . 5 mg , 25 mg , 37 . 5 mg , and 50 mg ) , paroxetine Cmax and AUC0 - inf increased disproportionately with dose ( as seen also with immediate ‑ release formulations ) .
Mean Cmax and AUC0 - inf values at these doses were 2 , 5 . 5 , 9 , and 12 . 5 ng / mL , and 121 , 261 , 338 , and 540 ng · hr .
/ mL , respectively .
Tmax was observed typically between 6 and 10 hours post ‑ dose , reflecting a reduction in absorption rate compared with immediate ‑ release formulations .
The bioavailability of 25 mg Paroxetine HCL CR is not affected by food .
Distribution Paroxetine distributes throughout the body , including the CNS , with only 1 % remaining in the plasma .
Approximately 95 % and 93 % of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng / mL and 400 ng / mL , respectively .
Under clinical conditions , paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng / mL .
Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin .
Elimination Metabolism The mean elimination half - life of paroxetine was 15 to 20 hours throughout a range of single doses of Paroxetine HCL CR ( 12 . 5 mg , 25 mg , 37 . 5 mg , and 50 mg ) .
During repeated administration of Paroxetine HCL CR ( 25 mg once daily ) , steady state was reached within 2 weeks ( i . e . , comparable to immediate ‑ release formulations ) .
In a repeat ‑ dose study in which normal male and female subjects ( n = 23 ) received Paroxetine HCL CR ( 25 mg daily ) , mean steady state Cmax , Cmin , and AUC0 - 24 values were 30 ng / mL , 20 ng / mL , and 550 ng · hr .
/ mL , respectively .
Based on studies using immediate ‑ release formulations , steady ‑ state drug exposure based on AUC0 - 24 was several ‑ fold greater than would have been predicted from single ‑ dose data .
The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable .
In steady ‑ state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients , at doses of the immediate ‑ release formulation of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly , some nonlinearity was observed in both populations , again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway ( Figure 3 ) .
Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration .
The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation , which are readily cleared .
Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate , and major metabolites have been isolated and identified .
Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1 / 50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake .
The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6 .
Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment .
The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug ‑ drug interactions [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Excretion Approximately 64 % of a 30 ‑ mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2 % as the parent compound and 62 % as metabolites over a 10 ‑ day post ‑ dosing period .
About 36 % was excreted in the feces ( probably via the bile ) , mostly as metabolites and less than 1 % as the parent compound over the 10 ‑ day post ‑ dosing period .
The elimination half - life is approximately 15 to 20 hours after a single dose of Paroxetine HCL CR .
Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6 , and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces .
Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 ( poor metabolizers ) .
Drug Interaction Studies There are clinically significant , known drug interactions between paroxetine and other drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Figure 1 .
Impact of Paroxetine on the Pharmacokinetics of Co - Administered Drugs ( log scale ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 2 .
Impact of Co - Administered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Paroxetine [ MULTIMEDIA ] Theophylline : Reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with immediate ‑ release paroxetine treatment have been reported .
While this interaction has not been formally studied , it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are concurrently administered .
Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4 An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady ‑ state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine , a substrate forCYP3A4 , revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics .
In addition , in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity , to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme , including terfenadine , astemizole , cisapride , triazolam , and cyclosporine .
Paroxetine ’ s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not expected to be of clinical significance .
Specific Populations The impact of specific populations on the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine are shown in Figure 3 Figure 3 .
Impact of Specific Population on the Pharmacokinetics of Paroxetine ( log scale ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Two ‑ year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rodents given paroxetine in the diet at 1 , 5 , and 25 mg / kg / day ( mice ) and 1 , 5 , and 20 mg / kg / day ( rats ) .
These doses are up to approximately 1 . 6 ( mouse ) and 2 . 5 ( rat ) times the MRHD on an mg / m2 basis .
There was a significantly greater number of male rats in the high ‑ dose group with reticulum cell sarcomas ( 1 / 100 , 0 / 50 , 0 / 50 , and 4 / 50 for control , low ‑ , middle ‑ , and high ‑ dose groups , respectively ) and a significantly increased linear trend across dose groups for the occurrence of lymphoreticular tumors in male rats .
Female rats were not affected .
Although there was a dose ‑ related increase in the number of tumors in mice , there was no drug ‑ related increase in the number of mice with tumors .
The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown .
Mutagenesis Paroxetine produced no genotoxic effects in a battery of 5 in vitro and 2 in vivo assays that included the following : Bacterial mutation assay , mouse lymphoma mutation assay , unscheduled DNA synthesis assay , and tests for cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human lymphocytes and in a dominant lethal test in rats .
Impairment of Fertility Some clinical studies have shown that SSRIs ( including paroxetine ) may affect sperm quality during SSRI treatment , which may affect fertility in some men .
A reduced pregnancy rate was found in reproduction studies in rats at a dose of paroxetine of 15 mg / kg / day , which is approximately twice the MRHD on an mg / m2 basis .
Irreversible lesions occurred in the reproductive tract of male rats after dosing in toxicity studies for 2 to 52 weeks .
These lesions consisted of vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium at 50 mg / kg / day and atrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrested spermatogenesis at 25 mg / kg / day ( approximately 6 and 3 times the MRHD on an mg / m2 basis ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Major Depressive Disorder The efficacy of Paroxetine HCL CR as a treatment for major depressive disorder ( MDD ) was established in two 12 ‑ week , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo ‑ controlled , flexible dose studies with Paroxetine HCL CR ( Study 1 and Study 2 ) in adult patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) ‑ IV criteria for MDD .
Study 1 and 2 included patients 18 to 65 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR doses of 25 to 62 . 5 mg / day ( N = 212 ) or placebo ( N = 211 ) once daily compared to immediate - release paroxetine 20 to 50 mg ( N = 217 ) .
A third 12 - week , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo ‑ controlled , flexible dose study with Paroxetine HCL CR ( Study 3 ) included elderly patients , ranging in age from 60 to 88 years old and used Paroxetine HCL CR doses of 12 . 5 to 50 mg / day ( N = 104 ) or placebo ( N = 109 ) once daily compared to immediate - release paroxetine 10 to 40 mg ( N = 106 ) .
In all three studies , Paroxetine HCL CR was statistically superior to placebo in improving depressive symptoms as measured by the following : the mean change from baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) total score at Week 12 , the mean change from baseline in the Hamilton Depressed Mood item score at Week 12 , and the mean change from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) – Severity of Illness score .
Long - term efficacy of paroxetine for treatment of MDD in outpatients was established with one randomized withdrawal study with immediate - release paroxetine .
Patients who responded to immediate ‑ release paroxetine ( HDRS total score < 8 ) during an initial 8 ‑ week open ‑ label treatment phase were then randomized to continue immediate ‑ release paroxetine or placebo , for up to 1 year .
Patients treated with immediate ‑ release paroxetine demonstrated a statistically significant lower relapse rate during the withdrawal phase ( 15 % ) compared to those on placebo ( 39 % ) .
Effectiveness was similar for male and female patients .
14 . 2 Panic Disorder The effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR in the treatment of panic disorder ( PD ) was evaluated in three 10 ‑ week , multicenter , flexible ‑ dose studies ( Studies 4 , 5 , and 6 ) comparing Paroxetine HCL CR ( 12 . 5 to 75 mg daily ) to placebo in adult outpatients 19 to 72 years of age who met panic disorder ( with or without agoraphobia ) criteria according to DSM ‑ IV .
These trials were assessed on the basis of their outcomes on 3 variables : ( 1 ) the proportions of patients free of full panic attacks at Week 10 ; ( 2 ) change from baseline to Week 10 in the median number of full panic attacks ; and ( 3 ) change from baseline to Week 10 in the median Clinical Global Impression Severity score .
For Studies 4 and 5 , Paroxetine HCL CR was superior to placebo on 2 of these 3 variables .
Study 6 failed to consistently demonstrate a statistically significant difference between Paroxetine HCL CR and placebo on any of these variables .
For all 3 studies , the mean dose of Paroxetine HCL CR for completers at Week 10 was approximately 50 mg / day .
Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender .
Long ‑ term maintenance effects of paroxetine in patients with PD were demonstrated in a randomized - withdrawal study using immediate ‑ release paroxetine .
Patients who were responders during a 10 ‑ week , double ‑ blind trial ( followed by a 3 - month double - blind maintenance phase ) of immediate ‑ release paroxetine were re - randomized to continue immediate ‑ release paroxetine or placebo in a 3 ‑ month , double ‑ blind withdrawal phase .
Patients randomized to immediate - release paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo - treated patients .
14 . 3 Social Anxiety Disorder The efficacy of Paroxetine HCL CR as a treatment for social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) was established , in part , on the basis of extrapolation from the established effectiveness of immediate ‑ release paroxetine in the treatment of SAD .
In addition , the effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR in the treatment of SAD was demonstrated in one 12 ‑ week , multicenter , double ‑ blind , flexible ‑ dose , placebo ‑ controlled study of adult outpatients with a primary diagnosis of SAD by DSM ‑ IV criteria ( Study 7 ) .
In Study 7 , the effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR ( 12 . 5 to 37 . 5 mg daily ) compared to placebo was evaluated on the basis of ( 1 ) change from baseline in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale ( LSAS ) total score at Week 12 and ( 2 ) the proportion of responders who scored 1 or 2 ( very much improved or much improved ) on the CGI Global Improvement score at Week 12 .
In Study 7 , Paroxetine HCL CR demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on both the change on LSAS total score at Week 12 and the CGI Improvement responder criterion at Week 12 .
For patients who completed the trial , 64 % of patients treated with Paroxetine HCL CR compared to 35 % of patients treated with placebo were CGI Improvement responders at Week 12 .
Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of gender .
Subgroup analyses of studies utilizing the immediate ‑ release formulation of paroxetine generally did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age , race , or gender .
14 . 4 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder The effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR for the treatment of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder ( PMDD ) utilizing a continuous dosing regimen has been established in 2 placebo ‑ controlled trials in female patients ages 18 to 46 ( Studies 8 and 9 [ N = 672 ] ) .
Patients in these trials met DSM ‑ IV criteria for PMDD .
Of 1 , 030 patients including Study 10 , who were treated with daily doses of Paroxetine HCL CR 12 . 5 or 25 mg / day , or placebo continuously throughout the menstrual cycle for a period of 3 menstrual cycles , the mean duration of the PMDD symptoms was approximately 11 ± 7 years .
Patients on systemic hormonal contraceptives were excluded from these trials .
Therefore , the efficacy of Paroxetine HCL CR in combination with systemic ( including oral ) hormonal contraceptives for the continuous daily treatment of PMDD is unknown .
The VAS score is a patient ‑ rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria of PMDD as identified in the DSM ‑ IV , and includes assessments for mood , physical symptoms , and other symptoms associated with PMDD .
