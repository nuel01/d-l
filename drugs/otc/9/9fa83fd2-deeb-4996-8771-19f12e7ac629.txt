1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE EpiPen and EpiPen Jr are indicated in the emergency treatment of allergic reactions ( Type I ) including anaphylaxis to stinging insects ( e . g . , order Hymenoptera , which include bees , wasps , hornets , yellow jackets and fire ants ) and biting insects ( e . g . , triatoma , mosquitoes ) , allergen immunotherapy , foods , drugs , diagnostic testing substances ( e . g . , radiocontrast media ) and other allergens , as well as idiopathic anaphylaxis or exercise - induced anaphylaxis .
EpiPen and EpiPen Jr are intended for immediate administration in patients who are determined to be at increased risk for anaphylaxis , including individuals with a history of anaphylactic reactions .
Anaphylactic reactions may occur within minutes after exposure and consist of flushing , apprehension , syncope , tachycardia , thready or unobtainable pulse associated with a fall in blood pressure , convulsions , vomiting , diarrhea and abdominal cramps , involuntary voiding , wheezing , dyspnea due to laryngeal spasm , pruritus , rashes , urticaria or angioedema .
EpiPen and EpiPen Jr are intended for immediate administration as emergency supportive therapy only and are not a substitute for immediate medical care .
EpiPen and EpiPen Jr contain epinephrine , a non - selective alpha and beta - adrenergic receptor agonist , indicated in the emergency treatment of allergic reactions ( Type I ) including anaphylaxis .
( ) 1 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Selection of the appropriate dosage strength ( EpiPen 0 . 3 mg or EpiPen Jr 0 . 15 mg ) is determined according to patient body weight .
• Patients greater than or equal to 30 kg ( approximately 66 pounds or more ) : EpiPen 0 . 3 mg • • Patients 15 to 30 kg ( 33 pounds to 66 pounds ) : EpiPen Jr 0 . 15 mg • Inject EpiPen or EpiPen Jr intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh , through clothing if necessary .
Each EpiPen or EpiPen Jr contains a single dose of epinephrine for single - use injection .
Since the doses of epinephrine delivered from EpiPen or EpiPen Jr are fixed , consider using other forms of injectable epinephrine if doses lower than 0 . 15 mg are deemed necessary .
The prescriber should carefully assess each patient to determine the most appropriate dose of epinephrine , recognizing the life - threatening nature of the reactions for which this drug is indicated .
With severe persistent anaphylaxis , repeat injections with an additional EpiPen or EpiPen Jr may be necessary .
More than two sequential doses of epinephrine should only be administered under direct medical supervision [ ] .
see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) The epinephrine solution in the clear window of the EpiPen Auto - Injector should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration .
Epinephrine is light sensitive and should be stored in the carrier tube provided to protect it from light [ ] see How Supplied / Storage and Handling ( 16 . 2 ) .

( ) • 5 . 2 • The presence of a sulfite in this product should not deter use .
( ) • 5 . 3 • Administer with caution in patients with heart disease ; may aggravate angina pectoris or produce ventricular arrhythmias .
( ) • 5 . 4 5 . 1 Emergency Treatment EpiPen and EpiPen Jr are intended for immediate administration as emergency supportive therapy and are not intended as a substitute for immediate medical care .
More than two sequential doses of epinephrine should only be administered under direct medical supervision [ ] .
In conjunction with the administration of epinephrine , the patient should seek immediate medical or hospital care . see , and Indications and Usage ( 1 ) Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) 5 . 2 Incorrect Locations of Injection EpiPen and EpiPen Jr should be injected into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh [ ] .
onlysee and Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) • Large doses or accidental intravenous injection of epinephrine may result in cerebral hemorrhage due to sharp rise in blood pressure .
Rapidly acting vasodilators can counteract the marked pressor effects of epinephrine if there is such inadvertent administration .
• Do not inject intravenously .
• Injection into the buttock may not provide effective treatment of anaphylaxis .
Advise the patient to go immediately to the nearest emergency room for further treatment of anaphylaxis .
Additionally , injection into the buttock has been associated with gas gangrene .
Cleansing with alcohol does not kill bacterial spores , and therefore , does not lower this risk .
• Do not inject into buttock .
• Since epinephrine is a strong vasoconstrictor , accidental injection into the digits , hands or feet may result in loss of blood flow to the affected area .
Advise the patient to go immediately to the nearest emergency room and to inform the healthcare provider in the emergency room of the location of the accidental injection .
Treatment of such inadvertent administration should consist of vasodilation , in addition to further appropriate treatment of anaphylaxis [ ] .
• Do not inject into digits , hands or feet . see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) 5 . 3 Allergic Reactions Associated With Sulfite The presence of a sulfite in this product should not deter administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations even if the patient is sulfite - sensitive .
Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic reactions or other emergency situations even though this product contains sodium metabisulfite , a sulfite that may , in other products , cause allergic - type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms or life - threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible persons .
The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life - threatening situation may not be satisfactory .
5 . 4 Disease Interactions Some patients may be at greater risk for developing adverse reactions after epinephrine administration .
Despite these concerns , it should be recognized that the presence of these conditions is not a contraindication to epinephrine administration in an acute , life - threatening situation .
Therefore , patients with these conditions , and / or any other person who might be in a position to administer EpiPen or EpiPen Jr to a patient experiencing anaphylaxis should be carefully instructed in regard to the circumstances under which epinephrine should be used .
• Patients with Heart Disease • Epinephrine should be administered with caution to patients who have heart disease , including patients with cardiac arrhythmias , coronary artery or organic heart disease , or hypertension In such patients , or in patients who are on drugs that may sensitize the heart to arrhythmias epinephrine may precipitate or aggravate angina pectoris as well as produce ventricular arrhythmias [ ] .
.
, see and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) • Other Patients and Diseases • Epinephrine should be administered with caution to patients with hyperthyroidism , diabetes , elderly individuals , and pregnant women .
Patients with Parkinson ’ s disease may notice a temporary worsening of symptoms .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to the lack of randomized , controlled clinical trials of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis , the true incidence of adverse reactions associated with the systemic use of epinephrine is difficult to determine .
Adverse reactions reported in observational trials , case reports , and studies are listed below .
Common adverse reactions to systemically administered epinephrine include anxiety ; apprehensiveness ; restlessness ; tremor ; weakness ; dizziness ; sweating ; palpitations ; pallor ; nausea and vomiting ; headache ; and / or respiratory difficulties .
These symptoms occur in some persons receiving therapeutic doses of epinephrine , but are more likely to occur in patients with hypertension or hyperthyroidism [ ] .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Patients who receive epinephrine while concomitantly taking cardiac glycosides , diuretics , or anti - arrhythmics should be observed carefully for the development of cardiac arrhythmias [ ] .
see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) The effects of epinephrine may be potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants , monoamine oxidase inhibitors , levothyroxine sodium , and certain antihistamines , notably chlorpheniramine , tripelennamine , and diphenhydramine .
The cardiostimulating and bronchodilating effects of epinephrine are antagonized by beta - adrenergic blocking drugs , such as propranolol .
The vasoconstricting and hypertensive effects of epinephrine are antagonized by alpha - adrenergic blocking drugs , such as phentolamine .
Ergot alkaloids may also reverse the pressor effects of epinephrine .
• Cardiac glycosides or diuretics : observe for development of cardiac arrhythmias .
( ) • 7 • Tricyclic antidepressants , monoamine oxidase inhibitors , levothyroxine sodium , and certain antihistamines : potentiate effects of epinephrine .
( ) • 7 • Beta - adrenergic blocking drugs : antagonize cardiostimulating and bronchodilating effects of epinephrine .
( ) • 7 • Alpha - adrenergic blocking drugs : antagonize vasoconstricting and hypertensive effects of epinephrine .
( ) • 7 • Ergot alkaloids : may reverse the pressor effects of epinephrine .
( ) • 7 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing adverse reactions .
( , ) • 5 . 48 . 5 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C . .
There are no adequate and well controlled studies of the acute effect of epinephrine in pregnant women .
Epinephrine was teratogenic in rabbits , mice and hamsters .
Epinephrine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus ( fetal anoxia , spontaneous abortion , or both ) .
Epinephrine has been shown to have teratogenic effects when administered subcutaneously in rabbits at approximately 30 times the maximum recommended daily subcutaneous or intramuscular dose ( on a mg / m basis at a maternal dose of 1 . 2 mg / kg / day for two to three days ) , in mice at approximately 7 times the maximum daily subcutaneous or intramuscular dose ( on a mg / m basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 1 mg / kg / day for 10 days ) , and in hamsters at approximately 5 times the maximum recommended daily subcutaneous or intramuscular dose ( on a mg / m basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day for 4 days ) .
222 These effects were not seen in mice at approximately 3 times the maximum recommended daily subcutaneous or intramuscular dose ( on a mg / m basis at a subcutaneous maternal dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day for 10 days ) .
2 8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether epinephrine is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when EpiPen is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use EpiPen or EpiPen Jr may be administered to pediatric patients at a dosage appropriate to body weight [ ] Clinical experience with the use of epinephrine suggests that the adverse reactions seen in children are similar in nature and extent to those both expected and reported in adults .
Since the doses of epinephrine delivered from EpiPen and EpiPen Jr are fixed , consider using other forms of injectable epinephrine if doses lower than 0 . 15 mg are deemed necessary .
see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies for the treatment of anaphylaxis have not been performed in subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
However , other reported clinical experience with use of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis has identified that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to the effects of epinephrine .
Therefore , EpiPen should be administered with caution in elderly individuals , who may be at greater risk for developing adverse reactions after epinephrine administration [ ] .
see , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) Overdosage ( 10 ) 10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of epinephrine may produce extremely elevated arterial pressure , which may result in cerebrovascular hemorrhage , particularly in elderly patients .
Overdosage may also result in pulmonary edema because of peripheral vascular constriction together with cardiac stimulation .
Treatment consists of rapidly acting vasodilators or alpha - adrenergic blocking drugs and / or respiratory support .
Epinephrine overdosage can also cause transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia , and these may be accompanied by potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias .
Premature ventricular contractions may appear within one minute after injection and may be followed by multifocal ventricular tachycardia ( prefibrillation rhythm ) .
Subsidence of the ventricular effects may be followed by atrial tachycardia and occasionally by atrioventricular block .
Treatment of arrhythmias consists of administration of a beta - adrenergic blocking drug such as propranolol .
Overdosage sometimes results in extreme pallor and coldness of the skin , metabolic acidosis , and kidney failure .
Suitable corrective measures must be taken in such situations .

[ ] .
see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Epinephrine acts on both alpha - and beta - adrenergic receptors .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Through its action on alpha - adrenergic receptors , epinephrine lessens the vasodilation and increased vascular permeability that occurs during anaphylaxis , which can lead to loss of intravascular fluid volume and hypotension .
Through its action on beta - adrenergic receptors , epinephrine causes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and helps alleviate bronchospasm , wheezing and dyspnea that may occur during anaphylaxis .
Epinephrine also alleviates pruritus , urticaria , and angioedema and may relieve gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms associated with anaphylaxis because of its relaxer effects on the smooth muscle of the stomach , intestine , uterus and urinary bladder .
When given subcutaneously or intramuscularly , epinephrine has a rapid onset and short duration of action .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of epinephrine have not been conducted .
Epinephrine and other catecholamines have been shown to have mutagenic potential and to be an oxidative mutagen in a bacterial reverse mutation assay .
in vitroWP2 Epinephrine was positive in the DNA Repair test with ( REC ) assay , but was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay .
B . subtilisSalmonella The potential for epinephrine to impair fertility has not been evaluated .
This should not prevent the use of epinephrine under the conditions noted under .
