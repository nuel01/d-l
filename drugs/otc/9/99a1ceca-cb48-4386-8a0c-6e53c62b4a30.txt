LOVAZA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity ( e . g . , anaphylactic reaction ) to LOVAZA or any of its components .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • In patients with hepatic impairment , monitor ALT and AST levels periodically during therapy .
( 5 . 1 ) • • LOVAZA may increase levels of LDL .
Monitor LDL levels periodically during therapy .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Use with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and / or shellfish .
( 5 . 2 ) • • There is a possible association between LOVAZA and more frequent recurrences of symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation , particularly within the first months of initiating therapy .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Monitoring : Laboratory Tests In patients with hepatic impairment , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with LOVAZA .
In some patients , increases in ALT levels without a concurrent increase in AST levels were observed .
In some patients , LOVAZA increases LDL - C levels .
LDL - C levels should be monitored periodically during therapy with LOVAZA .
Laboratory studies should be performed periodically to measure the patient ’ s TG levels during therapy with LOVAZA .
5 . 2 Fish Allergy LOVAZA contains ethyl esters of omega - 3 fatty acids ( EPA and DHA ) obtained from the oil of several fish sources .
It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and / or shellfish , are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to LOVAZA .
LOVAZA should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and / or shellfish .
5 . 3 Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) or Flutter In a double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of 663 subjects with symptomatic paroxysmal AF ( n = 542 ) or persistent AF ( n = 121 ) , recurrent AF or flutter was observed in subjects randomized to LOVAZA who received 8 grams per day for 7 days and 4 grams per day thereafter for 23 weeks at a higher rate relative to placebo .
Subjects in this trial had median baseline triglycerides of 127 mg per dL , had no substantial structural heart disease , were taking no anti - arrhythmic therapy ( rate control permitted ) , and were in normal sinus rhythm at baseline .
At 24 weeks , in the paroxysmal AF stratum , there were 129 ( 47 % ) first recurrent symptomatic AF or flutter events on placebo and 141 ( 53 % ) on LOVAZA [ primary endpoint , HR 1 . 19 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 93 , 1 . 35 ] .
In the persistent AF stratum , there were 19 ( 35 % ) events on placebo and 34 ( 52 % ) events on LOVAZA [ HR 1 . 63 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 91 , 2 . 18 ] .
For both strata combined , the HR was 1 . 25 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 00 , 1 . 40 .
Although the clinical significance of these results is uncertain , there is a possible association between LOVAZA and more frequent recurrences of symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation , particularly within the first 2 to 3 months of initiating therapy .
LOVAZA is not indicated for the treatment of AF or flutter .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions ( incidence > 3 % and greater than placebo ) were eructation , dyspepsia , and taste perversion .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials , the events described below have been identified during post - approval use of LOVAZA .
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to always establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following events have been reported : anaphylactic reaction , hemorrhagic diathesis .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Omega - 3 - acids may prolong bleeding time .
Patients taking LOVAZA and an anticoagulant or other drug affecting coagulation ( e . g . , anti - platelet agents ) should be monitored periodically .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Anticoagulants or Other Drugs Affecting Coagulation Some trials with omega - 3 - acids demonstrated prolongation of bleeding time .
The prolongation of bleeding time reported in these trials has not exceeded normal limits and did not produce clinically significant bleeding episodes .
Clinical trials have not been done to thoroughly examine the effect of LOVAZA and concomitant anticoagulants .
Patients receiving treatment with LOVAZA and an anticoagulant or other drug affecting coagulation ( e . g . , anti - platelet agents ) should be monitored periodically .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Pregnancy : Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
( 8 . 1 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C : There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
It is unknown whether LOVAZA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity .
LOVAZA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the patient justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Animal Data Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters have been shown to have an embryocidal effect in pregnant rats when given in doses resulting in exposures 7 times the recommended human dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison .
In female rats given oral gavage doses of 100 , 600 , and 2 , 000 mg per kg per day beginning 2 weeks prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation , no adverse effects were observed in the high - dose group ( 5 times human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on body surface area comparison ) .
In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 1 , 000 , 3 , 000 , and 6 , 000 mg per kg per day from gestation Day 6 through 15 , no adverse effects were observed ( 14 times human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 100 , 600 , and 2 , 000 mg per kg per day from gestation Day 14 through lactation Day 21 , no adverse effects were seen at 2 , 000 mg per kg per day ( 5 times the human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
However , decreased live births ( 20 % reduction ) and decreased survival to postnatal Day 4 ( 40 % reduction ) were observed in a dose - ranging study using higher doses of 3 , 000 mg per kg per day ( 7 times the human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 375 , 750 , and 1 , 500 mg per kg per day from gestation Day 7 through 19 , no findings were observed in the fetuses in groups given 375 mg per kg per day ( 2 times human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
However , at higher doses , evidence of maternal toxicity was observed ( 4 times human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Studies with omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters have demonstrated excretion in human milk .
The effect of this excretion on the infant of a nursing mother is unknown ; caution should be exercised when LOVAZA is administered to a nursing mother .
An animal study in lactating rats given oral gavage 14 C - ethyl EPA demonstrated that drug levels were 6 to 14 times higher in milk than in plasma .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use A limited number of subjects older than 65 years were enrolled in the clinical trials of LOVAZA .
Safety and efficacy findings in subjects older than 60 years did not appear to differ from those of subjects younger than 60 years .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE LOVAZA does not have any known drug abuse or withdrawal effects .
11 DESCRIPTION LOVAZA , a lipid - regulating agent , is supplied as a liquid - filled gel capsule for oral administration .
Each 1 - gram capsule of LOVAZA contains at least 900 mg of the ethyl esters of omega - 3 fatty acids sourced from fish oils .
These are predominantly a combination of ethyl esters of eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA — approximately 465 mg ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA — approximately 375 mg ) .
The empirical formula of EPA ethyl ester is C22H34O2 , and the molecular weight of EPA ethyl ester is 330 . 51 .
The structural formula of EPA ethyl ester is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The empirical formula of DHA ethyl ester is C24H36O2 , and the molecular weight of DHA ethyl ester is 356 . 55 .
The structural formula of DHA ethyl ester is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] LOVAZA capsules also contain the following inactive ingredients : 4 mg α - tocopherol ( in a carrier of soybean oil ) , and gelatin , glycerol , and purified water ( components of the capsule shell ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of LOVAZA is not completely understood .
Potential mechanisms of action include inhibition of acyl - CoA : 1 , 2 - diacylglycerol acyltransferase , increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal β - oxidation in the liver , decreased lipogenesis in the liver , and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity .
LOVAZA may reduce the synthesis of triglycerides in the liver because EPA and DHA are poor substrates for the enzymes responsible for TG synthesis , and EPA and DHA inhibit esterification of other fatty acids .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers and in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia , EPA and DHA were absorbed when administered as ethyl esters orally .
Omega - 3 - acids administered as ethyl esters ( LOVAZA ) induced significant , dose - dependent increases in serum phospholipid EPA content , though increases in DHA content were less marked and not dose - dependent when administered as ethyl esters .
Specific Populations Age : Uptake of EPA and DHA into serum phospholipids in subjects treated with LOVAZA was independent of age ( younger than 49 years versus 49 years and older ) .
Gender : Females tended to have more uptake of EPA into serum phospholipids than males .
The clinical significance of this is unknown .
Pediatric : Pharmacokinetics of LOVAZA have not been studied .
Renal or Hepatic Impairment : LOVAZA has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment .
Drug - Drug Interactions Simvastatin : In a 14 - day trial of 24 healthy adult subjects , daily coadministration of simvastatin 80 mg with LOVAZA 4 grams did not affect the extent ( AUC ) or rate ( Cmax ) of exposure to simvastatin or the major active metabolite , beta - hydroxy simvastatin , at steady state .
Atorvastatin : In a 14 - day trial of 50 healthy adult subjects , daily coadministration of atorvastatin 80 mg with LOVAZA 4 grams did not affect AUC or Cmax of exposure to atorvastatin , 2 - hydroxyatorvastatin , or 4 - hydroxyatorvastatin at steady state .
Rosuvastatin : In a 14 - day trial of 48 healthy adult subjects , daily coadministration of rosuvastatin 40 mg with LOVAZA 4 grams did not affect AUC or Cmax of exposure to rosuvastatin at steady state .
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that clinically significant cytochrome P450 - mediated inhibition by EPA / DHA combinations are not expected in humans .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a rat carcinogenicity study with oral gavage doses of 100 , 600 , and 2 , 000 mg per kg per day , males were treated with omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters for 101 weeks and females for 89 weeks without an increased incidence of tumors ( up to 5 times human systemic exposures following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
Standard lifetime carcinogenicity bioassays were not conducted in mice .
Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters were not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis ( Ames ) test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli or in the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster V79 lung cells or human lymphocytes .
Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters were negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
In a rat fertility study with oral gavage doses of 100 , 600 , and 2 , 000 mg per kg per day , males were treated for 10 weeks prior to mating and females were treated for 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating , gestation , and lactation .
No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 2 , 000 mg per kg per day ( 5 times human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia The effects of LOVAZA 4 grams per day were assessed in 2 randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind , parallel - group trials of 84 adult subjects ( 42 on LOVAZA , 42 on placebo ) with very high triglyceride levels .
Subjects whose baseline triglyceride levels were between 500 and 2 , 000 mg per dL were enrolled in these 2 trials of 6 and 16 weeks ’ duration .
The median triglyceride and LDL - C levels in these subjects were 792 mg per dL and 100 mg per dL , respectively .
Median HDL - C level was 23 . 0 mg per dL .
The changes in the major lipoprotein lipid parameters for the groups receiving LOVAZA or placebo are shown in Table 2 .
Table 2 .

LOVAZA 4 grams per day reduced median TG , VLDL - C , and non - HDL - C levels and increased median HDL - C from baseline relative to placebo .
Treatment with LOVAZA to reduce very high TG levels may result in elevations in LDL - C and non - HDL - C in some individuals .
Patients should be monitored to ensure that the LDL - C level does not increase excessively .
The effect of LOVAZA on the risk of pancreatitis has not been determined .
The effect of LOVAZA on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity has not been determined .
