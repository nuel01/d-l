6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Acute and Chronic Hyperammonemia due to NAGS Deficiency In a retrospective case series of 23 NAGS deficiency patients treated with Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension , 17 of the 23 patients reported any adverse reaction .
The most common adverse reactions ( occurring in ≥ 13 % of patients ) were vomiting , abdominal pain , pyrexia , tonsillitis , anemia , diarrhea , ear infection , infections , nasopharyngitis , hemoglobin decreased , and headache .
Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions occurring in 2 or more patients with NAGS deficiency treated with carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension in the retrospective case series ( ≥ 9 % ) .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥ 2 Patients with NAGS deficiency Treated with Carglumic Acid Tablets for Oral Suspension in the Retrospective Case Series Adverse Reaction Number of Patients ( N ) ( % ) Vomiting 6 ( 26 ) Abdominal pain 4 ( 17 ) Pyrexia 4 ( 17 ) Tonsillitis 4 ( 17 ) Anemia 3 ( 13 ) Diarrhea 3 ( 13 ) Ear infection 3 ( 13 ) Infections 3 ( 13 ) Nasopharyngitis 3 ( 13 ) Hemoglobin decreased 3 ( 13 ) Headache 3 ( 13 ) Dysgeusia 2 ( 9 ) Asthenia 2 ( 9 ) Hyperhidrosis 2 ( 9 ) Influenza 2 ( 9 ) Pneumonia 2 ( 9 ) Weight decreased 2 ( 9 ) Anorexia 2 ( 9 ) Somnolence 2 ( 9 ) Rash 2 ( 9 ) 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Psychiatric disorders : mania Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : pruritus , rash including rash erythematous , rash maculopapular , rash pustular 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Although rare case reports of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes , untreated NAGS deficiency can result in irreversible neurologic damage and death in pregnant women [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
In an animal reproduction study , decreased survival and growth occurred in offspring born to rats that received carglumic acid at a dose approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , miscarriage , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Pregnant women with urea cycle disorders may experience an increase in catabolic stress which can trigger a hyperammonemic crisis both in the intrapartum and in the post - partum ( 3 to 14 days post - partum ) periods .
Maternal complications related to hyperammonemic crisis can include neurological impairment , coma and in some cases death .
Data Animal Data No effects on embryo - fetal development were observed in pregnant rats treated with up to 2000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [ 100 mg / kg / day ] based on AUC [ area under the plasma concentration - time curve ] ) from two weeks prior to mating through organogenesis or in pregnant rabbits treated with up to 1000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 6 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [ 100 mg / kg / day ] based on AUC ) during organogenesis .
In a pre - and post - natal developmental study , female rats received oral carglumic acid from organogenesis through lactation at doses of 500 mg / kg / day and 2000 mg / kg / day .
Decreased growth of offspring was observed at 500 mg / kg / day and higher ( approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [ 100 mg / kg / day ] based on AUC ) , and reduction in offspring survival during lactation was observed at 2000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [ 100 mg / kg / day ] based on AUC ) .
No effects on physical and sexual development , learning and memory , or reproductive performance were observed through maturation of the surviving offspring at maternal doses up to 2000 mg / kg / day .
The high dose ( 2000 mg / kg / day ) produced maternal toxicity ( impaired weight gain and approximately 10 % mortality ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether carglumic acid is present in human milk .
There are no available data on the effects of carglumic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Carglumic acid is present in milk from treated rats .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension for the treatment of pediatric patients ( birth to 17 years of age ) with acute or chronic hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency have been established , and the information on these uses are discussed throughout the labeling .
There are insufficient data to determine if there is a difference in clinical or biochemical responses between adult and pediatric patients treated with Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension did not include patients 65 years of age and older .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Plasma concentrations of carglumic acid increased in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Reduce the carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension dosage in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid have not been evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease .
10 OVERDOSAGE One patient treated with 650 mg / kg / day of Carglumic acid developed symptoms resembling monosodium glutamate intoxication - like syndrome and characterized by tachycardia , profuse sweating , increased bronchial secretion , increased body temperature , and restlessness .
These symptoms resolved upon reduction of dose .
11 DESCRIPTION Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension contain 200 mg of carglumic acid .
Carglumic acid , the active substance , is a carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 ( CPS 1 ) activator and is soluble in dimethyl formamide and sparingly soluble in water .
Chemically , carglumic acid is N - carbamoyl - L - glutamic acid or ( 2 S ) - 2 - ( carbamoylamino ) pentanedioic acid , with a molecular weight of 190 . 16 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Formula : C6H10N2O5 The inactive ingredients of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension are croscarmellose sodium , microcrystalline cellulose , sodium lauryl sulfate , colloidal silicon dioxide and sodium stearyl fumarate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Carglumic acid is a synthetic structural analogue of N - acetylglutamate ( NAG ) which is produced from glutamate and acetyl - CoA in a reaction catalyzed by N - acetylglutamate synthase ( NAGS ) , a mitochondrial liver enzyme .
NAG acts as an essential allosteric activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 ( CPS 1 ) , a mitochondrial liver enzyme which catalyzes the first reaction of the urea cycle .
The urea cycle , whose role is the disposition of ammonia , includes a series of biochemical reactions in the liver resulting in the conversion of ammonia into urea , which is then excreted through the urine .
Carglumic acid acts as a CPS1 activator , improves or restores the function of the urea cycle , and facilitates ammonia detoxification and urea production .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a retrospective review of the clinical course in 23 patients with NAGS deficiency , carglumic acid reduced plasma ammonia levels within 24 hours when administered with and without concomitant ammonia lowering therapies .
No dose - response relationship has been identified .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of carglumic acid was evaluated in a Phase 1 , randomized study in 76 healthy volunteers .
The study suggests a lack of clinically relevant QT prolongation effect at the highest therapeutic dose level ( 250 mg / kg / day ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid in healthy subjects following an intravenous ( IV ) infusion over 2 hours at 8 mg / kg or an oral administration at 100 mg / kg are summarized in Table 3 .
