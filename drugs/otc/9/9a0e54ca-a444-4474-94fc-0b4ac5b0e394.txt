( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myelosuppression : Dexrazoxane for Injection may increase the myelosuppresive effects of chemotherapeutic agents .
Perform hematological monitoring .
( 5 . 1 ) • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential of the potential hazard to the fetus .
( 5 . 5 , 8 . 1 ) 5 . 1 Myelosuppression Dexrazoxane for Injection may add to the myelosuppression caused by chemotherapeutic agents .
Obtain a complete blood count prior to and during each course of therapy , and administer Dexrazoxane for Injection and chemotherapy only when adequate hematologic parameters are met .
5 . 2 Concomitant Chemotherapy Only use Dexrazoxane for Injection in those patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg / m2 and are continuing with doxorubicin therapy .
Do not use with chemotherapy initiation as Dexrazoxane for Injection may interfere with the antitumor activity of the chemotherapy regimen .
In a trial conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with fluorouracil , doxorubicin , and cyclophosphamide ( FAC ) with or without Dexrazoxane for Injection starting with their first cycle of FAC therapy , patients who were randomized to receive Dexrazoxane for Injection had a lower response rate ( 48 % vs . 63 % ) and shorter time to progression than patients who were randomized to receive placebo .
5 . 3 Cardiac Toxicity Treatment with Dexrazoxane for Injection does not completely eliminate the risk of anthracycline - induced cardiac toxicity .
Monitor cardiac function before and periodically during therapy to assess left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) .
In general , if test results indicate deterioration in cardiac function associated with doxorubicin , the benefit of continued therapy should be carefully evaluated against the risk of producing irreversible cardiac damage .
5 . 4 Secondary Malignancies Secondary malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) and myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) have been reported in studies of pediatric patients who have received Dexrazoxane for Injection in combination with chemotherapy .
Dexrazoxane for Injection is not indicated for use in pediatric patients .
Some adult patients who received Dexrazoxane for Injection in combination with anti - cancer agents known to be carcinogenic have also developed secondary malignancies , including AML and MDS .
Razoxane is the racemic mixture , of which dexrazoxane is the S ( + ) - enantiomer .
Secondary malignancies ( primarily acute myeloid leukemia ) have been reported in patients treated chronically with oral razoxane .
In these patients , the total cumulative dose of razoxane ranged from 26 to 480 grams and the duration of treatment was from 42 to 319 weeks .
One case of T - cell lymphoma , one case of B - cell lymphoma , and six to eight cases of cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with razoxane .
Long - term administration of razoxane to rodents was associated with the development of malignancies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 5 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Dexrazoxane for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
Dexrazoxane administration during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity , embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits at doses significantly lower than the clinically recommended dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use highly effective contraception during treatment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS In clinical studies , Dexrazoxane for Injection was administered to patients also receiving chemotherapeutic agents for cancer .
Pain on injection was observed more frequently in patients receiving Dexrazoxane for Injection versus placebo .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Gland Pharma at 864 - 879 - 9994 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The adverse reaction profile described in this section was identified from randomized , placebo controlled , double - blind studies in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received the combination of the FAC chemotherapy regimen with or without Dexrazoxane for Injection .
The dose of doxorubicin was 50 mg / m2 in each of these trials .
Treatment was administered every three weeks until disease progression or cardiac toxicity .
Patients in clinical trials who received FAC with Dexrazoxane for Injection experienced more severe leukopenia , granulocytopenia , and thrombocytopenia than patients receiving FAC without Dexrazoxane for Injection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Table 1 below lists the incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving FAC with either Dexrazoxane for Injection or placebo in the breast cancer studies .
Adverse experiences occurring during courses 1 through 6 are displayed for patients receiving Dexrazoxane for Injection or placebo with FAC beginning with their first course of therapy ( columns 1 and 3 , respectively ) .
Adverse experiences occurring at course 7 and beyond for patients who received placebo with FAC during the first six courses and who then received either Dexrazoxane for Injection or placebo with FAC are also displayed ( columns 2 and 4 , respectively ) .
The adverse reactions listed below in Table . 1 demonstrate that the frequency of adverse reaction “ Pain on Injection ” has been greater for Dexrazoxane for Injection arm , as compared to placebo .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Nursing Mothers : Discontinue drug or nursing .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Risk Summary Dexrazoxane for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
Dexrazoxane administration resulted in maternal toxicity , embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits at doses significantly lower than the clinically recommended dose .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Animal Data Dexrazoxane resulted in maternal toxicity in rats at doses of ≥ 2 mg / kg ( 1 / 40 the human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) and embryotoxicity and teratogenicity at 8 mg / kg ( approximately 1 / 10 the human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) when given daily to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis .
Teratogenic effects in the rat included imperforate anus , microphthalmia , and anophthalmia .
In offspring allowed to develop to maturity , fertility was impaired in the male and female rats treated in utero during organogenesis at 8 mg / kg .
In rabbits , doses of ≥ 5 mg / kg ( approximately 1 / 10 the human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) daily during the period of organogenesis caused maternal toxicity and doses of 20 mg / kg ( 1 / 2 the human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) were embryotoxic and teratogenic .
Teratogenic effects in the rabbit included several skeletal malformations such as short tail , rib and thoracic malformations , and soft tissue variations including subcutaneous , eye and cardiac hemorrhagic areas , as well as agenesis of the gallbladder and of the intermediate lobe of the lung .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether dexrazoxane or its metabolites are excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from dexrazoxane , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dexrazoxane in pediatric patients have not been established [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Dexrazoxane for Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Females of Reproductive Potential Contraception Dexrazoxane for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment Greater exposure to dexrazoxane may occur in patients with compromised renal function .
Reduce the Dexrazoxane for Injection dose by 50 % in patients with creatinine clearance values < 40 mL / min [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There are no data on overdosage in the cardioprotective trials ; the maximum dose administered during the cardioprotective trials was 1000 mg / m2 every three weeks .
Disposition studies with Dexrazoxane for Injection have not been conducted in cancer patients undergoing dialysis , but retention of a significant dose fraction ( > 0 . 4 ) of the unchanged drug in the plasma pool , minimal tissue partitioning or binding , and availability of greater than 90 % of the systemic drug levels in the unbound form suggest that it could be removed using conventional peritoneal or hemodialysis .
There is no known antidote for dexrazoxane .
Instances of suspected overdose should be managed with good supportive care until resolution of myelosuppression and related conditions is complete .
Management of overdose should include treatment of infections , fluid regulation , and maintenance of nutritional requirements .
11 DESCRIPTION Dexrazoxane for injection , a cardioprotective agent for use in conjunction with doxorubicin , is a sterile , pyrogen - free lyophilizate intended for intravenous administration .
Chemically , dexrazoxane is ( S ) - 4 , 4 ' - ( 1 - methyl - 1 , 2 - ethanediyl ) bis - 2 , 6 - piperazinedione .
The structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] C11H16N4O4 M . W . 268 . 28 Dexrazoxane , an intracellular chelating agent , is a derivative of EDTA .
Dexrazoxane is a whitish crystalline powder that melts at 191 ° to 197 ° C .
It is sparingly soluble in water and 0 . 1 N HCl , slightly soluble in ethanol and methanol , and practically insoluble in nonpolar organic solvents .
The pKa is 2 . 1 .
Dexrazoxane has an octanol / water partition coefficient of 0 . 025 and degrades rapidly above a pH of 7 . 0 .
Each 500 mg vial contains dexrazoxane hydrochloride equivalent to 500 mg dexrazoxane .
Hydrochloric Acid , NF is added for pH adjustment .
When reconstituted as directed with 50 mL of Sterile Water for Injection , USP , each mL contains : 10 mg dexrazoxane .
The pH of the resultant solution is 1 . 0 to 3 . 0 .
The reconstituted Dexrazoxane for Injection solutions prepared from Sterile Water for Injection , USP , are intended for further dilution with Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection , USP , for rapid intravenous drip infusion .
DO NOT ADMINISTER VIA AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which Dexrazoxane for Injection exerts its cytoprotective activity is not fully understood .
Dexrazoxane is a cyclic derivative of EDTA that penetrates cell membranes .
Results of laboratory studies suggest that dexrazoxane is converted intracellularly to a ring - opened chelating agent that interferes with iron - mediated free radical generation thought to be responsible , in part , for anthracycline - induced cardiomyopathy .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of dexrazoxane have been studied in advanced cancer patients with normal renal and hepatic function .
The pharmacokinetics of dexrazoxane can be adequatelydescribed by a two - compartment open model with first - order elimination .
Dexrazoxane has been administered as a 15 minute infusion over a dose range of 60 to 900 mg / m2 with 60 mg / m2 of doxorubicin , and at a fixed dose of 500 mg / m2 with 50 mg / m2 doxorubicin .
The disposition kinetics of dexrazoxane are dose - independent , as shown by linear relationship between the area under plasma concentration - time curves and administered doses ranging from 60 to 900 mg / m2 .
The mean peak plasma concentration of dexrazoxane was 36 . 5 μg / mL at 15 - minute after intravenous administration of 500 mg / m2 dose of Dexrazoxane for Injection over 15 to 30 minutes prior to the 50 mg / m2 doxorubicin dose .
The important pharmacokinetic parameters of dexrazoxane are summarized in Table 2 : Table 2 : SUMMARY OF MEAN ( % CVa ) DEXRAZOXANE PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS AT A DOSAGE RATIO OF 10 : 1 OF DEXRAZOXANE FOR INJECTION : DOXORUBICIN Dose Doxirubicin ( mg / m2 ) Dose Dexrazoxane for Injection ( mg / m2 ) Number of Subjects Elimination Half - Life ( h ) Plasma Clearence ( L / h / m2 ) Renal Clearence ( L / h / m2 ) bVolume of Distribution ( L / m2 ) 50 60 500 600 10 5 2 . 5 ( 16 ) 2 . 1 ( 29 ) 7 . 88 ( 18 ) 6 . 25 ( 31 ) 3 . 35 ( 36 ) ------- 22 . 4 ( 22 ) 22 . 0 ( 55 ) a Coefficient of variation b Steady - state volume of distribution Distribution Following a rapid distributive phase ( 0 . 2 to 0 . 3 hours ) , dexrazoxane reaches post - distributive equilibrium within two to four hours .
The estimated mean steady - state volume of distribution of dexrazoxane is 22 . 4 L / m2 after 500 mg / m2 of Dexrazoxane for Injection dose followed by 50 mg / m2 of doxorubicin , suggesting distribution throughout total body water ( 25 L / m2 ) .
In vitro studies have shown that dexrazoxane is not bound to plasma proteins .
Metabolism Qualitative metabolism studies with dexrazoxane have confirmed the presence of unchanged drug , a diacid - diamide cleavage product , and two monoacid - monoamide ring products in the urine of animals and man .
The metabolite levels were not measured in the pharmacokinetic studies .
Excretion Urinary excretion plays an important role in the elimination of dexrazoxane .
Forty - two percent of a 500 mg / m2 dose of Dexrazoxane for Injection was excreted in the urine .
Renal clearance averages 3 . 35 L / h / m2 after the 500 mg / m2 Dexrazoxane for Injection dose followed by 50 mg / m2 of doxorubicin .
Specific Populations Pediatric Pharmacokinetics following Dexrazoxane for Injection administration have not been evaluated in pediatric patients .
Effect of Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of dexrazoxane were assessed following a single 15 - minute IV infusion of 150 mg / m2 of Dexrazoxane for Injection .
Dexrazoxane clearance was reduced in subjects with renal dysfunction .
Compared with controls , the mean AUC0 - inf value was two - fold greater in subjects with moderate ( CLCR 30 - 50 mL / min ) to severe ( CLCR < 30 mL / min ) renal dysfunction .
Modeling demonstrated that equivalent exposure ( AUC0 - inf ) could be achieved if dosing were reduced by 50 % in subjects with creatinine clearance values < 40 mL / min compared with control subjects ( CLCR > 80 mL / min ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Effect of Hepatic Impairment Pharmacokinetics following Dexrazoxane for Injection administration have not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment .
The Dexrazoxane for Injection dose is dependent upon the dose of doxorubicin [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Drug Interactions There was no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin ( 50 mg / m2 ) and its predominant metabolite , doxorubicinol , in the presence of dexrazoxane ( 500 mg / m2 ) in a crossover study in cancer patients .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility No long - term carcinogenicity studies have been carried out with dexrazoxane in animals .
Nevertheless , a study by the National Cancer Institute has reported that long - term dosing with razoxane ( the racemic mixture of dexrazoxane , ICRF - 187 , and its enantiomer ICRF - 186 ) is associated with the development of malignancies in rats and possibly in mice [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Dexrazoxane was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) test , but was found to be clastogenic to human lymphocytes in vitro and to mouse bone marrow erythrocytes in vivo ( micronucleus test ) .
Dexrazoxane for Injection has the potential to impair fertility in male patients based on effects in repeat - dose toxicology studies .
Testicular atrophy was seen with dexrazoxane administration at doses as low as 30 mg / kg weekly for 6 weeks in rats ( 1 / 3 the human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) and as low as 20 mg / kg weekly for 13 weeks in dogs ( approximately equal to the human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The ability of Dexrazoxane for Injection to prevent / reduce the incidence and severity of doxorubicin - induced cardiomyopathy was evaluated in three prospectively randomized placebo - controlled studies .
In these studies , patients were treated with a doxorubicin - containing regimen and either Dexrazoxane for Injection or placebo starting with the first course of chemotherapy .
There was no restriction on the cumulative dose of doxorubicin .
Cardiac function was assessed by measurement of the LVEF , utilizing resting multigated nuclear medicine ( MUGA ) scans , and by clinical evaluations .
Patients receiving Dexrazoxane for Injection had significantly smaller mean decreases from baseline in LVEF and lower incidences of congestive heart failure than the control group ; however , in the largest study , patients with advanced breast cancer receiving FAC with Dexrazoxane for Injection had a lower response rate ( 48 % vs . 63 % ) and a shorter time to progression than patients who received FAC versus placebo .
In the clinical trials , patients who were initially randomized to receive placebo were allowed to receive Dexrazoxane for Injection after a cumulative dose of doxorubicin above 300 mg / m2 .
Retrospective historical analyses showed that the risk of experiencing a cardiac event ( see Table 3 for definition ) at a cumulative dose of doxorubicin above 300 mg / m2 was greater in the patients who did not receive Dexrazoxane for Injection beginning with their seventh course of FAC than in the patients who did receive Dexrazoxane for Injection ( HR = 13 . 08 ; 95 % CI : 3 . 72 , 46 . 03 ; p < 0 . 001 ) .
Overall , 3 % of patients treated with Dexrazoxane for Injection developed CHF compared with 22 % of patients not receiving Dexrazoxane for Injection .
