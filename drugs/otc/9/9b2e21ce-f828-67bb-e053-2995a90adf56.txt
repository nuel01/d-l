Filtration can begin at room temperature up to 8 hours , or 1 — 6 ° C up to 24 hours post - collection .
Filtration must begin within 24 hours of collection .
If preparing a platelet concentrate , the platelet - rich plasma should be separated from the red blood cells within 8 hours after collection .
If preparing fresh frozen plasma , separate from the red cells and place in the freezer at - 18 ° C or colder within 8 hours after blood collection .
For systems with in - line breakaway closure ( BAC ) , use oval style centrifuge cups .
Increased ( mechanical ) hemolysis has been associated with stripping when blood is cold and has a higher hematocrit .

Blood Processing and Filtration Instructions 1 .
Load unit into centrifuge cup [ for systems with in - line breakaway closure ( BAC ) , use oval style centrifuge cups ] , ensuring that the tubing stays in the top half of the cup .
Position the platelet ( smaller ) filter on top of the tubing assembled inside the cup .
Place the red blood cell ( larger ) filter in a horizontal position on top of the entire assembly and secure with tape or Leukotrap Strap .
If using centrifuge cups with filter adapters , follow manufacturer ' s instructions for use .
2 .
Centrifuge unit per standard protocol .
3 .
Carefully remove the unit from the centrifuge and place the collection bag in the plasma expressor .
4 .
Gently apply expressor pressure .
5 .
Place platelet ( smaller ) filter on work surface or in Pall ® PL holder ensuring that the side labeled " OUT " faces up .
Clamp tubing between the red blood cell ( larger ) filter and the Y connector .
6 .
Clamp tubing to extra satellite bag .
7 .
Open snap - open closure of the collection bag and express platelet - rich plasma into a satellite bag .
8 .
When the outlet side of the platelet filter turns pink , or red blood cells are visible in the tubing between the filter outlet and the Y connector closest to the satellite bags , clamp tubing between the filter and the Y connector closest to the satellite bags .
Release expressor pressure .
Notes : • Do not apply extra pressure to increase flow rate .
• The ATS - LPL filter will not prevent red blood cells from passing into the satellite bag during expression .
9 .
Seal tubing between platelet filter and the Y connector closest to the satellite bags .
* Detach and set aside the platelet - rich plasma for further processing .
* 10 .
Seal tubing between platelet filter and the remaining Y connector .
* Detach and discard the platelet filter and tubing .
* 11 .
Hang the AS - 3 red blood cell bag in a manner ensuring the filter is in a vertical position .
Remove clamp near red blood cell filter .
Open snap - open closure of the bag containing Nutricel AS - 3 additive solution , and transfer additive solution to the collection bag .
Note : Nutricel AS - 3 solution should be added to the collection bag immediately after platelet - rich plasma removal .
12 .
Transfer AS - 3 solution under one of the following conditions : A . Within 8 hours of collection if whole blood is held at room temperature .
B . Within 24 hours of collection if whole blood is refrigerated .
13 .
Clamp tubing close to the collection bag in order to avoid the introduction of air into the filter .
14 .
Mix red blood cells gently and thoroughly .
15 .
Hang the collection bag at one of the following heights , while ensuring that the filter is hanging in the vertical position : A . No more than 60 inches for blood stored and filtered at room temperature .
B . No more than 76 inches for blood stored and filtered at 1 — 6 ° C . 16 .
Remove clamp to allow red blood cells to gravity flow through the filter and into the red cell storage bag .
Notes : • Do not apply mechanical or manual pressure to increase flow rate .
• If unit has not completely filtered by 8 hours post - collection at room temperature , filtration must be completed at 1 — 6 ° C . • Filtration at maximum head height may shorten filtration times .
• Filtration of red cells can be unattended .
• Filtration times can be influenced by collection and processing conditions and biological variability of donors .
Experimental data with some filter products indicate that a prolonged filtration can be an indication of sub - optimal leukocyte reduction .
17 .
Clamp tubing near red cell storage bag and seal tubing below the filter .
* The numbered tubing downstream of the filter will not drain .
Notes : • If the filter housing ( downstream side ) and numbered tubing below the filter have drained ( emptied ) after filtration , it is recommended to perform QC on the unit .
• Do not strip tubing prior to sealing the tubing below the filter .
If it is desired to strip blood from numbered tubing , do so only after tubing has been sealed close to the filter and detached .
• If it is necessary to strip blood from numbered tubing for re - suspension , care should be taken when stripping is performed .
Increased ( mechanical ) hemolysis has been associated with stripping when blood is cold and has a higher hematocrit .
Do not strip forcefully or frequently against a snap - open closure .
18 .
Detach and discard collection bag and filter .
* 19 .
If desired , seal at or adjacent to " X " marks on tubing to provide numbered segments of anticoagulated blood for typing or cross matching .
* If quality control is to be performed on post - filtration sample , use the attached QC line on the bag containing red cells .
20 .
Store CP2D / AS - 3 preserved red blood cells at 1 — 6 ° C for up to 42 days and use as indicated .
