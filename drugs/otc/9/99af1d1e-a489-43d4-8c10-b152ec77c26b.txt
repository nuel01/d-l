FOR ALL GENERAL IRRIGATION , WASHING , RINSING AND DILUTION PURPOSES For Irrigation Only Not For Injection By Usual Parenteral Routes Flexible Irrigation Container Semi - rigid Irrigation Container Rx only DESCRIPTION Sterile Water for Irrigation , USP is a sterile , distilled , nonpyrogenic water for injection intended only for sterile irrigation , washing , rinsing and dilution purposes .
pH 5 . 5 ( 5 . 0 to 7 . 0 ) .
Sterile Water for Irrigation , USP contains no bacteriostat , antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended for use only as a single - dose or short procedure irrigation .
When smaller volumes are required the unused portion should be discarded .
Sterile Water for Irrigation , USP may be classified as a sterile irrigant , wash , rinse , diluent and pharmaceutical vehicle .
Water for Irrigation , USP is chemically designated H2O .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
The semi - rigid container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyolefin .
It is a copolymer of ethylene and propylene .
The container requires no vapor barrier to maintain the proper drug concentration .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts ; however , biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sterile Water for Irrigation , USP exerts a mechanical cleansing action for sterile irrigation of body cavities , tissues or wounds , indwelling urethral catheters and surgical drainage tubes , and for washing , rinsing or soaking surgical dressings , instruments and laboratory specimens .
It also serves as a diluent or vehicle for drugs used for irrigation or other pharmaceutical preparations .
Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms .
Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium ( Na + ) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sterile Water for Irrigation , USP is indicated for all general irrigation , washing , rinsing and dilution purposes which permit use of sterile , nonpyrogenic , solute - free water .
CONTRAINDICATIONS NOT FOR INJECTION BY USUAL PARENTERAL ROUTES .
WARNINGS FOR IRRIGATION ONLY .
This preparation is solute - free and its entry into the circulation will cause hemolysis .
Solutions for urologic irrigation must be used with caution in patients with severe cardiopulmonary or renal dysfunction .
Irrigating fluids used during transurethral prostatectomy have been demonstrated to enter the systemic circulation in relatively large volumes , thus , Sterile Water for Irrigation , USP must be regarded as a systemic drug .
Absorption of large amounts of Sterile Water for Irrigation , USP with or without additives can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered solutions .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of such solutions .
Do not heat container over 66 ° C ( 150 ° F ) .
PRECAUTIONS Do not use for irrigation that may result in absorption into the blood .
Caution should be observed when solute - free water is used for continuous irrigation or allowed to " dwell " inside body cavities because of possible absorption into the blood stream and the production of intravascular hemolysis and circulatory overload .
Aseptic technique is essential with the use of sterile preparations for irrigation of body cavities , wounds and urethral catheters or for wetting dressings that come in contact with body tissues .
When used as a " pour " irrigation , no part of the contents should be allowed to contact the surface below the outer protected thread area of the semi - rigid wide mouth container .
The flexible container is designed for use with nonvented irrigation sets .
When used for irrigation via appropriate irrigation equipment , the administration set should be attached promptly .
Unused portions should be discarded and a fresh container of appropriate size used for the start up of each cycle or repeat procedure .
For repeated irrigations of urethral catheters , a separate container should be used for each patient .
Do not administer unless water is clear , seal is intact and container is undamaged .
Discard unused portion .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Studies with Sterile Water for Irrigation , USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential , or effects on fertility .
Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when Sterile Water for Irrigation , USP is administered to a nursing woman .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects .
Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sterile Water for Irrigation , USP .
It is also not known whether Sterile Water for Irrigation , USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Sterile Water for Irrigation , USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Possible adverse effects arising from the irrigation of body cavities , tissues , or indwelling catheters and tubes are completely avoidable when proper procedures are followed .
Displaced catheters or drainage tubes can lead to irrigation or infiltration of unintended structures or cavities .
Excessive volume or pressure during irrigation of closed cavities may cause undue distention or disruption of tissues .
Accidental contamination from careless technique may transmit infection .
Should any adverse reaction occur , discontinue the irrigant , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination , if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of overhydration or solute overload ( if solutes have been added to the irrigation ) , re - evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures .
( See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS . )
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose is dependent upon the capacity or surface area of the structure to be irrigated and the nature of the procedure .
When used as a diluent or vehicle for drugs , the manufacturer ' s recommendations should be followed .
Drug Interactions Additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist , if available .
When introducing additives , use aseptic technique , mix thoroughly and do not store .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution container permits .
( See PRECAUTIONS . )
