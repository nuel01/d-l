CALCIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION , USP , 10 % 13 . 6 mEq ( 1 g ) per 10 mL 100 mg ( 1 . 36 mEq ) / mL Osmolarity approximately 2050 mOsmol / L DESCRIPTION Calcium Chloride Injection , USP , 10 % , is a sterile aqueous solution containing , in each mL , 100 mg ( 1 . 36 mEq ) calcium chloride .
The pH of the solution may have been adjusted with hydrochloric acid and / or calcium hydroxide , when necessary .
The air above the liquid in the individual containers has been displaced by flushing with nitrogen during the filling operation .
The preparation contains no antimicrobial preservatives and is intended as a single - dose vial ; once the unit is assembled and used , any remaining portion of the solution must be discarded with the entire unit .
Calcium Chloride , USP , contains two molecules of water of hydration and is chemically designated as CaCl 2 • 2 H 20 .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the body , the major fraction of which is found in the bony structure .
Calcium plays important physiological roles ; it is essential for the functional integrity of the nervous and muscular systems ; it is necessary for normal cardiac function ; and it is one of the factors involved in the mechanism of blood coagulation .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Calcium Chloride Injection , USP , 10 % is indicated : In the treatment of hypocalcemia in conditions requiring a prompt increase in plasma calcium levels ( e . g . , neonatal tetany and tetany due to parathyroid deficiency , vitamin D deficiency and alkalosis ) and for prevention of hypocalcemia during exchange transfusions .
As adjunctive therapy in the management of acute symptoms in lead colic .
In the treatment of magnesium intoxication due to overdosage of magnesium sulfate .
In severe hyperkalemia , to combat deleterious effects on electrocardiographic ( ECG ) function , pending correction of the potassium level in the extracellular fluid .
In cardiac resuscitation , particularly after open heart surgery , when epinephrine fails to improve weak or ineffective myocardial contractions .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Calcium chloride is contraindicated for cardiac resuscitation in the presence of ventricular fibrillation .
WARNINGS Calcium chloride should be injected into a large vein very slowly , as it may cause peripheral vasodilatation and a cutaneous burning sensation .
A moderate fall in blood pressure due to vasodilatation may attend the injection .
Since calcium chloride is an acidifying salt , it is usually undesirable in the treatment of hypocalcemia or renal insufficiency .
PRECAUTIONS General Calcium Chloride Injection , USP , 10 % is irritating to veins and must not be injected into tissues , since severe necrosis and sloughing may occur .
Great care should be taken to avoid extravasation or accidental injection into perivascular tissues .
Solutions should be warmed to body temperature .
Injections should be made slowly through a small needle into a large vein to minimize venous irritation and avoid undesirable reactions .
It is particularly important to prevent a high concentration of calcium from reaching the heart because of the danger of cardiac syncope .
If injected into the ventricular cavity in cardiac resuscitation care must be taken to avoid injection into the myocardial tissue .
Drug Interactions Because of the danger involved in the simultaneous use of calcium salts and drugs of the digitalis group , a digitalized patient should not receive an intravenous injection of a calcium compound unless the indications are clearly defined .
Calcium salts should not generally be mixed with carbonates , phosphates , sulfates or tartrates in parenteral admixtures .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Rapid I . V . injection may cause the patient to complain of tingling sensations , a calcium taste , a sense of oppression or “ heat wave . ”
Injections of calcium chloride are accompanied by peripheral vasodilation as well as a local “ burning ” sensation , and there may be a moderate fall in blood pressure .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION FOR INTRACARDIAC OR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY INJECT SLOWLY Calcium Chloride Injection , USP , 10 % , is administered only by slow intravenous injection ( not to exceed 1 mL / min ) and / or in cardiac resuscitation , by injection into the ventricular cavity .
It must not be injected into the myocardium .
The usual precautions for intravenous therapy should be observed .
If time permits , the solution should be warmed to body temperature .
The injection should be halted if the patient complains of any discomfort ; it may be resumed when symptoms disappear .
Following injection , the patient should remain recumbent for a short time .
INTRACARDIAC USE For cardiac resuscitation , inject into the ventricular cavity , not into the heart muscle .
Usual Adult Dosage : 200 to 800 mg ( 2 to 8 mL ) when injected into the ventricular cavity .
Pediatric Dosage : 0 . 2 mL / kg of body weight .
INTRAVENOUS USE Hypocalcemic Disorders Usual Adult Dosage : 500 mg to 1 g ( 5 to 10 mL ) at intervals of 1 to 3 days , depending on the response of the patient and / or results of serum calcium determinations .
Repeated injections may be required because of rapid excretion of calcium .
Pediatric Dosage : 0 . 2 mL / kg of body weight .
Maximum 1 - 10 mL / day .
Magnesium Intoxication Initial Adult Dose : 500 mg ( 5 mL ) administered promptly and the patient observed for signs of recovery before further doses are given .
Hyperkalemic ECG Disturbances of Cardiac Function Dosage should be adjusted by constant monitoring of ECG changes during administration .
