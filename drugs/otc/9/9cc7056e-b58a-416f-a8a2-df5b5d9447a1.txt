Lactic acid is a racemic mixture of 2 - hydroxypropanoic acid and has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Lactic acid is an alpha - hydroxy acid .
It is a normal constituent of tissues and blood .
The alpha - hydroxy acids ( and their salts ) are felt to act as humectants when applied to the skin .
This property may influence hydration of the stratum corneum .
In addition , lactic acid , when applied to the skin , may act to decrease corneocyte cohesion .
The mechanism ( s ) by which this is accomplished is not yet known .
An in vitro study of percutaneous absorption of ammonium lactate cream using human cadaver skin indicates that approximately 6 . 1 % of the material was absorbed after 68 hours .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ammonium Lactate Cream , 12 % is indicated for the treatment of ichthyosis vulgaris and xerosis .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Ammonium Lactate Cream , 12 % is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the label ingredients .

Use of this product should be discontinued if hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients is noted .
PRECAUTIONS General - For external use only .
Stinging or burning may occur when applied to skin with fissures , erosions , or that is otherwise abraded ( for example , after shaving the legs ) .
Caution is advised when used on the face because of the potential for irritation .
The potential for post - inflammatory hypo - or hyperpigmentation has not been studied .

Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility - The topical treatment of CD - 1 mice with 12 % , 21 % or 30 % ammonium lactate formulations for two years did not produce a significant increase in dermal or systemic tumors in the absence of increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation .
The maximum systemic exposure of the mice in this study was 0 . 7 times the maximum possible systemic exposure in humans .
However , a long - term photocarcinogenicity study in hairless albino mice suggested that topically applied 12 % ammonium lactate cream enhanced the rate of ultraviolet light - induced skin tumor formation .
The mutagenic potential of ammonium lactate cream was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the mouse in vivo micronucleus assay , both of which were negative .
In dermal Segment I and III studies with ammonium lactate cream , there were no effects observed in fertility or pre - or post - natal development parameters in rats at dose levels of 300 mg / kg / day ( 1800 mg / m2 / day ) , approximately 0 . 4 times the human topical dose .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category B - Animal reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 0 . 7 and 1 . 5 times the human dose , respectively ( 600 mg / kg / day , corresponding to 3600 mg / m2 / day in the rat and 7200 mg / m2 / day in the rabbit ) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ammonium lactate cream .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , ammonium lactate cream should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers - Although lactic acid is a normal constituent of blood and tissues , it is not known to what extent this drug affects normal lactic acid levels in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when ammonium lactate cream is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use - The safety and efficacy of Ammonium Lactate Cream , 12 % has been established in patients as young as 2 years old .
Geriatric Use - Clinical studies of ammonium lactate cream , 12 % did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious .
ADVERSE REACTIONS In controlled clinical trials of patients with ichthyosis vulgaris , the most frequent adverse reactions in patients treated with ammonium lactate cream were rash ( including erythema and irritation ) and burning / stinging .
Each was reported in approximately 10 - 15 % of patients .
In addition , itching was reported in approximately 5 % of patients .
In controlled clinical trials of patients with xerosis , the most frequent adverse reactions in patients treated with ammonium lactate cream were transient burning , in about 3 % of patients , stinging , dry skin and rash , each reported in approximately 2 % of patients .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Apply to the affected areas and rub in thoroughly .
Use twice daily or as directed by a physician .
