8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE Due to the characteristics of this preparation , no toxic effects are to be expected with an otic overdose of Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution .
11 DESCRIPTION Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution , 0 . 3 % / 0 . 025 % is a sterile , preservative - free , clear otic solution containing the fluoroquinolone antibacterial , ciprofloxacin hydrochloride , combined with the corticosteroid , fluocinolone acetonide .
Each single - dose vial contains a deliverable volume of 0 . 25 mL solution of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride equivalent to 0 . 75 mg ciprofloxacin and 0 . 0625 mg fluocinolone acetonide .
The pH of the solution ranges from 3 . 5 to 5 . 0 .
The inactive ingredients are polysorbate 80 , glycerin , povidone K90F and water for injection .
Ciprofloxacin is available as the monohydrochloride , monohydrate salt of 1 - cyclopropyl - 6 - fluoro - 1 , 4 - dihydro - 4 - oxo - 7 - ( 1 - piperazinyl ) - 3 - quinolinecarboxylic acid .
Its molecular formula is C17H18FN3O3 ∙ HCl ∙ H2O .
The chemical structure of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The chemical name of fluocinolone acetonide is ( 6α , 11β , 16α ) - 6 , 9 - difluoro - 11 , 21 - dihydroxy - 16 , 17 [ ( 1 - methylethylidene ) bis ( oxy ) ] - pregna - 1 , 4 - diene - 3 , 20 - dione , cyclic 16 , 17 acetal with acetone [ 67 - 73 - 2 ] .
Its molecular formula is C24H30F2O6 .
The chemical structure of fluocinolone acetonide is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
Fluocinolone acetonide , a corticosteroid , inhibits the local biosynthesis of prostaglandins , which explains part of its anti - inflammatory efficacy .
At the cellular level , corticosteroids induce peptides called lipocortins .
Lipocortins antagonize phospholipase A2 , an enzyme which causes the breakdown of leukocyte lysosomal membranes to release arachidonic acid .
This action decreases the subsequent formation and release of endogenous inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins , kinins , histamine , liposomal enzymes and the complement system .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In two studies in children with AOMT aged ≥ 6 months to 12 years , blood samples were taken in subgroups of 16 and 14 patients , at Visit 1 ( prior to the first dose ) and Visit 3 ( within 1 and 2 hours after the last dose ) respectively , to determine the plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin and / or fluocinolone acetonide following administration of Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution at the recommended dosage regimen of 0 . 25 mL twice daily .
Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis resulted in only 1 sample showing a detectable concentration of ciprofloxacin in plasma of 3 . 0 mcg / L after 7 days of treatment , and no detectable concentrations in plasma of fluocinolone acetonide were observed .
However , the sample with detectable ciprofloxacin concentrations was from a patient who had bilateral AOMT ( protocol deviation because all patients participating in the PK study were to have unilateral otorrhea ) and who received treatment in both ears with ciprofloxacin 0 . 3 % otic solution , the active comparator .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase , which is needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA .
Resistance Bacterial resistance to quinolones can develop through chromosomal or plasmid - mediated mechanisms .
In vitro studies demonstrated cross - resistance between ciprofloxacin and some fluoroquinolones .
There is generally no cross - resistance between ciprofloxacin and other classes of antibacterial agents such as beta - lactams or aminoglycosides .
Antimicrobial Activity Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria , both in vitro and clinically in otic infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] : Aerobic Bacteria : Gram - positive Bacteria : Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram - negative Bacteria : Pseudomonas aeruginosa Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No long term studies of Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential .
Long - term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been completed for ciprofloxacin .
After daily oral doses of 750 mg / kg ( mice ) and 250 mg / kg ( rats ) were administered for up to 2 years , there was no evidence that ciprofloxacin had any carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects in these species .
Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide .
Mutagenesis Eight in vitro mutagenicity tests have been conducted with ciprofloxacin , and the test results are listed below : • Salmonella / Microsome Test ( Negative ) • E . coli DNA Repair Assay ( Negative ) • Mouse Lymphoma Cell Forward Mutation Assay ( Positive ) • Chinese Hamster V79 Cell HGPRT Test ( Negative ) • Syrian Hamster Embryo Cell Transformation Assay ( Negative ) • Saccharomyces cerevisiae Point Mutation Assay ( Negative ) • Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mitotic Crossover and Gene Conversion Assay ( Negative ) • Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay ( Positive ) Thus , 2 of the 8 tests were positive , but results of the following 3 in vivo test systems gave negative results : • Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay • Micronucleus Test ( Mice ) • Dominant Lethal Test ( Mice ) Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide .
Some corticosteroids have been found to be genotoxic .
Impairment of Fertility No reproduction toxicity studies were conducted with Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution .
Absorption of ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide following otic administration of Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution at the recommended dosage is negligible [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two phase 3 multicenter , randomized , double - blind , active - controlled , parallel group trials were conducted in 662 pediatric patients in total ( aged 6 months to 12 years old ) with AOMT , to assess the efficacy and safety of Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution compared to ciprofloxacin otic solution and to fluocinolone acetonide otic solution ( Trial 1 and Trial 2 ) .
In both trials , the Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution treatment arms showed significantly shorter times to cessation of otorrhea in comparison to both the ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide alone arms demonstrating the contribution of both components of Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution .
The results are presented in the table below : Table 2 : Results of the Primary Endpoint : Time to Cessation of Otorrhea ( Trial 1 and Trial 2 ) Treatment arm n . e . : not estimable because the number of censored patients was greater than the number of patients with cessation of otorrhea Trial 1 Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution ( N = 112 ) CIPRO ( N = 109 ) FLUO ( N = 110 ) Number ( % ) with cessation of otorrhea by Day 22 88 ( 78 . 6 % ) 73 ( 67 . 0 % ) 53 ( 48 . 2 % ) Median time to cessation [ 1 ] ( days ) 3 . 75 7 . 69 n . e . p - value vs Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution [ 2 ] < 0 . 001 < 0 . 001 Trial 2 Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution ( N = 111 ) CIPRO ( N = 112 ) FLUO ( N = 108 ) Number ( % ) with cessation of otorrhea by Day 22 87 ( 78 . 4 % ) 77 ( 68 . 8 % ) 47 ( 43 . 5 % ) Median time to cessation null ( days ) 4 . 94 6 . 83 n . e . p - value vs Ciprofloxacin and Fluocinolone Acetonide Otic Solution null 0 . 028 < 0 . 001 [ 1 ] Kaplan - Meier median estimate censored all subjects who did not have a cessation of otorrhea at the maximum time point of 22 days .
