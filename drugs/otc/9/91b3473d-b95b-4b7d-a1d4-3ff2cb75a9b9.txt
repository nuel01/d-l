It is unknown if use of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life .
After discontinuing Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP in adolescents , mean BMD loss at total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 60 months ( 240 weeks ) post - treatment [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Similarly , in adults , there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at total hip , femoral neck and lumbar spine towards baseline by 24 months post - treatment .
[ See Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) . ]
Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP should not be used as a long - term birth control method ( i . e . , longer than 2 years ) unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate .
BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP long - term .
In adolescents , interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity .
Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk / benefit analysis for the use of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP in women with osteoporosis risk factors .
Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis ( e . g . , metabolic bone disease , chronic alcohol and / or tobacco use , anorexia nervosa , strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids ) .
Although there are no studies addressing whether calcium and Vitamin D may lessen BMD loss in women using Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP , all patients should have adequate calcium and Vitamin D intake .
5 . 2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP .

5 . 3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use hormone contraceptives , including Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP , because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive .
Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care .
A pooled analysis from two case - control studies , the World Health Organization Study and the New Zealand Study , reported the relative risk ( RR ) of breast cancer for women who had ever used Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP as 1 . 1 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0 . 97 to 1 . 4 ) .
Overall , there was no increase in risk with increasing duration of use of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP .
The RR of breast cancer for women of all ages who had initiated use of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP within the previous 5 years was estimated to be 2 . 0 ( 95 % CI 1 . 5 to 2 . 8 ) .
The World Health Organization Study , a component of the pooled analysis described above , showed an increased RR of 2 . 19 ( 95 % CI 1 . 23 to 3 . 89 ) of breast cancer associated with use of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP in women whose first exposure to drug was within the previous 4 years and who were under 35 years of age .
However , the overall RR for ever - users of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP was 1 . 2 ( 95 % CI 0 . 96 to 1 . 52 ) .
The National Cancer Institute reports an average annual incidence rate for breast cancer for US women , all races , age 15 to 34 years of 8 . 7 per 100 , 000 .
A RR of 2 . 19 , thus , increases the possible risk from 8 . 7 to 19 . 0 cases per 100 , 000 women .
The attributable risk , thus , is 31 . 8 per 100 , 000 women per year .
Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in RR estimates of invasive squamous - cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years ( RR 1 . 22 to 1 . 28 and 95 % CI 0 . 93 to 1 . 70 ) .
The overall , nonsignificant relative rate of invasive squamous - cell cervical cancer in women who ever used Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP was estimated to be 1 . 11 ( 95 % CI 0 . 96 to 1 . 29 ) .
No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed .

11 DESCRIPTION Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP contains medroxyprogesterone acetate , a derivative of progesterone , as its active ingredient .
Medroxyprogesterone acetate is active by the parenteral and oral routes of administration .
It is a white to off - white ; odorless crystalline powder that is stable in air and that melts between 200 ° C and 210 ° C .
It is freely soluble in chloroform , soluble in acetone and dioxane , sparingly soluble in alcohol and methanol , slightly soluble in ether , and insoluble in water .
The chemical name for Medroxyprogesterone Acetate is pregn - 4 - ene - 3 , 20 - dione , 17 - ( acetyloxy ) - 6 - methyl - , ( 6α - ) .
The structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP for intramuscular ( IM ) injection is available in vials and prefilled syringes , each containing 1 mL of medroxyprogesterone acetate sterile aqueous suspension 150 mg / mL .
Each mL contains : Medroxyprogesterone acetate 150 mg Polyethylene glycol 3350 28 . 9 mg Polysorbate 80 2 . 41 mg Sodium chloride 8 . 68 mg Methylparaben 1 . 37 mg Propylparaben 0 . 150 mg Water for injection quantity sufficient When necessary , pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid , or both .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP , when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months , inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which , in turn , prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrial thinning .
These actions produce its contraceptive effect .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 150 mg IM dose of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP in eight women between the ages of 28 and 36 years old , medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations , measured by an extracted radioimmunoassay procedure , increase for approximately 3 weeks to reach peak plasma concentrations of 1 to 7 ng / mL .
Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86 % .
MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin .
No binding of MPA occurs with sex - hormone - binding globulin ( SHBG ) .
Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes .
Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and / or side - chain reduction , loss of the acetyl group , hydroxylation in the 2 - , 6 - , and 21 - positions or a combination of these positions , resulting in more than 10 metabolites .
Excretion The concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate decrease exponentially until they become undetectable ( < 100 pg / mL ) between 120 to 200 days following injection .
Using an unextracted radioimmunoassay procedure for the assay of medroxyprogesterone acetate in serum , the apparent half - life for medroxyprogesterone acetate following IM administration of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP is approximately 50 days .
Most medroxyprogesterone acetate metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only minor amounts excreted as sulfates .
Specific Populations The effect of hepatic and / or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP is unknown .

14 . 3 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent Females ( 12 – 18 years of age ) The impact of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP ( 150 mg ) use for up to 240 weeks ( 4 . 6 years ) was evaluated in an open - label non - randomized clinical study in 389 adolescent females ( 12 – 18 years ) .
Use of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD .
Partway through the trial , drug administration was stopped ( at 120 weeks ) .
The mean number of injections per Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP user was 9 . 3 .
The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use ( see Table 5 ) .
The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip ( - 6 . 4 % ) and femoral neck ( - 5 . 4 % ) compared to lumbar spine ( - 2 . 1 % ) .
In general , adolescents increase bone density during the period of growth following menarche , as seen in the untreated cohort .
However , the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age , gynecologic age , race , BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of bone mineral density .

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post - treatment for adolescent women who received Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP for two years or less compared to more than two years .
Post - treatment follow - up showed that , in women treated for more than two years , only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued .
Subjects treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post - treatment .
Adolescent women in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period ( data not shown ) .

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP .
The Incident Rate Ratio ( IRR ) for any fracture during the follow - up period ( mean = 5 . 5 years ) was 1 . 41 ( 95 % CI 1 . 35 , 1 . 47 ) .
It is not known if this is due to Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate .
In the study , when cumulative exposure to Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP was calculated , the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections .
However , it is not clear that cumulative exposure , which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non - use , is a useful measure of risk , as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use .
There were very few osteoporotic fractures ( fracture sites known to be related to low BMD ) in the study overall , and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP users compared to non - users .
Importantly , this study could not determine whether use of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injectable Suspension , USP has an effect on fracture rate later in life .
