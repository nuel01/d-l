6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
A double - blind , controlled clinical trial in 1 , 955 evaluable women compared the efficacy and safety of levonorgestrel tablets ( one 0 . 75 mg tablet of levonorgestrel taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse , and one tablet taken 12 hours later ) to the Yuzpe regimen ( two tablets each containing 0 . 25 mg levonorgestrel and 0 . 05 mg ethinyl estradiol , taken within 72 hours of intercourse , and two tablets taken 12 hours later ) .
The most common adverse events ( > 10 % ) in the clinical trial for women receiving levonorgestrel tablets included menstrual changes ( 26 % ) , nausea ( 23 % ) , abdominal pain ( 18 % ) , fatigue ( 17 % ) , headache ( 17 % ) , dizziness ( 11 % ) , and breast tenderness ( 11 % ) .

Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of progestin - only pills include : • barbiturates • bosentan • carbamazepine • felbamate • griseofulvin • oxcarbazepine • phenytoin • rifampin • St . John ’ s wort • topiramate Significant changes ( increase or decrease ) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of coadministration with HIV protease inhibitors or with non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors .
Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with progestin - only pills or the potential for enzyme alterations .
Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes , such as CYP3A4 , may decrease the effectiveness of progestin - only pills .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Nursing Mothers : Small amounts of progestin pass into the breast milk of nursing women taking progestin - only pills for long - term contraception , resulting in detectable steroid levels in infant plasma .
( 8 . 3 ) • Next ChoiceTM is not intended for use in premenarcheal ( 8 . 4 ) or postmenopausal females ( 8 . 5 ) .
• Clinical trials demonstrated a higher pregnancy rate in the Chinese population .
( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Many studies have found no harmful effects on fetal development associated with longterm use of contraceptive doses of oral progestins .
The few studies of infant growth and development that have been conducted with progestin - only pills have not demonstrated significant adverse effects .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers In general , no adverse effects of progestin - only pills have been found on breastfeeding performance or on the health , growth or development of the infant .
However , isolated post - marketing cases of decreased milk production have been reported .
Small amounts of progestins pass into the breast milk of nursing mothers taking progestin - only pills for long - term contraception , resulting in detectable steroid levels in infant plasma .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of progestin - only pills for long - term contraception have been established in women of reproductive age .
Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents less than 17 years and for users 17 years and older .
Use of Next ChoiceTM emergency contraception before menarche is not indicated .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use This product is not intended for use in postmenopausal women .
8 . 6 Race No formal studies have evaluated the effect of race .
However , clinical trials demonstrated a higher pregnancy rate in Chinese women with both levonorgestrel tablets and the Yuzpe regimen ( another form of emergency contraception ) .
The reason for this apparent increase in the pregnancy rate with emergency contraceptives in Chinese women is unknown .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No formal studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of levonorgestrel tablets .
8 . 8 Renal Impairment No formal studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal disease on the disposition of levonorgestrel tablets .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Levonorgestrel is not a controlled substance .
There is no information about dependence associated with the use of Next ChoiceTM .
10 OVERDOSAGE There are no data on overdosage of levonorgestrel tablets , although the common adverse event of nausea and associated vomiting may be anticipated .
11 DESCRIPTION Each Next ChoiceTM tablet contains 0 . 75 mg of a single active steroid ingredient , levonorgestrel [ 18 , 19 - Dinorpregn - 4 - en - 20 - yn - 3 - one - 13 - ethyl - 1 7 - hydroxy - , ( 17α ) - ( - ) - ] , a totally synthetic progestogen .
The inactive ingredients present are colloidal silicon dioxide , corn starch , FD & C Yellow # 6 , magnesium stearate , povidone , and lactose monohydrate .
Levonorgestrel has a molecular weight of 312 . 45 , and the following structural and molecular formulas : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Emergency contraceptive pills are not effective if a woman is already pregnant .
Next ChoiceTM is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization ( by altering tubal transport of sperm and / or ova ) .
In addition , they may inhibit implantation ( by altering the endometrium ) .
It is not effective once the process of implantation has begun .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption No specific investigation of the absolute bioavailability of levonorgestrel tablets in humans has been conducted .
However , literature indicates that levonorgestrel is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration ( bioavailability about 100 % ) and is not subject to first pass metabolism .
After a single dose of levonorgestrel tablets ( 0 . 75 mg ) administered to 16 women under fasting conditions , the mean maximum serum concentration of levonorgestrel was 14 . 1 ng / mL at an average of 1 . 6 hours .
See Table 2 .
Table 2 : Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values Following Single Dose Administration of Levonorgestrel Tablets 0 . 75 mg to Healthy Female Volunteers under Fasting Conditions Mean ( ± SD ) Cmax Tmax CL Vd t1 / 2 AUCinf ( ng / mL ) ( h ) ( L / h ) ( L ) ( h ) ( ng · hr / mL ) Levonorgestrel 14 . 1 ( 7 . 7 ) 1 . 6 ( 0 . 7 ) 7 . 7 ( 2 . 7 ) 260 . 0 24 . 4 ( 5 . 3 ) 123 . 1 ( 50 . 1 ) Cmax = maximum concentration Tmax = time to maximum concentration CL = clearance Vd = volume of distribution t1 / 2 = elimination half life AUCinf = area under the drug concentration curve from time 0 to infinity Effect of Food : The effect of food on the rate and the extent of levonorgestrel absorption following single oral administration of levonorgestrel has not been evaluated .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of levonorgestrel is reported to be approximately 1 . 8 L / kg .
It is about 97 . 5 to 99 % protein - bound , principally to sex hormone binding globulin ( SHBG ) and , to a lesser extent , serum albumin .
Metabolism Following absorption , levonorgestrel is conjugated at the 17β - OH position to form sulfate conjugates and , to a lesser extent , glucuronide conjugates in plasma .
Significant amounts of conjugated and unconjugated 3α , 5β - tetrahydrolevonorgestrel are also present in plasma , along with much smaller amounts of 3α , 5α - tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16βhydroxylevonorgestrel .
Levonorgestrel and its phase I metabolites are excreted primarily as glucuronide conjugates .
Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several - fold , and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users .
Excretion About 45 % of levonorgestrel and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and about 32 % are excreted in feces , mostly as glucuronide conjugates .
Specific Populations Pediatric : This product is not intended for use in the premenarcheal population , and pharmacokinetic data are not available for this population .
Geriatric : This product is not intended for use in postmenopausal women and pharmacokinetic data are not available for this population .
Race : No formal studies have evaluated the effect of race on pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel tablets .
However , clinical trials demonstrated a higher pregnancy rate in Chinese women with both levonorgestrel tablets and the Yuzpe regimen ( another form of emergency contraception ) .
The reason for this apparent increase in the pregnancy rate with emergency contraceptives in Chinese women is unknown [ see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment : No formal studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of levonorgestrel tablets .
Renal Impairment : No formal studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal disease on the disposition of levonorgestrel tablets .
Drug - Drug Interactions No formal drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with levonorgestrel tablets [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity : There is no evidence of increased risk of cancer with short - term use of progestins .
There was no increase in tumorgenicity following administration of levonorgestrel to rats for 2 years at approximately 5 μg / day , to dogs for 7 years at up to 0 . 125 mg / kg / day , or to rhesus monkeys for 10 years at up to 250 μg / kg / day .
In another 7 year dog study , administration of levonorgestrel at 0 . 5 mg / kg / day did increase the number of mammary adenomas in treated dogs compared to controls .
There were no malignancies .
Genotoxicity : Levonorgestrel was not found to be mutagenic or genotoxic in the Ames Assay , in vitromammalian culture assays utilizing mouse lymphoma cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells , and in an in vivomicronucleus assay in mice .
Fertility : There are no irreversible effects on fertility following cessation of exposures to levonorgestrel or progestins in general .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES A double - blind , randomized , multinational controlled clinical trial in 1 , 955 evaluable women ( mean age 27 ) compared the efficacy and safety of levonorgestrel tablets ( one 0 . 75 mg tablet of levonorgestrel taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse , and one tablet taken 12 hours later ) to the Yuzpe regimen ( two tablets each containing 0 . 25 mg levonorgestrel and 0 . 05 mg ethinyl estradiol , taken within 72 hours of intercourse , and two additional tablets taken 12 hours later ) .
After a single act of intercourse occurring anytime during the menstrual cycle , the expected pregnancy rate of 8 % ( with no contraceptive use ) was reduced to approximately 1 % with levonorgestrel tablets .
Emergency contraceptives are not as effective as routine hormonal contraception since their failure rate , while low based on a single use , would accumulate over time with repeated use [ see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ( 1 ) ] .
At the time of expected menses , approximately 74 % of women using levonorgestrel tablets had vaginal bleeding similar to their normal menses , 14 % bled more than usual , and 12 % bled less than usual .
The majority of women ( 87 % ) had their next menstrual period at the expected time or within + 7 days , while 13 % had a delay of more than 7 days beyond the anticipated onset of menses .
16 HOW SUPPLIED / STORAGE AND HANDLING Next ChoiceTM ( levonorgestrel ) tablets , 0 . 75 mg , are available for a single course of treatment in PVC / aluminum foil blister packages of two tablets each .
