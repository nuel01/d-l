Based on available data , it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs .
The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease .
However , patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events , due to their increased baseline rate .
Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment .
The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses .
To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID - treated patients , use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible .
Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events , throughout the entire treatment course , even in the absence of previous CV symptoms .
Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur .
There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use .
The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID , such as diclofenac , increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal ( GI ) events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) Surgery Two large , controlled clinical trials of a COX - 2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 – 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke .
NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Post - MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post - MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction , CV - related death , and all - cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment .
In this same cohort , the incidence of death in the first year post - MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID - treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non - NSAID exposed patients .
Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post - MI , the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow - up .
Avoid the use of FLECTOR PATCH in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events .
If FLECTOR PATCH is used in patients with a recent MI , monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia .
5 . 2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding , Ulceration , and Perforation NSAIDs , including diclofenac , cause serious gastrointestinal ( GI ) adverse events including inflammation , bleeding , ulceration , and perforation of the esophagus , stomach , small intestine , or large intestine , which can be fatal .
These serious adverse events can occur at any time , with or without warning symptoms , in patients treated with NSAIDs .
Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic .
Upper GI ulcers , gross bleeding , or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1 % of patients treated for 3 - 6 months , and in about 2 % - 4 % of patients treated for one year .
However , even short - term NSAID therapy is not without risk .
Risk Factors for GI Bleeding , Ulceration , and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and / or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10 - fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors .
Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy ; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids , aspirin , anticoagulants , or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) ; smoking ; use of alcohol ; older age ; and poor general health status .
Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients .
Additionally , patients with advanced liver disease and / or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding .
Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID - treated patients : • Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration .
• Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time .
• Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding .
For such patients , as well as those with active GI bleeding , consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs .
• Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy .
• If a serious GI adverse event is suspected , promptly initiate evaluation and treatment , and discontinue FLECTOR PATCH until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out .
• In the setting of concomitant use of low - dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis , monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials of oral diclofenac containing products , meaningful elevations ( i . e . , more than 3 times the ULN ) of AST ( SGOT ) were observed in about 2 % of approximately 5 , 700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment ( ALT was not measured in all studies ) .
In a large open - label , controlled trial of 3 , 700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 - 6 months , patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1 , 200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks .
Meaningful elevations of ALT and / or AST occurred in about 4 % of the 3 , 700 patients and included marked elevations ( greater than 8 times the ULN ) in about 1 % of the 3 , 700 patients .
In that open - label study , a higher incidence of borderline ( less than 3 times the ULN ) , moderate ( 3 - 8 times the ULN ) , and marked ( greater than 8 times the ULN ) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs .
Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis .
Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic .
Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations .
In postmarketing reports , cases of drug - induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month , and in some cases , the first 2 months of therapy , but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac .
Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions , including liver necrosis , jaundice , fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice , and liver failure .
Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation .
In a European retrospective population - based , case - controlled study , 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug - induced liver injury with current use compared with non - use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4 - fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury .
In this particular study , based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac , the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender , doses of 150 mg or more , and duration of use for more than 90 days .
Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long - term therapy with diclofenac , because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms .
The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known .
Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences , transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac .
However , severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac .
If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen , if clinical signs and / or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop , or if systemic manifestations occur ( e . g . , eosinophilia , rash , abdominal pain , diarrhea , dark urine , etc . ) , FLECTOR PATCH should be discontinued immediately .
Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity ( e . g . , nausea , fatigue , lethargy , diarrhea , pruritus , jaundice , right upper quadrant tenderness , and " flu - like " symptoms ) .
If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop , or if systemic manifestations occur ( e . g . , eosinophilia , rash , etc . ) , discontinue FLECTOR PATCH immediately , and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient .
To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with FLECTOR PATCH , use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible .
Exercise caution when prescribing FLECTOR PATCH with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic ( e . g . , acetaminophen , antibiotics , anti - epileptics ) .
5 . 4 Hypertension NSAIDs , including FLECTOR PATCH , can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension , either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events .
Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , thiazide diuretics , or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Monitor blood pressure ( BP ) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy .
5 . 5 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists ' Collaboration meta - analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two - fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX - 2 selective - treated patients and nonselective NSAID - treated patients compared to placebo - treated patients .
In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure , NSAID use increased the risk of MI , hospitalization for heart failure , and death .
Additionally , fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs .
Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions ( e . g . , diuretics , ACE inhibitors , or angiotensin receptor blockers [ ARBs ] ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Avoid the use of FLECTOR PATCH in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure .
If FLECTOR PATCH is used in patients with severe heart failure , monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure .
5 . 6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long - term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury .
Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion .
In these patients , administration of an NSAID may cause a dose - dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and , secondarily , in renal blood flow , which may precipitate overt renal decompensation .
Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function , dehydration , hypovolemia , heart failure , liver dysfunction , those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs , and the elderly .
Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state .
No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of FLECTOR PATCH in patients with advanced renal disease .
The renal effects of FLECTOR PATCH may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre - existing renal disease .
Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating FLECTOR PATCH .
Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment , heart failure , dehydration , or hypovolemia during use of FLECTOR PATCH [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Avoid the use of FLECTOR PATCH in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function .
If FLECTOR PATCH is used in patients with advanced renal disease , monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function .
Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration , including hyperkalemia , have been reported with use of NSAIDs , even in some patients without renal impairment .
In patients with normal renal function , these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic - hypoaldosteronism state .
5 . 7 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin - sensitive asthma [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs .
5 . 8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin - sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps ; severe , potentially fatal bronchospasm ; and / or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs .
Because cross - reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin - sensitive patients , FLECTOR PATCH is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
When FLECTOR PATCH is used in patients with preexisting asthma ( without known aspirin sensitivity ) , monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma .
5 . 9 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs , including diclofenac , can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis , Stevens - Johnson Syndrome ( SJS ) , and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , which can be fatal .
These serious events may occur without warning .
Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions , and to discontinue the use of FLECTOR PATCH at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity .
FLECTOR PATCH is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 10 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Diclofenac may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus .
Avoid use of NSAIDs , including FLECTOR PATCH , in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation ( third trimester ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 11 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID - treated patients .
This may be due to occult or gross blood loss , fluid retention , or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis .
If a patient treated with FLECTOR PATCH has any signs or symptoms of anemia , monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit .
NSAIDs , including FLECTOR PATCH , may increase the risk of bleeding events .
Co - morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders , concomitant use of warfarin , other anticoagulants , antiplatelet agents ( e . g . , aspirin ) , serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) may increase this risk .
Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 12 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of FLECTOR PATCH in reducing inflammation , and possibly fever , may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections .
5 . 13 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding , hepatotoxicity , and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs , consider monitoring patients on long - term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 14 Accidental Exposure in Children Even a used Flector Patch contains a large amount of diclofenac epolamine ( as much as 170 mg ) .
The potential therefore exists for a small child or pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a new or used Flector Patch .
It is important for patients to store and dispose of Flector Patch out of the reach of children and pets .
5 . 15 Eye Exposure Avoid contact of Flector Patch with eyes and mucosa .
Advise patients that if eye contact occurs , immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and consult a physician if irritation persists for more than an hour .
5 . 16 Oral Nonsteroidal Anti - inflammatory Drugs Concomitant use of oral and topical NSAIDs may result in a higher rate of hemorrhage , more frequent abnormal creatinine , urea and hemoglobin .
Do not use combination therapy with Flector Patch and an oral NSAID unless the benefit outweighs the risk .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling : • Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • GI Bleeding , Ulceration and Perforation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Hepatotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Hypertension [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Heart Failure and Edema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Anaphylactic Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • Serious Skin Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] • Hematologic Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] Most common adverse reactions are application site conditions , occurring in 11 % and 12 % , respectively , of FLECTOR PATCH and Placebo Patch - treated patients ( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Pfizer Inc . at 1 - 800 - 438 - 1985 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In controlled trials during the premarketing development of FLECTOR PATCH , approximately 600 patients with minor sprains , strains , and contusions were treated with FLECTOR PATCH for up to two weeks .
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment In the controlled trials , 3 % of patients in both the FLECTOR PATCH and placebo patch groups discontinued treatment due to an adverse event .
The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were application site reactions , occurring in 2 % of both the FLECTOR PATCH and placebo patch groups .
Application site reactions leading to dropout included pruritus , dermatitis , and burning .
Common Adverse Events Localized Reactions Overall , the most common adverse events associated with FLECTOR PATCH treatment were skin reactions at the site of treatment .
Table 1 lists all adverse events , regardless of causality , occurring in ≥ 1 % of patients in controlled trials of FLECTOR PATCH .
A majority of patients treated with FLECTOR PATCH had adverse events with a maximum intensity of " mild " or " moderate . "

Additionally , the treated area may become irritated or develop itching , erythema , edema , vesicles , or abnormal sensation .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac .
Table 2 : Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with DiclofenacDrugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact : • Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding .
The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone .
• Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis .
Case - control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone .
Intervention : Monitor patients with concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH with anticoagulants ( e . g . , warfarin ) , antiplatelet agents ( e . g . , aspirin ) , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) for signs of bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] .
Aspirin Clinical Impact : Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone .
In a clinical study , the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Intervention : Concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] .
FLECTOR PATCH is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection .
ACE Inhibitors , Angiotensin Receptor Blockers , and Beta - Blockers Clinical Impact : • NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) , or beta - blockers ( including propranolol ) .
• In patients who are elderly , volume - depleted ( including those on diuretic therapy ) , or have renal impairment , co - administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function , including possible acute renal failure .
These effects are usually reversible .
Intervention : • During concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH and ACE - inhibitors , ARBs , or beta - blockers , monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained .
• During concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH and ACE - inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly , volume - depleted , or have impaired renal function , monitor for signs of worsening renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
• When these drugs are administered concomitantly , patients should be adequately hydrated .
Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter .
Diuretics Clinical Impact : Clinical studies , as well as post - marketing observations , showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics ( e . g . , furosemide ) and thiazide diuretics in some patients .
This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis .
Intervention : During concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH with diuretics , observe patients for signs of worsening renal function , in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Digoxin Clinical Impact : The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half - life of digoxin .
Intervention : During concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH and digoxin , monitor serum digoxin levels .
Lithium Clinical Impact : NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance .
The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15 % , and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20 % .
This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis .
Intervention : During concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH and lithium , monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity .
Methotrexate Clinical Impact : Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity ( e . g . , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , renal dysfunction ) .
Intervention : During concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH and methotrexate , monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity .
Cyclosporine Clinical Impact : Concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine ' s nephrotoxicity .
Intervention : During concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH and cyclosporine , monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function .
NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact : Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates ( e . g . , diflunisal , salsalate ) increases the risk of GI toxicity , with little or no increase in efficacy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Intervention : The concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended .
Pemetrexed Clinical Impact : Concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed - associated myelosuppression , renal , and GI toxicity ( see the pemetrexed prescribing information ) .
Intervention : During concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH and pemetrexed , in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL / min , monitor for myelosuppression , renal and GI toxicity .
NSAIDs with short elimination half - lives ( e . g . , diclofenac , indomethacin ) should be avoided for a period of two days before , the day of , and two days following administration of pemetrexed .
In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half - lives ( e . g . , meloxicam , nabumetone ) , patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before , the day of , and two days following pemetrexed administration .
• Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis ( e . g . warfarin , aspirin , SSRIs / SNRIs ) : Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly using FLECTOR PATCH with drugs that interfere with hemostasis .
Concomitant use of FLECTOR PATCH and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended ( 7 ) • ACE Inhibitors , Angiotensin Receptor Blockers ( ARB ) , or Beta - Blockers : Concomitant use with FLECTOR PATCH may diminish the antihypertensive effect of these drugs .
Monitor blood pressure ( 7 ) • ACE Inhibitors and ARBs : Concomitant use with FLECTOR PATCH in elderly , volume depleted , or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function .
In such high risk patients , monitor for signs of worsening renal function ( 7 ) • Diuretics : NSAIDs can reduce natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics .
Monitor patients to assure diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects ( 7 ) • Digoxin : Concomitant use with FLECTOR PATCH may increase serum concentration and prolong half - life of digoxin .
Monitor serum digoxin levels ( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Use of NSAIDs during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus .
Avoid use of NSAIDs in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks gestation ( 5 . 10 , 8 . 1 ) • Infertility : NSAIDs are associated with reversible infertility .
Consider withdrawal of FLECTOR PATCH in women who have difficulties conceiving ( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C prior to 30 weeks gestation ; Category D starting 30 weeks gestation .
Risk Summary Use of NSAIDs , including FLECTOR PATCH , during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus .
Avoid use of NSAIDs , including FLECTOR PATCH , in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation ( third trimester ) .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of FLECTOR PATCH in pregnant women .
Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive .
In the general U . S . population , all clinically recognized pregnancies , regardless of drug exposure , have a background rate of 2 - 4 % for major malformations , and 15 - 20 % for pregnancy loss .
In animal reproduction studies , diclofenac epolamine administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced embryotoxicity at approximately 3 and 7 times , respectively , the topical exposure from the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of FLECTOR PATCH .
In rats , increased incidences of skeletal anomalies and maternal toxicity were also observed at this dose .
Diclofenac epolamine administered orally to both male and female rats prior to mating and throughout the mating period , and during gestation and lactation in females produced embryotoxicity at doses approximately 3 and 7 times , respectively , the topical exposure from the MRHD [ see Data ] .
Based on animal data , prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability , blastocyst implantation , and decidualization .
In animal studies , administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac , resulted in increased pre - and post - implantation loss .
Clinical Considerations Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of FLECTOR PATCH during labor or delivery .
In animal studies , NSAIDS , including diclofenac , inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , cause delayed parturition , and increase the incidence of stillbirth .
Data Animal data Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were administered 1 , 3 , or 6 mg / kg diclofenac epolamine via oral gavage daily from gestation days 6 to 15 .
Maternal toxicity , embryotoxicity , and increased incidence of skeletal anomalies were noted with 6 mg / kg / day diclofenac epolamine , which corresponds to 3 times the maximum recommended daily exposure in humans based on a body surface area comparison .
Pregnant New Zealand White rabbits were administered 1 , 3 , or 6 mg / kg diclofenac epolamine via oral gavage daily from gestation days 6 to 18 .
No maternal toxicity was noted ; however , embryotoxicity was evident at 6 mg / kg / day group which corresponds to 7 times the maximum recommended daily exposure in humans based on a body surface area comparison .
Male rats were orally administered diclofenac epolamine ( 1 , 3 , 6 mg / kg ) for 60 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period , and females were given the same doses 14 days prior to mating and through mating , gestation , and lactation .
Embryotoxicity was observed at 6 mg / kg diclofenac epolamine ( 3 times the maximum recommended daily exposure in humans based on a body surface area comparison ) , and was manifested as an increase in early resorptions , post - implantation losses , and a decrease in live fetuses .
The number of live born and total born were also reduced as was F1 postnatal survival , but the physical and behavioral development of surviving F1 pups in all groups was the same as the deionized water control , nor was reproductive performance adversely affected despite a slight treatment - related reduction in body weight .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on available data , diclofenac may be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for FLECTOR PATCH and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the FLECTOR PATCH or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data One woman treated orally with a diclofenac salt , 150 mg / day , had a milk diclofenac level of 100 mcg / L , equivalent to an infant dose of about 0 . 03 mg / kg / day .
Diclofenac was not detectable in breast milk in 12 women using diclofenac ( after either 100 mg / day orally for 7 days or a single 50 mg intramuscular dose administered in the immediate postpartum period ) .
The relative bioavailability for FLECTOR PATCH is < 1 % of a single 50 mg diclofenac tablet .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action , the use of prostaglandin - mediated NSAIDs , including FLECTOR PATCH may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles , which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women .
Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin - mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation .
Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation .
Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs , including FLECTOR PATCH , in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of FLECTOR PATCH in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients , compared to younger patients , are at greater risk for NSAID - associated serious cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , and / or renal adverse reactions .
If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks , start dosing at the low end of the dosing range , and monitor patients for adverse effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 , 5 . 6 , 5 . 13 ) ] .
Clinical studies of FLECTOR PATCH did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy , drowsiness , nausea , vomiting , and epigastric pain , which have been generally reversible with supportive care .
Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred .
Hypertension , acute renal failure , respiratory depression , and coma have occurred , but were rare [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 , 5 . 4 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage .
There are no specific antidotes .
Forced diuresis , alkalinization of urine , hemodialysis , or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding .
For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center ( 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 ) .
11 DESCRIPTION FLECTOR PATCH ( diclofenac epolamine patch ) is a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , available for topical application .
FLECTOR PATCH is a 10 cm × 14 cm patch comprised of an adhesive material containing 1 . 3 % diclofenac epolamine which is applied to a non - woven polyester felt backing and covered with a polypropylene film release liner .
The release liner is removed prior to topical application to the skin .
The chemical name of diclofenac epolamine is 2 - [ ( 2 , 6 - dichlorophenyl ) amino ] benzeneacetic acid , ( 2 - ( pyrrolidin - 1 - yl ) ethanol salt , with a molecular formula of C20H24Cl2N2O3 , and molecular weight 411 . 3 , an n - octanol / water partition coefficient of 8 at pH 8 . 5 , and the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each adhesive patch contains 180 mg of diclofenac epolamine ( 13 mg per gram adhesive ) in an aqueous base .
It also contains the following inactive ingredients : 1 , 3 - butylene glycol , dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate , disodium edetate , D - sorbitol , fragrance ( Dalin PH ) , gelatin , kaolin , methylparaben , polysorbate 80 , povidone , propylene glycol , propylparaben , sodium carboxymethylcellulose , sodium polyacrylate , tartaric acid , titanium dioxide , and purified water .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Diclofenac has analgesic , anti - inflammatory , and antipyretic properties .
The mechanism of action of diclofenac , like that of other NSAIDs , is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase ( COX - 1 and COX - 2 ) .
Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro .
Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects .
Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models .
Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation .
Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis , its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics FLECTOR PATCH applied to intact skin provides local analgesia by releasing diclofenac epolamine from the patch into the skin .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single application of the FLECTOR PATCH on the upper inner arm , peak plasma concentrations of diclofenac ( range 0 . 7 – 6 ng / mL ) were noted between 10 – 20 hours of application .
Plasma concentrations of diclofenac in the range of 1 . 3 – 8 . 8 ng / mL were noted after five days with twice - a - day FLECTOR PATCH application .
Systemic exposure ( AUC ) and maximum plasma concentrations of diclofenac , after repeated dosing for four days with FLECTOR PATCH , were lower ( < 1 % ) than after a single oral 50 - mg diclofenac sodium tablet .
The pharmacokinetics of FLECTOR PATCH has been tested in healthy volunteers at rest or undergoing moderate exercise ( cycling 20 min / h for 12 h at a mean HR of 100 . 3 bpm ) .
No clinically relevant differences in systemic absorption were observed , with peak plasma concentrations in the range of 2 . 2 – 8 . 1 ng / mL while resting , and 2 . 7 – 7 . 2 ng / mL during exercise .
Distribution Diclofenac has a very high affinity ( > 99 % ) for human serum albumin .
Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid .
Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid , after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels .
It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac .
Elimination Metabolism Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine .
The metabolites include 4 ' - hydroxy - , 5 - hydroxy - , 3 ' - hydroxy - , 4 ' , 5 - dihydroxy - and 3 ' - hydroxy - 4 ' - methoxy diclofenac .
The major diclofenac metabolite , 4 ' hydroxy - diclofenac , has very weak pharmacologic activity .
The formation of 4 ' - hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9 .
Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion .
Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism .
CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites , 5 - hydroxy and 3 ' - hydroxy - diclofenac .
Excretion The plasma elimination half - life of diclofenac after application of FLECTOR PATCH is approximately 12 hours .
Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites .
Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine .
Approximately 65 % of the dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 35 % in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites .
Specific Populations The pharmacokinetics of Flector Patch has not been investigated in children , patients with hepatic or renal impairment , or specific racial groups .
Drug Interaction Studies Aspirin : When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin , the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced , although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered .
The clinical significance of this interaction is not known .
See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of either diclofenac epolamine or FLECTOR PATCH .
Mutagenesis Diclofenac epolamine is not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains , nor does it induce an increase in metabolic aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes , or the frequency of micronucleated cells in the bone marrow micronucleus test performed in rats .
Impairment of Fertility The effect of diclofenac epolamine on fertility in animals has been summarized in 8 . 1 under Animal Data .
Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were administered 1 , 3 , or 6 mg / kg / day diclofenac epolamine via oral gavage ( males treated for 60 days prior to conception and during mating period , females treated for 14 days prior to mating through day 19 of gestation ) .
Diclofenac epolamine treatment with 6 mg / kg / day resulted in increased early resorptions and post - implantation losses ; however , no effects on the mating and fertility indices were found .
The 6 mg / kg / day dose corresponds to 3 times the maximum recommended daily exposure in humans based on a body surface area comparison .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Ankle Sprains Efficacy of FLECTOR PATCH was demonstrated in two of four studies of patients with minor sprains , strains , and contusions .
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with the FLECTOR PATCH , or a placebo patch identical to the FLECTOR PATCH minus the active ingredient .
In the first of these two studies , patients with ankle sprains were treated once daily for a week .
In the second study , patients with sprains , strains and contusions were treated twice daily for up to two weeks .
Pain was assessed over the period of treatment .
Patients treated with the FLECTOR PATCH experienced a greater reduction in pain as compared to patients randomized to placebo patch as evidenced by the responder curves presented below ( Figures 1 - 4 ) .
