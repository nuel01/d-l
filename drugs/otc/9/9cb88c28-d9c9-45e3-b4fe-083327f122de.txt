[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Penciclovir is an antiviral agent active against alpha herpes viruses [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Measurable penciclovir concentrations were not detected in plasma or urine of healthy male volunteers ( n = 12 ) following single or repeat application of the 1 % cream at a dose of 180 mg penciclovir daily ( approximately 67 times the estimated usual clinical dose ) .
Pediatric Patients The systemic absorption of penciclovir following topical administration has not been evaluated in patients < 18 years of age .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Penciclovir has inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 ( HSV - 1 ) and 2 ( HSV - 2 ) .
In cells infected with HSV - 1 or HSV - 2 , the viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form that , in turn , is converted by cellular kinases to the active form penciclovir triphosphate .
Biochemical studies demonstrate that penciclovir triphosphate inhibits HSV DNA polymerase competitively with deoxyguanosine triphosphate .
Consequently , α - herpes viral DNA synthesis and , therefore , replication are selectively inhibited .
Penciclovir triphosphate has an intracellular half - life of 10 hours in HSV - 1 and 20 hours in HSV - 2 infected cells grown in culture .
However , the clinical significance of the intracellular half - life is unknown .
Antiviral Activity In cell culture studies , penciclovir has antiviral activity against the following herpes viruses : HSV - 1 and HSV - 2 .
The antiviral activity of penciclovir against wild type strains grown on human foreskin fibroblasts was assessed with a plaque reduction assay and staining with crystal violet 3 days post - infection for HSV .
The median EC50 values of penciclovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HSV - 1 and HSV - 2 were 2 μM ( range 1 . 2 to 2 . 4 μM , n = 7 ) and 2 . 6 μM ( range 1 . 6 to 11 μM , n = 6 ) , respectively .
Resistance In Cell Culture Penciclovir - resistant HSV - 1 and HSV - 2 strains were isolated in cell culture .
Penciclovir - resistant mutants of HSV resulted from mutations in the viral thymidine kinase ( TK ) and DNA polymerase ( POL ) genes .
Frameshifts were commonly isolated and result in premature truncation of the HSV TK product with decreased enzymatic activity and consequent decreased susceptibility to penciclovir .
Mutations in the viral TK gene may lead to complete loss of TK activity ( TK negative ) , reduced levels of TK activity ( TK partial ) , or alteration in the ability of viral TK to phosphorylate the drug without an equivalent loss in the ability to phosphorylate thymidine ( TK altered ) .
In cell culture , the following resistance - associated substitutions in TK of HSV - 1 and HSV - 2 were observed : HSV - 1 TK G6C , F13L , H142Y , G200D , L205S , S254Stop , V267G , and T287M ; HSV - 2 TK G39E , F191L , E226K , and T288M .
The median EC50 values observed in a plaque reduction assay with penciclovir resistant HSV - 1 and HSV - 2 were 69 μM ( range 14 to 115 μM , n = 6 ) and 46 μM ( range 4 to > 395 μM , n = 9 ) , respectively .
Resistance and Cross - resistance in Clinical Isolates from HSV - Infected Patients Clinical HSV - 1 and HSV - 2 isolates obtained from patients who failed treatment with acyclovir for their α - herpesvirus infections were evaluated for genotypic changes in the TK and POL genes .
These HSV isolates had frameshift mutations leading to loss of thymidine kinase or had substitutions in the viral thymidine kinase and viral DNA polymerase .
Phenotypic analysis of these clinical isolates confirmed resistance to penciclovir and acyclovir .
These and other resistance - associated substitutions reported in the literature , or observed in clinical trials , are listed in Table 2 .
The list is not all inclusive and additional changes will likely be identified in HSV variants isolated from patients who fail penciclovir containing regimens .
The possibility of viral resistance to penciclovir should be considered in patients who fail to respond or experience recurrent viral shedding during therapy .

However , for the purpose of inter - species dose comparisons presented in the following sections , an assumption of 100 % absorption of penciclovir from the topically applied product has been used .
Based on the use of the maximal recommended topical dose of penciclovir of 0 . 05 mg / kg / day and an assumption of 100 % absorption , the maximum theoretical plasma AUC0 - 24 hrs for penciclovir is approximately 0 . 129 mcg . hr / mL .
Carcinogenesis Two - year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with famciclovir ( the oral prodrug of penciclovir ) in rats and mice .
An increase in the incidence of mammary adenocarcinoma ( a common tumor in female rats of the strain used ) was seen in female rats receiving 600 mg / kg / day ( approximately 395 x the maximum theoretical human exposure to penciclovir following application of the topical product , based on area under the plasma concentration curve comparisons [ 24 hr .
AUC ] ) .
No increases in tumor incidence were seen among male rats treated at doses up to 240 mg / kg / day ( approximately 190 x the maximum theoretical human AUC for penciclovir ) , or in male and female mice at doses up to 600 mg / kg / day ( approximately 100 x the maximum theoretical human AUC for penciclovir ) .
Mutagenesis When tested in vitro , penciclovir did not cause an increase in gene mutation in the Ames assay using multiple strains of S . typhimurium or E . coli ( at up to 20 , 000 mcg / plate ) , nor did it cause an increase in unscheduled DNA repair in mammalian HeLa S3 cells ( at up to 5 , 000 mcg / mL ) .
However , an increase in clastogenic responses was seen with penciclovir in the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell assay ( at doses ≥ 1000 mcg / mL ) and , in human lymphocytes incubated in vitro at doses ≥ 250 mcg / mL .
When tested in vivo , penciclovir caused an increase in micronuclei in mouse bone marrow following the intravenous administration of doses ≥ 500 mg / kg ( ≥ 810 x the maximum human dose , based on body surface area conversion ) .
Impairment of Fertility Testicular toxicity was observed in multiple animal species ( rats and dogs ) following repeated intravenous administration of penciclovir ( 160 mg / kg / day and 100 mg / kg / day , respectively , approximately 1155 and 3255 x the maximum theoretical human AUC ) .
Testicular changes seen in both species included atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and reductions in epididymal sperm counts and / or an increased incidence of sperm with abnormal morphology or reduced motility .
Adverse testicular effects were related to an increasing dose or duration of exposure to penciclovir .
No adverse testicular or reproductive effects ( fertility and reproductive function ) were observed in rats after 10 to 13 weeks dosing at 80 mg / kg / day , or testicular effects in dogs after 13 weeks dosing at 30 mg / kg / day ( 575 and 845 x the maximum theoretical human AUC , respectively ) .
Intravenously administered penciclovir had no effect on fertility or reproductive performance in female rats at doses of up to 80 mg / kg / day ( 260 x the maximum human dose [ BSA ] ) .
There was no evidence of any clinically significant effects on sperm count , motility or morphology in 2 placebo - controlled clinical trials of Famvir ® ( famciclovir [ the oral prodrug of penciclovir ] , 250 mg twice daily ; n = 66 ) in immunocompetent men with recurrent genital herpes , when dosing and follow - up were maintained for 18 and 8 weeks , respectively ( approximately 2 and 1 spermatogenic cycles in the human ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Penciclovir cream was studied in two double - blind , placebo ( vehicle ) - controlled trials for the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis in which otherwise healthy adults were randomized to either penciclovir cream or placebo .
Therapy was to be initiated by the subjects within 1 hour of noticing signs or symptoms and continued for 4 days , with application of study medication every 2 hours while awake .
In both studies , the mean duration of lesions was approximately one - half - day shorter in the subjects treated with penciclovir cream ( N = 1 , 516 ) as compared to subjects treated with placebo ( N = 1 , 541 ) ( approximately 4 . 5 days versus 5 days , respectively ) .
The mean duration of lesion pain was also approximately one half - day shorter in the penciclovir cream group compared to the placebo group .
