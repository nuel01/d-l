( 5 . 13 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Non - infectious Pneumonitis Non - infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives .
Non - infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19 % of patients treated with everolimus tablets in clinical trials , some cases were reported with pulmonary hypertension ( including pulmonary arterial hypertension ) as a secondary event .
The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non - infectious pneumonitis was up to 4 % and up to 0 . 2 % , respectively [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Fatal outcomes have been observed .
Consider a diagnosis of non - infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non - specific respiratory signs and symptoms .
Consider opportunistic infections , such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia ( PJP ) in the differential diagnosis .
Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms .
Continue everolimus tablets without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non - infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms .
Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis .
For Grade 2 to 4 non - infectious pneumonitis , withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets based on severity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 9 ) ] .
Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve .
Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required .
The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose .
5 . 2 Infections Everolimus tablets have immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial , fungal , viral , or protozoal infections , including infections with opportunistic pathogens [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Localized and systemic infections , including pneumonia , mycobacterial infections , other bacterial infections , invasive fungal infections ( e . g . , aspergillosis , candidiasis , or PJP ) and viral infections ( e . g . , reactivation of hepatitis B virus ) have occurred .
Some of these infections have been severe ( e . g . , sepsis , septic shock , or resulting in multisystem organ failure ) or fatal .
The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections was up to 10 % and up to 3 % , respectively .
The incidence of serious infections was reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Complete treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection .
Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets based on severity of infection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 9 ) ] .
Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required .

Permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for the development of clinically significant hypersensitivity .
5 . 4 Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin - Converting Enzyme ( ACE ) Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with everolimus tablets may be at increased risk for angioedema ( e . g . , swelling of the airways or tongue , with or without respiratory impairment ) .
In a pooled analysis of randomized double - blind oncology clinical trials , the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus tablets with an ACE inhibitor was 6 . 8 % compared to 1 . 3 % in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor .
Permanently discontinue everolimus tablets for angioedema .
5 . 5 Stomatitis Stomatitis , including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis , has occurred in patients treated with everolimus tablets at an incidence ranging from 44 % to 78 % across clinical trials .
Grades 3 - 4 stomatitis was reported in 4 % to 9 % of patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment .
When starting everolimus tablets , initiating dexamethasone alcohol - free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
If stomatitis does occur , mouthwashes and / or other topical treatments are recommended .
Avoid alcohol - , hydrogen peroxide - , iodine - , or thyme - containing products , as they may exacerbate the condition .
Do not administer antifungal agents , unless fungal infection has been diagnosed .
5 . 6 Renal Failure Cases of renal failure ( including acute renal failure ) , some with a fatal outcome , have occurred in patients taking everolimus tablets .
Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 elevations of serum creatinine was up to 2 % and up to 1 % , respectively .
The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 proteinuria was up to 1 % and up to 0 . 5 % , respectively .
Monitor renal function prior to starting everolimus tablets and annually thereafter .
Monitor renal function at least every 6 months in patients who have additional risk factors for renal failure .
5 . 7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway .
Therefore , everolimus tablets have the potential to adversely affect wound healing .
Withhold everolimus tablets for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery .
Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing .
The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established .
5 . 8 Geriatric Patients In the randomized hormone receptor - positive , HER2 - negative breast cancer study ( BOLERO - 2 ) , the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last everolimus tablets dose was 6 % in patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to 2 % in patients < 65 years of age .
Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33 % of patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to 17 % in patients < 65 years of age .
Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 9 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
5 . 9 Metabolic Disorders Hyperglycemia , hypercholesterolemia , and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets at an incidence up to 75 % , 86 % , and 73 % , respectively .
The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 15 % and up to 0 . 4 % , respectively [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In non - diabetic patients , monitor fasting serum glucose prior to starting everolimus tablets and annually thereafter .
In diabetic patients , monitor fasting serum glucose more frequently as clinically indicated .
Monitor lipid profile prior to starting everolimus tablets and annually thereafter .
When possible , achieve optimal glucose and lipid control prior to starting everolimus tablets .
For Grade 3 to 4 metabolic events , withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets based on severity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 9 ) ] .
5 . 10 Myelosuppression Anemia , lymphopenia , neutropenia , and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients taking everolimus tablets .
The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 16 % and up to 2 % , respectively [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor complete blood count ( CBC ) prior to starting everolimus tablets every 6 months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter .
Withhold or permanently discontinue everolimus tablets based on severity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 9 ) ] .
5 . 11 Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination The safety of immunization with live vaccines during everolimus tablets therapy has not been studied .
Due to the potential increased risk of infection , avoid the use of live vaccines and close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines during treatment with everolimus tablets .
Due to the potential increased risk of infection or reduced immune response with vaccination , complete the recommended childhood series of vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) guidelines prior to the start of therapy .
An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate .
5 . 12 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Radiation sensitization and recall , in some cases severe , involving cutaneous and visceral organs ( including radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis ) have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to , during , or subsequent to everolimus tablets treatment [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Monitor patients closely when everolimus tablets are administered during or sequentially with radiation treatment .
5 . 13 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action , everolimus tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In animal studies , everolimus caused embryo - fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg once daily .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets and for 8 weeks after the last dose .
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets and for 4 weeks after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .

7 . 2 Effects of Combination Use of Angiotensin - Converting Enzyme ( ACE ) Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with everolimus tablets may be at increased risk for angioedema .
Avoid the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors with everolimus tablets [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
8 .
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • For breast cancer , NET , RCC , or TSC - associated renal angiomyolipoma patients with hepatic impairment , reduce the dose .
( 2 . 10 , 8 . 6 ) • For patients with TSC - associated SEGA and severe hepatic impairment , reduce the starting dose and adjust dose to attain target trough concentrations .
( 2 . 8 , 2 . 10 , 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , everolimus tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are limited case reports of everolimus tablets use in pregnant women ; however , these reports are not sufficient to inform about risks of birth defects or miscarriage .
In animal studies , everolimus caused embryo - fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies , respectively .
Data Animal Data In animal reproductive studies , oral administration of everolimus to female rats before mating and through organogenesis induced embryo - fetal toxicities , including increased resorption , pre - implantation and post - implantation loss , decreased numbers of live fetuses , malformation ( e . g . , sternal cleft ) , and retarded skeletal development .
These effects occurred in the absence of maternal toxicities .
Embryo - fetal toxicities in rats occurred at doses ≥ 0 . 1 mg / kg ( 0 . 6 mg / m2 ) with resulting exposures of approximately 4 % of the human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily based on area under the curve ( AUC ) .
In rabbits , embryo - toxicity evident as an increase in resorptions occurred at an oral dose of 0 . 8 mg / kg ( 9 . 6 mg / m2 ) , approximately 1 . 6 times the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily or the median dose administered to patients with tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) - associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma ( SEGA ) , based on BSA .
The effect in rabbits occurred in the presence of maternal toxicities .
In a pre - and post - natal development study in rats , animals were dosed from implantation through lactation .
At the dose of 0 . 1 mg / kg ( 0 . 6 mg / m2 ) , there were no adverse effects on delivery and lactation or signs of maternal toxicity ; however , there were reductions in body weight ( up to 9 % reduction from the control ) and in survival of offspring ( ~ 5 % died or missing ) .
There were no drug - related effects on the developmental parameters ( morphological development , motor activity , learning , or fertility assessment ) in the offspring .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of everolimus or its metabolites in human milk , the effects of everolimus on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
Everolimus and its metabolites passed into the milk of lactating rats at a concentration 3 . 5 times higher than in maternal serum .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from everolimus , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with everolimus tablets and for 2 weeks after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting everolimus tablets [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Everolimus tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females : Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets and for 8 weeks after the last dose .
Males : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with everolimus tablets and for 4 weeks after the last dose .
Infertility Females : Menstrual irregularities , secondary amenorrhea , and increases in luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) occurred in female patients taking everolimus tablets .
Based on these findings , everolimus tablets may impair fertility in female patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Males : Cases of reversible azoospermia have been reported in male patients taking everolimus tablets .
In male rats , sperm motility , sperm count , plasma testosterone levels and fertility were diminished at AUC similar to those of the clinical dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily .
Based on these findings , everolimus tablets may impair fertility in male patients [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use TSC - Associated SEGA The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets have been established in pediatric patients age 1 year and older with TSC - associated SEGA that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected .
Use of everolimus tablets for this indication is supported by evidence from a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial in adult and pediatric patients ( EXIST - 1 ) ; an open - label , single - arm trial in adult and pediatric patients ( Study 2485 ) ; and additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with TSC - associated SEGA .
In EXIST - 1 , the incidence of infections and serious infections were reported at a higher frequency in patients < 6 years of age .
Ninety - six percent of 23 everolimus tablets - treated patients < 6 years had at least one infection compared to 67 % of 55 everolimus tablets - treated patients ≥ 6 years .
Thirty - five percent of 23 everolimus tablets - treated patients < 6 years of age had at least 1 serious infection compared to 7 % of 55 everolimus tablets - treated patients ≥ 6 years .
Although a conclusive determination cannot be made due to the limited number of patients and lack of a comparator arm in the open label follow - up periods of EXIST - 1 and Study 2485 , everolimus tablets did not appear to adversely impact growth and pubertal development in the 115 pediatric patients treated with everolimus tablets for a median duration of 4 . 1 years .
Other Indications The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets in pediatric patients have not been established in : • Hormone receptor - positive , HER2 - negative breast cancer • Neuroendocrine tumors ( NET ) • Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) • TSC - associated renal angiomyolipoma 8 . 5 Geriatric Use In BOLERO - 2 , 40 % of patients with breast cancer treated with everolimus tablets were ≥ 65 years of age , while 15 % were ≥ 75 years of age .
No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients .
The incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last everolimus tablets dose was 6 % in patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to 2 % in patients < 65 years of age .
Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33 % of patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to 17 % in patients < 65 years of age .
In RECORD - 1 , 41 % of patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with everolimus tablets were ≥ 65 years of age , while 7 % were ≥ 75 years of age .
In RADIANT - 3 , 30 % of patients with PNET treated with everolimus tablets were ≥ 65 years of age , while 7 % were ≥ 75 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Everolimus tablets exposure may increase in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
For patients with breast cancer , NET , RCC , and TSC - associated renal angiomyolipoma who have hepatic impairment , reduce the everolimus tablets dose as recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 10 ) ] .
For patients with TSC - associated SEGA who have severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class C ) , reduce the starting dose of everolimus tablets as recommended and adjust the dose based on everolimus trough concentrations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 8 , 2 . 10 ) ] .

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) , a serine - threonine kinase , downstream of the PI3K / AKT pathway .
The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) .
Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein , FKBP - 12 , resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity .
Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase ( S6K1 ) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E - binding protein ( 4 E - BP1 ) , downstream effectors of mTOR , involved in protein synthesis .
S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand - independent activation of the receptor .
In addition , everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia - inducible factor ( e . g . , HIF - 1 ) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) .
Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation , angiogenesis , and glucose uptake in in vitro and / or in vivo studies .
Constitutive activation of the PI3K / Akt / mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer .
In vitro studies show that estrogen - dependent and HER2 + breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus , and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt , HER2 , or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti - tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner .
Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin - sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 ( TSC1 , TSC2 ) .
Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling .
In TSC , a genetic disorder , inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis .
Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia , aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation , increased excitatory synaptic currents , reduced myelination , and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function .
Treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in animal models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain resulted in seizure suppression , prevention of the development of new - onset seizures , and prevention of premature death .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure - Response Relationship In patients with TSC - associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma ( SEGA ) , the magnitude of the reduction in SEGA volume was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration .
Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized , placebo - controlled , cross - over study , 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of everolimus tablets ( 20 mg and 50 mg ) and placebo .
Everolimus tablets at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT / QTc interval .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After administration of everolimus tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors , peak everolimus concentrations are reached 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg .
Following single doses , Cmax is dose - proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg .
With single doses of 20 mg and higher , the increase in Cmax is less than dose - proportional ; however , AUC shows dose - proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range .
Steady - state was achieved within 2 weeks following once - daily dosing .
In patients with TSC - associated SEGA , everolimus Cmin was approximately dose - proportional within the dose range from 1 . 35 mg / m2 to 14 . 4 mg / m2 .
Effect of Food : In healthy subjects , a high - fat meal ( containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat ) reduced systemic exposure to everolimus tablets 10 mg ( as measured by AUC ) by 22 % and the peak blood concentration Cmax by 54 % .
Light - fat meals ( containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat ) reduced AUC by 32 % and Cmax by 42 % .
Relative Bioavailability : The AUCinf of everolimus was equivalent between everolimus tablets for oral suspension and everolimus tablets ; the Cmax of everolimus in the everolimus tablets for oral suspension dosage form was 20 % to 36 % lower than that of everolimus tablets .
The predicted trough concentrations at steady - state were similar after daily administration .
Distribution The blood - to - plasma ratio of everolimus , which is concentration - dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng / mL , is 17 % to 73 % .
The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20 % at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily .
Plasma protein binding is approximately 74 % both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment .
Elimination The mean elimination half - life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours .
Metabolism : Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 .
Following oral administration , everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood .
Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood , including three monohydroxylated metabolites , two hydrolytic ring - opened products , and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus .
These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies , and showed approximately 100 - times less activity than everolimus itself .
Excretion : No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients .
Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine , 80 % of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces , while 5 % was excreted in the urine .
The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces .
Specific Populations No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients with cancer .
Patients with Renal Impairment : No significant influence of creatinine clearance ( 25 to 178 mL / min ) was detected on oral clearance ( CL / F ) of everolimus .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Compared to normal subjects , there was a 1 . 8 - fold , 3 . 2 - fold , and 3 . 6 - fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild ( Child - Pugh class A ) , moderate ( Child - Pugh class B ) , and severe ( Child - Pugh class C ) hepatic impairment , respectively .
In another study , the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 10 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients : In patients with TSC - associated SEGA , the mean Cmin values normalized to mg / m2 dose in pediatric patients ( < 18 years of age ) were lower than those observed in adults , suggesting that everolimus clearance adjusted to BSA was higher in pediatric patients as compared to adults .
Race or Ethnicity : Based on a cross - study comparison , Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non - Japanese patients receiving the same dose .
Oral clearance ( CL / F ) is on average 20 % higher in Black patients than in White patients .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of CYP3A4 and P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) Inhibitors on Everolimus : Everolimus exposure increased when everolimus tablets were coadministered with : • ketoconazole ( a P - gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ) - Cmax and AUC increased by 3 . 9 - and 15 - fold , respectively .
• erythromycin ( a P - gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor ) - Cmax and AUC increased by 2 - and 4 . 4 - fold , respectively .
• verapamil ( a P - gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor ) - Cmax and AUC increased by 2 . 3 - and 3 . 5 - fold , respectively .
Effect of CYP3A4 and P - gp Inducers on Everolimus : The coadministration of everolimus tablets with rifampin , a P - gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4 , decreased everolimus AUC by 63 % and Cmax by 58 % compared to everolimus tablets alone [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 12 ) ] .
Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates : No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between everolimus tablets and the HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin ( a CYP3A4 substrate ) , pravastatin ( a non - CYP3A4 substrate ) , and simvastatin ( a CYP3A4 substrate ) .
The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam ( sensitive CYP3A4 substrate ) with everolimus tablets resulted in a 25 % increase in midazolam Cmax and a 30 % increase in midazolam AUC0 - inf .
The coadministration of everolimus tablets with exemestane increased exemestane Cmin by 45 % and C2h by 64 % ; however , the corresponding estradiol levels at steady state ( 4 weeks ) were not different between the 2 treatment arms .
No increase in adverse reactions related to exemestane was observed in patients with hormone receptor - positive , HER2 - negative advanced breast cancer receiving the combination .
The coadministration of everolimus tablets with long - acting octreotide increased octreotide Cmin by approximately 50 % .
Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic Drugs ( AEDs ) : Everolimus increased pre - dose concentrations of the carbamazepine , clobazam , oxcarbazepine , and clobazam ' s metabolite N - desmethylclobazam by about 10 % .
Everolimus had no impact on pre - dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 ( e . g . , clonazepam and zonisamide ) or other AEDs , including valproic acid , topiramate , phenobarbital , and phenytoin .

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Administration of everolimus for up to 2 years did not indicate oncogenic potential in mice and rats up to the highest doses tested ( 0 . 9 mg / kg ) corresponding , respectively to 3 . 9 and 0 . 2 times the estimated human exposure based on AUC at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily .
Everolimus was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro assays ( Ames mutation test in Salmonella , mutation test in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells , and chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster cells ) .
Everolimus was not genotoxic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test at doses up to 500 mg / kg / day ( 1500 mg / m2 / day , approximately 255 - fold the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily , and approximately 200 - fold the median dose administered to patients with TSC - associated SEGA , based on the BSA ) , administered as 2 doses , 24 hours apart .
Based on non - clinical findings , everolimus tablets may impair male fertility .
In a 13 - week male fertility study in rats , testicular morphology was affected at doses of 0 . 5 mg / kg and above .
Sperm motility , sperm count , and plasma testosterone levels were diminished in rats treated with 5 mg / kg .
The exposures at these doses ( 52 ng ∙ hr / mL and 414 ng ∙ hr / mL , respectively ) were within the range of human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily ( 560 ng ∙ hr / mL ) and resulted in infertility in the rats at 5 mg / kg .
Effects on male fertility occurred at AUC0 - 24 h values 10 % to 81 % lower than human exposure at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily .
After a 10 - 13 week non - treatment period , the fertility index increased from zero ( infertility ) to 60 % .
Oral doses of everolimus in female rats at doses ≥ 0 . 1 mg / kg ( approximately 4 % the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended dose of everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily ) resulted in increased incidence of pre - implantation loss , suggesting that the drug may reduce female fertility .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In juvenile rat toxicity studies , dose - related delayed attainment of developmental landmarks , including delayed eye - opening , delayed reproductive development in males and females and increased latency time during the learning and memory phases were observed at doses as low as 0 . 15 mg / kg / day .

CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Hormone Receptor - Positive , HER2 - Negative Breast Cancer A randomized , double - blind , multicenter study ( BOLERO - 2 , NCT00863655 ) of everolimus tablets in combination with exemestane vs . placebo in combination with exemestane was conducted in 724 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor - positive , HER2 - negative advanced breast cancer with recurrence or progression following prior therapy with letrozole or anastrozole .
Randomization was stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy ( yes vs . no ) and by the presence of visceral metastasis ( yes vs . no ) .
Sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either ( 1 ) documented clinical benefit ( complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] , stable disease ≥ 24 weeks ) to at least one prior hormonal therapy in the advanced setting or ( 2 ) at least 24 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to recurrence .
Patients were permitted to have received 0 - 1 prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease .
The major efficacy outcome measure was progression - free survival ( PFS ) evaluated by RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ) , based on investigator ( local radiology ) assessment .
Other outcome measures included overall survival ( OS ) and objective response rate ( ORR ) .
Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to everolimus tablets 10 mg orally once daily in combination with exemestane 25 mg once daily ( n = 485 ) or to placebo in combination with exemestane 25 mg orally once daily ( n = 239 ) .
The two treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to baseline demographics and disease characteristics .
Patients were not permitted to cross over to everolimus tablets at the time of disease progression .
The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS by investigator assessment ( Table 20 and Figure 1 ) .
The results of the PFS analysis based on independent central radiological assessment were consistent with the investigator assessment .
PFS results were also consistent across the subgroups of age , race , presence and extent of visceral metastases , and sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy .
ORR was higher in the everolimus tablets in combination with exemestane arm vs . the placebo in combination with exemestane arm ( Table 20 ) .
There were 3 complete responses ( 0 . 6 % ) and 58 partial responses ( 12 % ) in the everolimus tablets arm .
There were no complete responses and 4 partial responses ( 1 . 7 % ) in the placebo in combination with exemestane arm .
After a median follow - up of 39 . 3 months , there was no statistically significant difference in OS between the everolimus tablets in combination with exemestane arm and the placebo in combination with exemestane arm [ HR 0 . 89 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 73 , 1 . 10 ) ] .

Patients were stratified by prior cytotoxic chemotherapy ( yes vs . no ) and WHO performance status ( 0 vs . 1 and 2 ) .
Treatment with somatostatin analogs was allowed as part of BSC .
The major efficacy outcome was PFS evaluated by RECIST .
After documented radiological progression , patients randomized to placebo could receive open - label everolimus tablets .
Other outcome measures included ORR , response duration , and OS .
Patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either everolimus tablets 10 mg once daily ( n = 207 ) or placebo ( n = 203 ) .
Demographics were well balanced ( median age 58 years , 55 % male , 79 % White ) .
Of the 203 patients randomized to BSC , 172 patients ( 85 % ) received everolimus tablets following documented radiologic progression .
The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS ( Table 21 and Figure 2 ) .
PFS improvement was observed across all patient subgroups , irrespective of prior somatostatin analog use .
The PFS results by investigator radiological review , central radiological review and adjudicated radiological review are shown below in Table 21 .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] NET of Gastrointestinal ( GI ) or Lung Origin A randomized , double - blind , multicenter study ( RADIANT - 4 , NCT01524783 ) of everolimus tablets in combination with BSC compared to placebo in combination with BSC was conducted in patients with unresectable , locally advanced or metastatic , well differentiated , non - functional NET of GI ( excluding pancreatic ) or lung origin .
The study required that patients had well - differentiated ( low or intermediate grade ) histology , no prior or current history of carcinoid symptoms , and evidence of disease progression within 6 months prior to randomization .
Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive either everolimus tablets 10 mg once daily or placebo , and stratified by prior somatostatin analog use ( yes vs . no ) , tumor origin and WHO performance status ( 0 vs . 1 ) .
The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS based on independent radiological assessment evaluated by RECIST .
Additional efficacy outcome measures were OS and ORR .
A total of 302 patients were randomized , 205 to the everolimus tablets arm and 97 to the placebo arm .
The median age was 63 years ( 22 to 86 years ) ; 47 % were male ; 76 % were White ; 74 % had WHO performance status of 0 and 26 % had WHO performance status of 1 .
The most common primary sites of tumor were lung ( 30 % ) , ileum ( 24 % ) , and rectum ( 13 % ) .
The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS per independent radiological review ( Table 22 and Figure 3 ) .
The final OS analysis did not show a statistically significant difference between those patients who received everolimus tablets or placebo ( HR = 0 . 90 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 66 , 1 . 24 ] ) .

Figure 3 : Kaplan - Meier Curves for Progression - Free Survival in NET of GI or Lung Origin in RADIANT - 4 [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Lack of Efficacy in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Functional Carcinoid Tumors The safety and effectiveness of everolimus tablets in patients with locally advanced or metastatic functional carcinoid tumors have not been demonstrated .
In a randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , double - blind , multi - center trial ( RADIANT - 2 , NCT00412061 ) in 429 patients with carcinoid tumors , everolimus tablets in combination with long - acting octreotide ( Sandostatin LAR ® ) was compared to placebo in combination with long - acting octreotide .
After documented radiological progression , patients on the placebo arm could receive everolimus tablets ; of those randomized to placebo , 67 % received open - label everolimus tablets in combination with long - acting octreotide .
The study did not meet its major efficacy outcome measure of a statistically significant improvement in PFS and the final analysis of OS favored the placebo in combination with long - acting octreotide arm .
14 . 3 Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC ) An international , multi - center , randomized , double - blind trial ( RECORD - 1 , NCT00410124 ) comparing everolimus tablets 10 mg once daily and placebo , both in conjunction with BSC , was conducted in patients with metastatic RCC whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with sunitinib , sorafenib , or both sequentially .
Prior therapy with bevacizumab , interleukin 2 , or interferon - α was also permitted .
Randomization was stratified according to prognostic score and prior anticancer therapy .
The major efficacy outcome measure for the trial was PFS evaluated by RECIST , based on a blinded , independent , central radiologic review .
After documented radiological progression , patients randomized to placebo could receive open - label everolimus tablets .
Other outcome measures included OS .
In total , 416 patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive everolimus tablets ( n = 277 ) or placebo ( n = 139 ) .
Demographics were well balanced between the arms ( median age 61 years ; 77 % male , 88 % White , 74 % received prior sunitinib or sorafenib , and 26 % received both sequentially ) .
Everolimus tablets were superior to placebo for PFS ( Table 23 and Figure 4 ) .
The treatment effect was similar across prognostic scores and prior sorafenib and / or sunitinib .
Final OS results yield a hazard ratio of 0 . 90 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 71 , 1 . 14 ) , with no statistically significant difference between the arms .
Planned cross - over from placebo due to disease progression to open - label everolimus tablets occurred in 80 % of the 139 patients and may have confounded the OS benefit .

The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of ≥ 3 cm in longest diameter on CT / MRI based on local radiology assessment , no immediate indication for surgery , and age ≥ 18 years .
Patients received everolimus tablets 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline , 12 , 24 , and 48 weeks and annually thereafter .
Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation .
The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review , which was defined as a ≥ 50 % reduction in angiomyolipoma volume , absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion ≥ 1 cm , absence of kidney volume increase ≥ 20 % , and no angiomyolipoma related bleeding of ≥ Grade 2 .
Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate .
The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized .
The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme - inducing antiepileptic drugs ( EIAEDs ) at randomization ( yes vs . no ) .
Of the 118 patients enrolled , 79 were randomized to everolimus tablets and 39 to placebo .
The median age was 31 years ( 18 to 61 years ) , 34 % were male , and 89 % were White .
At baseline , 17 % of patients were receiving EIAEDs .

The median values for the sum of all target renal angiomyolipoma lesions at baseline were 85 cm3 ( 9 to 1612 cm3 ) and 120 cm3 ( 3 to 4520 cm3 ) in the everolimus tablets and placebo arms , respectively .
Forty - six ( 39 % ) patients had prior renal embolization or nephrectomy .
The median duration of follow - up was 8 . 3 months ( 0 . 7 to 24 . 8 mo nths ) at the time of the primary analysis .
The renal angiomyolipoma response rate was statistically significantly higher in everolimus tablets - treated patients ( Table 24 ) .
The median response duration was 5 . 3 + months ( 2 . 3 + to 19 . 6 + months ) .
There were 3 patients in the everolimus tablets arm and 8 patients in the placebo arm with documented angiomyolipoma progression by central radiologic review ( defined as a ≥ 25 % increase from nadir in the sum of angiomyolipoma target lesion volumes to a value greater than baseline , appearance of a new angiomyolipoma ≥ 1 cm in longest diameter , an increase in renal volume ≥ 20 % from nadir for either kidney and to a value greater than baseline , or Grade ≥ 2 angiomyolipoma - related bleeding ) .
The time to angiomyolipoma progression was statistically significantly longer in the everolimus tablets arm ( HR 0 . 08 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 02 , 0 . 37 ] ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .
Table 24 : Angiomyolipoma Response Rate in TSC - Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma in EXIST - 2 Everolimus Tablets N = 79 Placebo N = 39 p - value Primary Analysis Angiomyolipoma response rate [ 1 ] - ( % ) 41 . 8 0 < 0 . 0001 95 % CI ( 30 . 8 , 53 . 4 ) ( 0 . 0 , 9 . 0 ) [ 1 ] Per independent central radiology review Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the everolimus tablets arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry .
The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the everolimus tablets arm ( 26 % vs . 0 , p = 0 . 0011 ) ; all skin lesion responses were partial responses , defined as visual improvement in 50 % to 99 % of all skin lesions durable for at least 8 weeks ( Physician ' s Global Assessment of Clinical Condition ) .
Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive everolimus tablets at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis .
After the primary analysis , patients treated with everolimus tablets underwent additional follow - up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow - up after the last patient was randomized .
A total of 112 patients ( 79 randomized to everolimus tablets and 33 randomized to placebo ) received at least one dose of everolimus tablets .
The median duration of everolimus tablets treatment was 3 . 9 years ( 0 . 5 months to 5 . 3 years ) and the median duration of follow - up was 3 . 9 years ( 0 . 9 months to 5 . 4 years ) .
During the follow - up period after the primary analysis , 32 patients ( in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis ) had an angiomyolipoma response based upon independent central radiology review .
Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients , the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2 . 9 months ( 2 . 6 to 33 . 8 months ) .
Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with everolimus tablets had angiomyolipoma progression by the end of the follow - up period .
No patient underwent a nephrectomy for angiomyolipoma progression and one patient underwent renal embolization while treated with everolimus tablets .
14 . 5 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC ) - Associated Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma ( SEGA ) EXIST - 1 A randomized ( 2 : 1 ) , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( EXIST - 1 , NCT00789828 ) of everolimus tablets was conducted in 117 pediatric and adult patients with SEGA and TSC .
Eligible patients had at least one SEGA lesion ≥ 1 cm in longest diameter on MRI based on local radiology assessment and one or more of the following : serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth , a new SEGA lesion ≥ 1 cm in longest diameter , or new or worsening hydrocephalus .
Patients randomized to the treatment arm received everolimus tablets at a starting dose of 4 . 5 mg / m2 daily , with subsequent dose adjustments as needed to achieve and maintain everolimus trough concentrations of 5 to 15 ng / mL as tolerated .
Everolimus tablets or matched placebo continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline , 12 , 24 , and 48 weeks , and annually thereafter .
The main efficacy outcome measure was SEGA response rate based on independent central radiology review .
SEGA response was defined as a ≥ 50 % reduction in the sum of SEGA volume relative to baseline , in the absence of unequivocal worsening of non - target SEGA lesions , a new SEGA lesion ≥ 1 cm , and new or worsening hydrocephalus .
The primary analysis of SEGA response rate was limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized .

The median age was 9 . 5 years ( 0 . 8 to 26 years ) ; a total of 20 patients were < 3 years , 54 patients were 3 to < 12 years , 27 patients were 12 to < 18 years , and 16 patients were ≥ 18 years ; 57 % were male , and 93 % were White .
At baseline , 18 % of patients were receiving EIAEDs .
Based on central radiology review at baseline , 98 % of patients had at least one SEGA lesion ≥ 1 . 0 cm in longest diameter , 79 % had bilateral SEGAs , 43 % had ≥ 2 target SEGA lesions , 26 % had growth in or into the inferior surface of the ventricle , 9 % had evidence of growth beyond the subependymal tissue adjacent to the ventricle , and 7 % had radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus .
The median values for the sum of all target SEGA lesions at baseline were 1 . 63 cm3 ( 0 . 18 to 25 . 15 cm3 ) and 1 . 30 cm3 ( 0 . 32 to 9 . 75 cm3 ) in the everolimus tablets and placebo arms , respectively .
Eight ( 7 % ) patients had prior SEGA - related surgery .
The median duration of follow - up was 8 . 4 months ( 4 . 6 to 17 . 2 months ) at the time of primary analysis .
The SEGA response rate was statistically significantly higher in everolimus tablets - treated patients ( Table 25 ) .
At the time of the primary analysis , all SEGA responses were ongoing and the median duration of response was 5 . 3 months ( 2 . 1 to 8 . 4 months ) .
With a median follow - up of 8 . 4 months , SEGA progression was detected in 15 . 4 % of the 39 patients randomized to receive placebo and none of the 78 patients randomized to receive everolimus tablets .
No patient in either treatment arm required surgical intervention .

After the primary analysis , patients treated with everolimus tablets underwent additional follow - up MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow - up after the last patient was randomized .
A total of 111 patients ( 78 patients randomized to everolimus tablets and 33 patients randomized to placebo ) received at least one dose of everolimus tablets .
Median duration of everolimus tablets treatment and follow - up was 3 . 9 years ( 0 . 2 to 4 . 9 years ) .
By four years after the last patient was enrolled , 58 % of the 111 patients treated with everolimus tablets had a ≥ 50 % reduction in SEGA volume relative to baseline , including 27 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis and 37 patients with a SEGA response after the primary analysis .
The median time to SEGA response was 5 . 3 months ( 2 . 5 to 33 . 1 months ) .
Twelve percent of the 111 patients treated with everolimus tablets had documented disease progression by the end of the follow - up period and no patient required surgical intervention for SEGA during the study .
Study 2485 Study 2485 ( NCT00411619 ) was an open - label , single - arm trial conducted to evaluate the antitumor activity of everolimus tablets 3 mg / m2 / orally once daily in patients with SEGA and TSC .
Serial radiological evidence of SEGA growth was required for entry .
Tumor assessments were performed every 6 months for 60 months after the last patient was enrolled or disease progression , whichever occurred earlier .
The major efficacy outcome measure was the reduction in volume of the largest SEGA lesion with 6 months of treatment , as assessed via independent central radiology review .
Progression was defined as an increase in volume of the largest SEGA lesion over baseline that was ≥ 25 % over the nadir observed on study .
A total of 28 patients received everolimus tablets for a median duration of 5 . 7 years ( 5 months to 6 . 9 years ) ; 82 % of the 28 patients remained on everolimus tablets for at least 5 years .
The median age was 11 years ( 3 to 34 years ) , 61 % male , 86 % White .
At the primary analysis , 32 % of the 28 patients ( 95 % CI : 16 % , 52 % ) had an objective response at 6 months , defined as at least a 50 % decrease in volume of the largest SEGA lesion .
At the completion of the study , the median duration of durable response was 12 months ( 3 months to 6 . 3 years ) .
By 60 months after the last patient was enrolled , 11 % of the 28 patients had documented disease progression .
No patient developed a new SEGA lesion while on everolimus tablets .
Nine additional patients were identified as having a ≥ 50 % volumetric reduction in their largest SEGA lesion between 1 to 4 years after initiating everolimus tablets , including 3 patients who had surgical resection with subsequent regrowth prior to receiving everolimus tablets .
