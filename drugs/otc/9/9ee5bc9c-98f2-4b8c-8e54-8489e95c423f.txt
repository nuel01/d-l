4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None None .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions : Have cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment and personnel available and monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions ( 5 . 1 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following the administration of Tc 99 m exametazime injection and Tc 99 m exametazime labeled leukocytes including serious signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis following administration [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment and personnel available and monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions .
5 . 2 Risk for Image Interpretation Errors The interpretation of images for leukocyte labeled imaging can be affected by the presence of other pathophysiological processes such as : tumor , infarction , trauma , and inflammatory conditions .
5 . 3 Radiation Exposure Risk Technetium Tc 99 m contributes to a patient ' s overall long - term cumulative radiation exposure , which is associated with an increased risk of cancer .
Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure .
Encourage patients to drink fluids and instruct patients to void when the examination is completed and as often thereafter as frequently as possible after administration [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
Radiation risks associated with the use of Tc 99 m exametazime injection and Tc 99 m exametazime labeled leukocytes are greater in pediatric patients than in adults due to greater radiosensitivity and longer life expectancy .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The following adverse reactions associated with the use of Ceretec were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports .
Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiovascular disorders : Reversible increase in blood pressure , flushing Gastrointestinal disorders : Nausea , vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions : Malaise , fatigue , fever Immune system disorders : Hypersensitivity reactions : anaphylactic reactions including shock , facial edema , rash , pruritus or erythema Nervous system disorders : Headache , dizziness , paresthesia Most common adverse reactions include a reversible increase in blood pressure .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy - Advise the pregnant woman of the potential risk to the fetus based on the radiation dose from the Technetium Tc 99 m exametazime injection and the gestational timing of exposure .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation – Temporarily discontinue breastfeeding .
A lactating woman should pump and discard breastmilk for 12 to 24 hours after Technetium Tc 99 m Exametazime labeled leukocyte administration .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with technetium Tc 99 m exametazime use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform any drug associated risks for major birth defects and miscarriage .
Technetium Tc 99 m exametazime is transferred across the placenta [ see Data ] .
Animal reproduction studies with technetium Tc 99 m exametazime have not been conducted .
However , all radiopharmaceuticals have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose .
If considering technetium Tc 99 m exametazime administration to a pregnant woman , inform the patient about the potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes based on the radiation dose from technetium Tc 99 m exametazime and the gestational timing of exposure .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Limited published literature describes Tc 99 m exametazime crossing the placental barrier and visualization of radioactivity in the fetal liver .
No adverse fetal effects or radiation - related risks have been identified for diagnostic procedures involving less than 50 mGy , which represents less than 10 mGy fetal doses .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are limited data available in the scientific literature on the presence of technetium Tc 99 m exametazime in human milk .
There are no data available regarding the effects of technetium Tc 99 m exametazime on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
Exposure of technetium Tc 99 m exametazime to a breast fed infant can be minimized by temporary discontinuation of breastfeeding [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for Ceretec and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Ceretec or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations To decrease radiation exposure to the breastfed infant , advise a lactating woman to pump and discard breast milk after the administration of technetium Tc 99 m exametazime injection or technetium Tc 99 m exametazime - labeled leukocytes for 12 to 24 hours , where the duration corresponds to the typical range of administered activity , 259 MBq to 925 MBq ( 7 mCi to 25 mCi ) .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Ceretec is indicated for use in pediatric patients from 2 to 17 years of age for leukocyte labelled scintigraphy and brain scintigraphy .
The use of Ceretec for leukocyte labelled scintigraphy and brain scintigraphy is supported by extrapolation from clinical effectiveness in adults .
The safety and dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Ceretec did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and radiation exposure may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
A reduction in administered Tc 99 m can be considered provided an adequate number of leukocytes are administered .
11 DESCRIPTION 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics Ceretec ( kit for the preparation of technetium Tc 99 m exametazime injection ) prepares a radioactive diagnostic agent for intravenous use .
Each unit consists of the following : • One 10 mL vial of exametazime containing a sterile , non - pyrogenic , lyophilized mixture of 0 . 5 mg exametazime , 7 . 6 mcg stannous chloride dihydrate ( minimum stannous tin 0 . 6 mcg ; maximum total stannous and stannic tin 4 mcg per vial ) and 4 . 5 mg sodium chloride , sealed under nitrogen atmosphere with a rubber closure .
The product contains no antimicrobial preservative .
• One vial of cobalt stabilizer containing a sterile , non - pyrogenic solution of 200 mcg cobaltous chloride 6 - hydrate in 2 mL of Water for Injection .
The chemical name for Exametazime is [ ( RR , SS ) - 4 . 8 - diaza - 3 , 6 , 6 , 9 - tetramethylundecane - 2 , 10 - dione bisoxime ] .
The molecular formula of exametazime is C13H28N4O2 , with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Prior to publication of the USAN , exametazime was known as hexamethylpropylene amine oxime ( HM - PAO ) .
The name HM - PAO appears in many publications .
When sterile pyrogen - free sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m in isotonic saline is added to the vial of exametazime , a Tc 99 m complex of exametazime is formed .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Technetium Tc 99 m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half - life of 6 hours .
Photons that are useful for imaging studies are listed in Table 3 .

The first half - value thickness of lead ( Pb ) for technetium Tc 99 m is 0 . 25 mm .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 4 .
For example , the use of a 3 mm thickness of Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of approximately 1 , 000 .

This lipophilic complex is the active moiety and is able to cross the blood - brain barrier as well as penetrate cell membranes to label leukocytes .
It converts to a polar hydrophilic species at approximately 12 % per hour .
The polar hydrophilic species is unable to cross the blood - brain barrier or cell membranes .
Mechanism for Labeling Leukocytes When incubated with leukocytes , which have been isolated from whole blood , the technetium Tc 99 m exametazime complex , being lipid - soluble , penetrates the cell membrane of the leukocytes by passive diffusion .
The lipophilic complex is then converted to a polar hydrophilic species , in a process possibly involving intracellular glutathione , thus trapping the technetium Tc 99 m label within the cells .
Mechanism for Brain Uptake The agent localizes in the brain as a function of regional cerebral perfusion .
Technetium Tc 99 m exametazime is primarily extracted and trapped by cerebral gray matter and the basal ganglia during the first pass through the brain .
It has been proposed that the retention in the brain of technetium Tc 99 m exametazime results from in vivo conversion of the primary complex to a less lipophilic complex , which is unable to cross the blood - brain barrier .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The relationship between Tc 99 m exametazime plasma concentrations and successful imaging is not known .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Leukocytes Labeled with Tc 99 m Exametazime During the first hour following injection of Tc 99 m labeled leukocytes , activity is seen in the lungs , liver , spleen , blood pool , bone marrow , kidneys , gall bladder , and urinary bladder .
At 4 hours following injection , lung radioactivity was decreased and bone marrow radioactivity was increased .
The lipophilic Tc 99 m exametazime complex ( that is not stabilized by cobalt chloride ) is taken up by leukocytes and selectively retained in neutrophils .
Label elution rate is up to 10 % in the first hour .
Tc 99 m Exametazime Injection Studies in normal volunteers have shown that the technetium Tc 99 m exametazime is rapidly cleared from the blood after intravenous injection .
Uptake in the brain reaches a maximum of 3 . 5 to 7 % of the injected dose within one minute of injection .
Up to 15 % of the activity is eliminated from the brain by 2 minutes post injection , after which little activity is lost for the following 24 hours except by physical decay of technetium Tc 99 m .
Elimination Excretion Leukocytes Labeled with Tc 99 m Exametazime Following injection of Tc 99 m labeled leukocytes , over the first 1 to 6 hours , the Tc 99 m is visualized in the bowel .
At 24 hours post - injection substantial colonic activity is seen , implying that excretion of radioactivity takes place through bowel .
Tc 99 m Exametazime Injection About 30 % of the injected dose is found in the gastrointestinal tract immediately after injection and about 50 % of this is excreted through the intestinal tract over 48 hours .
About 40 % of the injected dose is excreted through the kidneys and urine over the 48 hours after injection .
The use of cobalt stabilizer solution for stabilization prior to injection does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetic handling or distribution of Tc 99 m exametazime .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Ceretec without cobalt stabilizer solution Long term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential or whether exametazime affects fertility in males or females .
When evaluated in the Ames test , exametazime increased the apparent rate of gene mutation in the TA100 strain of S . typhimurium .
Exametazime did not cause chromosomal aberrations in vitro ( Chinese Hamster Ovary cells ) or in vivo ( rat bone marrow ) .
Ceretec with cobalt stabilizer solution In - vitro mutagenicity studies indicate that the stabilized formulation of technetium - 99 m exametazime is weakly mutagenic in the Ames ( bacterial mutation ) test , human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay and mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase assay .
The stabilized formulation is not mutagenic in two in - vivo assays ( rat bone marrow micronucleus and rat liver micronucleus ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two clinical trials were performed in a total of 88 patients who had suspected intra - abdominal infection or inflammation .
Subjects received both Tc 99 m labeled leukocytes and a radiolabeled comparator .
Images were obtained at 2 and 30 minutes and at 2 and 4 hours and 24 hours .
In two other clinical trials , in a total of 127 patients with suspected abdominal inflammation or infection received Tc 99 m labeled leukocytes .
Imaging was at 24 hours in one study and at 1 , 3 and 24 hours in the other .
In all four studies images were blindly evaluated and the findings were confirmed by surgery , biopsy or other clinical data .
Based on the above 4 studies , between 2 to 4 hours Tc 99 m labeled leukocytes had 95 - 100 % sensitivity and 62 - 85 % specificity .
In all studies , the false positive and false negatives relate to the bowel background , the location of the site of infection / inflammation and whether or not it is contiguous with the bowel .
Images obtained at 24 hours can be unreliable because of a high bowel background ; false negatives were noted in both Tc 99 m and the radiolabeled comparator .
Other studies suggest that the interpretation of the images could be affected by the presence of tumors , infarction and peritonitis ; liver abscess may be missed because of the bowel background .
