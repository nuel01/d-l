Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) 3 / 2021 Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 , 5 . 7 ) 3 / 2021 Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 19 , 5 . 20 ) 9 / 2021 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE CONZIP is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily , around - the - clock , long term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate .
CONZIP is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily , around - the - clock , long - term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate .
( 1 ) Limitations of Use • Because of the risks of addiction , abuse , and misuse with opioids , even at recommended doses , and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended - release opioid formulations , reserve CONZIP for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options ( e . g . , non - opioid analgesics or immediate - release opioids ) are ineffective , not tolerated , or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain .
( 1 ) • CONZIP is not indicated as an as - needed ( prn ) analgesic .
( 1 ) Limitation of Use • Because of the risks of addiction , abuse , and misuse with opioids , even at recommended doses , and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended - release / long - acting opioid formulations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] , reserve CONZIP for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options ( e . g . , non - opioid analgesics or immediate - release opioids ) are ineffective , not tolerated , or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain .
• CONZIP is not indicated as an as - needed ( prn ) analgesic .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • To be prescribed only by healthcare providers knowledgeable in use of potent opioids for management of chronic pain .
( 2 . 1 ) • Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals .
( 2 . 1 ) • Individualize dosing based on the severity of pain , patient response , prior analgesic experience , and risk factors for addiction , abuse , and misuse .
( 2 . 1 ) • Do not exceed a daily dose of 300 mg tramadol .
Do not use with other tramadol products .
( 2 . 1 ) • Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient ' s need for access to naloxone , both when initiating and renewing treatment with CONZIP .
Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient ' s risk factors for overdose .
( 2 . 2 , 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 , 5 . 7 ) • For opioid - naïve and opioid non - tolerant patients : Initiate CONZIP at a dose of 100 mg once daily , then titrate up by 100 mg increments every 5 days according to need and tolerance .
( 2 . 3 ) • For patients currently on tramadol IR : Calculate total 24 - hr IR dose , and initiate CONZIP at a dose rounded down to next lower 100 mg increment ; then adjust dose according to need and tolerance .
See full prescribing information for instructions on conversion , titration , and maintenance of therapy .
( 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) • Do not abruptly discontinue CONZIP in a physically - dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms , uncontrolled pain , and suicide .
( 2 . 5 ) 2 . 1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions CONZIP should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain .
• Do not use CONZIP concomitantly with other tramadol products [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) , ( 5 . 14 ) ] .
• Do not administer CONZIP at a dose exceeding 300 mg per day .
• Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
• Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually , taking into account the patient ' s severity of pain , patient response , prior analgesic treatment experience , and risk factors for addiction , abuse , and misuse [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression , especially within the first 24 - 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with CONZIP and adjust the dosage accordingly [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Instruct patients to swallow CONZIP capsules whole [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] , and to take it with liquid .
Breaking , chewing , splitting , or dissolving CONZIP capsules will result in uncontrolled delivery of tramadol and can lead to overdose or death [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• CONZIP may be taken without regard to food .
It is recommended that CONZIP be taken in a consistent manner [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone , both when initiating and renewing treatment with CONZIP [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines ( e . g . , by prescription , directly from a pharmacist , or as part of community - based program ) .
Consider prescribing naloxone , based on the patient ' s risk factors for overdose , such as concomitant use of CNS depressants , a history of opioid use disorder , or prior opioid overdose .
The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 , 5 . 7 ) ] .
Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members ( including children ) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose .
2 . 3 Initial Dosage Patients Not Currently on a Tramadol Product The initial dose of CONZIP is 100 mg once daily .
Patients Currently on Tramadol Immediate - Release ( IR ) Products Calculate the 24 - hour tramadol IR dose and initiate a total daily dose of CONZIP rounded down to the next lowest 100 mg increment .
The dose may subsequently be individualized according to patient need .
Due to limitations in flexibility of dose selection with CONZIP , some patients maintained on tramadol IR products may not be able to convert to CONZIP .
Conversion from Other Opioids to CONZIP Discontinue all other around - the - clock opioid drugs when CONZIP therapy is initiated .
There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to CONZIP defined by clinical trials .
Initiate dosing using CONZIP 100 mg once a day .
2 . 4 Titration and Maintenance Therapy Individually titrate CONZIP by 100 mg every five days to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions .
The maximum daily dose of CONZIP is 300 mg per day .
Continually reevaluate patients receiving CONZIP to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions , as well as monitoring for the development of addiction , abuse , or misuse [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Frequent communication is important among the prescriber , other members of the healthcare team , the patient , and the caregiver / family during periods of changing analgesic requirements , including initial titration .
During chronic therapy , periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics .
Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage adjustment of CONZIP , or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate - release analgesic .
If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization , attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the CONZIP dosage .
If unacceptable opioid - related adverse reactions are observed , consider reducing the dosage .
Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid - related adverse reactions .
2 . 5 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of CONZIP Do not abruptly discontinue CONZIP in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids .
Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms , uncontrolled pain , and suicide .
Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics , which may be confused with drug - seeking for abuse .
Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids , such as heroin , and other substances .
When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid - dependent patient taking CONZIP , there are a variety of factors that should be considered , including the dose of CONZIP the patient has been taking , the duration of treatment , the type of pain being treated , and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient .
It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow - up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic .
When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder , evaluate and treat the patient , or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder .
Treatment should include evidence - based approaches , such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder .
Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist .
There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients .
Good clinical practice dictates a patient - specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually .
For patients on CONZIP who are physically opioid - dependent , initiate the taper by a small enough increment ( e . g . , no greater than 10 % to 25 % of the total daily dose ) to avoid withdrawal symptoms , and proceed with dose - lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks .
Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper .
It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper .
Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms , should they emerge .
Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness , lacrimation , rhinorrhea , yawning , perspiration , chills , myalgia , and mydriasis .
Other signs and symptoms also may develop , including irritability , anxiety , backache , joint pain , weakness , abdominal cramps , insomnia , nausea , anorexia , vomiting , diarrhea , or increased blood pressure , respiratory rate , or heart rate .
If withdrawal symptoms arise , it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose , and then proceed with a slower taper .
In addition , monitor patients for any changes in mood , emergence of suicidal thoughts , or use of other substances .
When managing patients taking opioid analgesics , particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and / or with high doses for chronic pain , ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management , including mental health support ( if needed ) , is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper .
A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain , as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 17 ) , Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 . 3 ) ] .

( 5 . 8 ) • Risk of Seizure : Present within recommended dose range .
Risk is increased with higher than recommended doses and concomitant use of SSRIs , SNRIs , anorectics , tricyclic antidepressants and other tricyclic compounds , other opioids , MAOIs , neuroleptics , other drugs that reduce seizure threshold , in patients with epilepsy or at risk for seizures .
( 5 . 9 , 7 ) • Risk of Suicide : Do not use CONZIP in suicidal or addiction - prone patients .
Use with caution in those taking tranquilizers , antidepressants or abuse alcohol .
( 5 . 10 ) • Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed , treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids , and wean patient off of the opioid .
( 5 . 11 ) • Life - Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly , Cachectic , or Debilitated Patients : Monitor closely , particularly during initiation and titration .
( 5 . 12 ) • Severe Hypotension : Monitor during dosage initiation and titration .
Avoid use of CONZIP in patients with circulatory shock .
( 5 . 13 ) • Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure , Brain Tumors , Head Injury , or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression .
Avoid use of CONZIP in patients with impaired consciousness or coma .
( 5 . 14 ) 5 . 1 Addiction , Abuse and Misuse CONZIP contains tramadol , a Schedule IV controlled substance .
As an opioid , CONZIP exposes users to the risks of addiction , abuse and misuse .
Because extended - release products such as CONZIP deliver the opioid over an extended period of time , there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of tramadol present [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) ] .
Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown , it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed CONZIP .
Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused .
Assess each patient ' s risk for opioid addiction , abuse or misuse prior to prescribing CONZIP , and monitor all patients receiving CONZIP for the development of these behaviors and conditions .
Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse ( including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction ) or mental illness ( e . g . , major depression ) .
The potential for these risks should not , however , prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient .
Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as CONZIP , but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of CONZIP along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction , abuse and misuse .
Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Abuse or misuse of CONZIP by splitting , breaking , chewing , crushing , snorting , or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of tramadol and can result in overdose and death [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion .
Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing CONZIP .
Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product .
5 . 2 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction , abuse , and misuse , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) for these products .
Under the requirements of the REMS , drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS - compliant education programs available to healthcare providers .
Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following : • Complete a REMS - compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education ( CE ) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Healthcare Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain .
• Discuss the safe use , serious risks , and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and / or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed .
The Patient Counseling Guide ( PCG ) can be obtained at this link : www . fda . gov / OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG .
• Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them .
• Consider using other tools to improve patient , household , and community safety , such as patient - prescriber agreements that reinforce patient - prescriber responsibilities .
To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME / CE , call 1 - 800 - 503 - 0784 , or log on to www . opioidanalgesicrems . com .
The FDA Blueprint can be found at www . fda . gov / OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint .
5 . 3 Life - Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious , life - threatening , or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids , even when used as recommended .
Respiratory depression , if not immediately recognized and treated , may lead to respiratory arrest and death .
Management of respiratory depression may include close observation , supportive measures , and use of opioid antagonists , depending on the patient ' s clinical status [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) retention from opioid - induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids .
While serious , life - threatening , or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of CONZIP , the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase .
Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression , especially within the first 24 - 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of CONZIP .
To reduce the risk of respiratory depression , proper dosing and titration of CONZIP are essential [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Overestimating the CONZIP dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose .
Accidental ingestion of even one dose of CONZIP , especially by children , can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of tramadol .
Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Opioids can cause sleep - related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea ( CSA ) and sleep - related hypoxemia .
Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose - dependent fashion .
In patients who present with CSA , consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone , both when initiating and renewing treatment with CONZIP .
Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines ( e . g . , by prescription , directly from a pharmacist , or as part of a community - based program ) .
Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help , even if naloxone is administered [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Consider prescribing naloxone , based on the patient ' s risk factors for overdose , such as concomitant use of CNS depressants , a history of opioid use disorder , or prior opioid overdose .
The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient .
Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members ( including children ) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose .
If naloxone is prescribed , educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 7 ) , Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 4 Ultra - Rapid Metabolism of Tramadol and Other Risk Factors for Life - Threatening Respiratory Depression in Children Life - threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol .
Tramadol and codeine are subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype ( described below ) , which can lead to increased exposure to an active metabolite .
Based upon postmarketing reports with tramadol or with codeine , children younger than 12 years of age may be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol .
Furthermore , children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with opioids for post - tonsillectomy and / or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to their respiratory depressant effect .
Because of the risk of life - threatening respiratory depression and death : • CONZIP is contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
• CONZIP is contraindicated for post - operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and / or adenoidectomy [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
• Avoid the use of CONZIP in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol unless the benefits outweigh the risks .
Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation , such as postoperative status , obstructive sleep apnea , obesity , severe pulmonary disease , neuromuscular disease , and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression .
• As with adults , when prescribing opioids for adolescents , healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of opioid overdose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) , Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
Nursing Mothers Tramadol is subject to the same polymorphic metabolism as codeine , with ultra - rapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates being potentially exposed to life - threatening levels of O - desmethyltramadol ( M1 ) .
At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because the mother was an ultra - rapid metabolizer of codeine .
A baby nursing from an ultra - rapid metabolizer mother taking CONZIP could potentially be exposed to high levels of M1 , and experience life - threatening respiratory depression .
For this reason , breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with CONZIP [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 2 ) ] .
CYP2D6 Genetic Variability : Ultra - rapid metabolizer Some individuals may be ultra - rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype ( gene duplications denoted as * 1 / * 1 × N or * 1 / * 2 × N ) .
The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 1 to 10 % for Whites ( European , North American ) , 3 to 4 % for Blacks ( African Americans ) , 1 to 2 % for East Asians ( Chinese , Japanese , Korean ) , and may be greater than 10 % in certain racial / ethnic groups ( i . e . , Oceanian , Northern African , Middle Eastern , Ashkenazi Jews , Puerto Rican ) .
These individuals convert tramadol into its active metabolite , O - desmethyltramadol ( M1 ) , more rapidly and completely than other people .
This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum M1 levels .
Even at labeled dosage regimens , individuals who are ultra - rapid metabolizers may have life - threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose ( such as extreme sleepiness , confusion , or shallow breathing ) [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
Therefore , individuals who are ultra - rapid metabolizers should not use CONZIP .
5 . 5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of CONZIP during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate .
Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome , unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults , may be life - threatening if not recognized and treated , and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts .
Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly .
Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 6 Risks of Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers , 3A4 inhibitors , or 2D6 inhibitors on levels of tramadol and M1 from CONZIP are complex .
Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers , 3A4 inhibitors , or 2D6 inhibitors with CONZIP requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug , tramadol which is a weak serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and mu - opioid agonist , and the active metabolite , M1 , which is more potent than tramadol in mu - opioid receptor binding [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 2D6 Inhibitors The concomitant use of CONZIP with all cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors ( e . g . , amiodarone , quinidine ) may result in an increase in tramadol plasma levels and a decrease in the levels of the active metabolite , M1 .
A decrease in M1 exposure in patients who have developed physical dependence to tramadol , may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and reduced efficacy .
The effect of increased tramadol levels may be an increased risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome .
Discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor may result in a decrease in tramadol plasma levels and an increase in active metabolite M1 levels , which could increase or prolong adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression .
Follow patients receiving CONZIP and any CYP2D6 inhibitor for the risk of serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome , signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity , and opioid withdrawal when CONZIP is used in conjunction with inhibitors of CYP2D6 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction The concomitant use of CONZIP with cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors , such as macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , erythromycin ) , azole - antifungal agents ( e . g . , ketoconazole ) , and protease inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir ) or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer such as rifampin , carbamazepine , and phenytoin , may result in an increase in tramadol plasma concentrations , which could increase or prolong adverse reactions , increase the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome , and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression .
The concomitant use of CONZIP with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor may result in lower tramadol levels .
This may be associated with a decrease in efficacy , and in some patients , may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal .
Follow patients receiving CONZIP and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer for the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome , signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal when CONZIP is used in conjunction with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 7 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation , respiratory depression , coma , and death may result from the concomitant use of CONZIP with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants ( e . g . , non - benzodiazepine sedatives / hypnotics , anxiolytics , tranquilizers , muscle relaxants , general anesthetics , antipsychotics , other opioids , alcohol ) .
Because of these risks , reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate .
Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug - related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone .
Because of similar pharmacological properties , it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic , prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use .
In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic , prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid , and titrate based on clinical response .
If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant , prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic , and titrate based on clinical response .
Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation .
If concomitant use is warranted , consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when CONZIP is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants ( including alcohol and illicit drugs ) .
Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressants have been determined .
Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders , including opioid abuse and misuse , and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 8 Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs Cases of serotonin syndrome , a potentially life - threatening condition , have been reported with the use of tramadol , including CONZIP , particularly during concomitant use with serotonergic drugs .
Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) , tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) , triptans , 5 - HT3 receptor antagonists , drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system ( e . g . , mirtazapine , trazodone , tramadol ) , certain muscle relaxants ( i . e . , cyclobenzaprine , metaxalone ) , and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin ( including MAO inhibitors , both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others , such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
This may occur within the recommended dosage range .
Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes ( e . g . , agitation , hallucinations , coma ) , autonomic instability ( e . g . , tachycardia , labile blood pressure , hyperthermia ) , neuromuscular aberrations ( e . g . , hyperreflexia , incoordination , rigidity ) , and / or gastrointestinal symptoms ( e . g . , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ) .
The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use , but may occur later than that .
Discontinue CONZIP if serotonin syndrome is suspected .
5 . 9 Increased Risk of Seizures Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range .
Spontaneous post - marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range .
Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking : [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] • Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and serotonin - norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) antidepressants or anorectics , • Tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) , and other tricyclic compounds ( e . g . , cyclobenzaprine , promethazine , etc . ) , • Other opioids , • MAO inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] , • Neuroleptics , or • Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold .
Risk of seizures may also increase in patients with epilepsy , those with a history of seizures , or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure ( such as head trauma , metabolic disorders , alcohol and drug withdrawal , CNS infections ) .
In tramadol overdose , naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure .
5 . 10 Suicide Risk • Do not prescribe CONZIP for patients who are suicidal or addiction - prone .
Consideration should be given to the use of non - narcotic analgesics in patients who are suicidal or depressed [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 . 2 ) ] .
• Prescribe CONZIP with caution for patients with a history of misuse and / or are currently taking CNS - active drugs including tranquilizers or antidepressant drugs , or alcohol in excess , and patients who suffer from emotional disturbance or depression [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
• Inform patients not to exceed the recommended dose and to limit their intake of alcohol [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
5 . 11 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use , more often following greater than one month of use .
Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non - specific symptoms and signs including nausea , vomiting , anorexia , fatigue , weakness , dizziness , and low blood pressure .
If adrenal insufficiency is suspected , confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible .
If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed , treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids .
Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers .
Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency .
The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency .
5 . 12 Life - Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly , Cachectic , or Debilitated Patients The use of CONZIP in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated .
Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : CONZIP treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale , and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve , hypoxia , hypercapnia , or pre - existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea , even at recommended dosages of CONZIP [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Elderly , Cachectic , or Debilitated Patients : Life - threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly , cachectic , or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger , healthier patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Monitor such patients closely , particularly when initiating and titrating CONZIP and when CONZIP is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
Alternatively , consider the use of non - opioid analgesics in these patients .
5 . 13 Severe Hypotension CONZIP may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients .
There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs ( e . g . , phenothiazines or general anesthetics ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of CONZIP .
In patients with circulatory shock , CONZIP may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure .
Avoid the use of CONZIP in patients with circulatory shock .
5 . 14 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure , Brain Tumors , Head Injury , or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention ( e . g . , those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors ) , CONZIP may reduce respiratory drive , and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure .
Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression , particularly when initiating therapy with CONZIP .
Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury .
Avoid the use of CONZIP in patients with impaired consciousness or coma .
5 . 15 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions CONZIP is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction , including paralytic ileus .
The tramadol in CONZIP may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi .
Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase .
Monitor patients with biliary tract disease , including acute pancreatitis , for worsening symptoms .
5 . 16 Anaphylaxis and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and rarely fatal hypersensitive reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol .
When these events do occur , it is often following the first dose .
Other reported hypersensitivity reactions include pruritus , hives , bronchospasm , angioedema , toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens - Johnson syndrome .
Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tramadol and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive CONZIP .
If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity occurs , stop administration of CONZIP immediately , discontinue CONZIP permanently , and do not rechallenge with any formulation of tramadol .
Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 17 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue CONZIP in a patient physically dependent on opioids .
When discontinuing CONZIP in a physically dependent patient , gradually taper the dosage .
Rapid tapering of tramadol in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 . 3 ) ] .
Additionally , avoid the use of mixed agonist / antagonist ( e . g . , pentazocine , nalbuphine , and butorphanol ) or partial agonist ( e . g . , buprenorphine ) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic , including CONZIP .
In these patients , mixed agonist / antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and / or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
When discontinuing CONZIP , gradually taper the dosage [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Do not abruptly discontinue CONZIP [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 18 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery CONZIP may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery .
Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of CONZIP and know how they will react to the medication [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 19 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia ( serum sodium < 135 mmol / L ) has been reported with the use of tramadol , and many cases are severe ( sodium level < 120 mmol / L ) .
Most cases of hyponatremia occurred in females over the age of 65 and within the first week of therapy .
In some reports , hyponatremia resulted from the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( SIADH ) .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia ( e . g . , confusion , disorientation ) , during treatment with CONZIP , especially during initiation of therapy .
If signs and symptoms of hyponatremia are present , initiate appropriate treatment ( e . g . , fluid restriction ) and discontinue CONZIP [ see Dosage and Administration : Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of CONZIP ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
5 . 20 Hypoglycemia Cases of tramadol - associated hypoglycemia have been reported , some resulting in hospitalization .
In most cases , patients had predisposing risk factors ( e . g . , diabetes ) .
If hypoglycemia is suspected , monitor blood glucose levels and consider drug discontinuation as appropriate [ see Dosage and Administration : Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of CONZIP ( 2 . 5 ) ] .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
CONZIP capsules were administered to a total of 1987 patients in clinical trials .
These included four double - blind and one long - term , open - label study in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and knee .
A total of 812 patients were 65 years or older .
Adverse reactions with doses from 100 mg to 300 mg in the four pooled , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies in patients with chronic non - malignant pain are presented in the following table ( see Table 1 ) .
Table 1 : Incidence ( % ) of Patients with Adverse Reaction Rates ≥ 5 % from Four Double - Blind , Placebo - Controlled Studies in Patients with Moderate to Moderately Severe Chronic Pain by Dose ( N = 1917 ) Preferred Term CONZIP Placebo 100 mg ( N = 429 ) n ( % ) 200 mg ( N = 434 ) n ( % ) 300 mg ( N = 1054 ) n ( % ) ( N = 646 ) n ( % ) Headache 99 ( 23 . 1 ) 96 ( 22 . 1 ) 200 ( 19 . 0 ) 128 ( 19 . 8 ) Nausea 69 ( 16 . 1 ) 93 ( 21 . 4 ) 265 ( 25 . 1 ) 37 ( 5 . 7 ) Somnolence 50 ( 11 . 7 ) 60 ( 13 . 8 ) 170 ( 16 . 1 ) 26 ( 4 . 0 ) Dizziness 41 ( 9 . 6 ) 54 ( 12 . 4 ) 143 ( 13 . 6 ) 31 ( 4 . 8 ) Constipation 40 ( 9 . 3 ) 59 ( 13 . 6 ) 225 ( 21 . 3 ) 27 ( 4 . 2 ) Vomiting 28 ( 6 . 5 ) 45 ( 10 . 4 ) 98 ( 9 . 3 ) 12 ( 1 . 9 ) Arthralgia 23 ( 5 . 4 ) 20 ( 4 . 6 ) 53 ( 5 . 0 ) 33 ( 5 . 1 ) Dry Mouth 20 ( 4 . 7 ) 36 ( 8 . 3 ) 138 ( 13 . 1 ) 22 ( 3 . 4 ) Sweating 18 ( 4 . 2 ) 23 ( 5 . 3 ) 71 ( 6 . 7 ) 4 ( 0 . 6 ) Asthenia 15 ( 3 . 5 ) 26 ( 6 . 0 ) 91 ( 8 . 6 ) 17 ( 2 . 6 ) Pruritus 13 ( 3 . 0 ) 25 ( 5 . 8 ) 77 ( 7 . 3 ) 12 ( 1 . 9 ) Anorexia 9 ( 2 . 1 ) 23 ( 5 . 3 ) 60 ( 5 . 7 ) 1 ( 0 . 2 ) Insomnia 9 ( 2 . 1 ) 9 ( 2 . 1 ) 53 ( 5 . 0 ) 11 ( 1 . 7 ) The following adverse reactions were reported from all chronic pain studies ( N = 1917 ) .
The lists below include adverse reactions not otherwise noted in Table 1 .
Adverse reactions with incidence rates of 1 . 0 % to < 5 . 0 % Cardiac disorders : hypertension Gastrointestinal disorders : dyspepsia , flatulence General disorders : abdominal pain , accidental injury , chills , fever , flu syndrome , neck pain , pelvic pain Investigations : hyperglycemia , urine abnormality Metabolism and nutrition disorders : peripheral edema , weight loss Musculoskeletal , connective tissue and bone disorders : myalgia Nervous system disorders : paresthesia , tremor , withdrawal syndrome Psychiatric disorders : agitation , anxiety , apathy , confusion , depersonalization , depression , euphoria , nervousness Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : bronchitis , pharyngitis , rhinitis , sinusitis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : rash Urogenital disorders : prostatic disorder , urinary tract infection Vascular disorders : vasodilatation Adverse reactions with incidence rates of 0 . 5 % to < 1 . 0 % at any dose and serious adverse reactions reported in at least two patients Cardiac disorders : EKG abnormal , hypotension , tachycardia Gastrointestinal disorders : gastroenteritis General disorders : neck rigidity , viral infection Hematologic / Lymphatic disorders : anemia , ecchymoses Metabolism and nutrition disorders : blood urea nitrogen increased , GGT increased , gout , SGPT increased Musculoskeletal disorders : arthritis , arthrosis , joint disorder , leg cramps Nervous system disorders : emotional lability , hyperkinesia , hypertonia , thinking abnormal , twitching , vertigo Respiratory disorders : pneumonia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : hair disorder , skin disorder , urticaria Special Senses : eye disorder , lacrimation disorder Urogenital disorders : cystitis , dysuria , sexual function abnormality , urinary retention 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tramadol .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome , a potentially life - threatening condition , have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs .
Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use , more often following greater than one month of use .
Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in CONZIP .
Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
QT prolongation / torsade de pointes : Cases of QT prolongation and / or torsade de pointes have been reported with tramadol use .
Many of these cases were reported in patients taking another drug labeled for QT prolongation , in patients with a risk factor for QT prolongation ( e . g . , hypokalemia ) , or in overdose setting .
Metabolism and nutrition disorders Hyponatremia : Cases of severe hyponatremia and / or SIADH have been reported in patients taking tramadol , most often in females over the age of 65 , and within the first week of therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 19 ) ] .
Hypoglycemia : Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking tramadol .
Most reports were in patients with predisposing risk factors , including diabetes or renal insufficiency , or in elderly patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 20 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 2 includes clinically significant drug interactions with CONZIP .
Table 2 : Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with CONZIPInhibitors of CYP2D6 Clinical Impact : The concomitant use of CONZIP and CYP2D6 inhibitors may result in an increase in the plasma concentration of tramadol and a decrease in the plasma concentration of M1 , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of CONZIP is achieved .
Since M1 is a more potent mu - opioid agonist , decreased M1 exposure could result in decreased therapeutic effects , and may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal in patients who had developed physical dependence to tramadol .
Increased tramadol exposure can result in increased or prolonged therapeutic effects and increased risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome .
After stopping a CYP2D6 inhibitor , as the effects of the inhibitor decline , the tramadol plasma concentration will decrease and the M1 plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong therapeutic effects but also increase adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity , and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention : If concomitant use of a CYP2D6 inhibitor is necessary , follow patients closely for adverse reactions including opioid withdrawal , seizures , and serotonin syndrome .
If a CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued , consider lowering CONZIP dosage until stable drug effects are achieved .
Follow patients closely for adverse events including respiratory depression and sedation .
Examples : Quinidine , fluoxetine , paroxetine and bupropion Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Clinical Impact : The concomitant use of CONZIP and CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of tramadol and may result in a greater amount of metabolism via CYP2D6 and greater levels of M1 .
Follow patients closely for increased risk of serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome , and adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity including potentially fatal respiratory depression , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of CONZIP is achieved .
After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor , as the effects of the inhibitor decline , the tramadol plasma concentration will decrease [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , resulting in decreased opioid efficacy and possibly signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal in patients who had developed physical dependence to tramadol .
Intervention : If concomitant use is necessary , consider dosage reduction of CONZIP until stable drug effects are achieved .
Follow patients closely for seizures and serotonin syndrome , and signs of respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals .
If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued , consider increasing the CONZIP dosage until stable drug effects are achieved and follow patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal .
Examples : Macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , erythromycin ) , azole - antifungal agents ( e . g . , ketoconazole ) , protease inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir ) CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact : The concomitant use of CONZIP and CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of tramadol , [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to tramadol , [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer , as the effects of the inducer decline , the tramadol plasma concentration will increase [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions , and may cause seizures and serotonin syndrome , and potentially fatal respiratory depression .
Intervention : If concomitant use is necessary , consider increasing the CONZIP dosage until stable drug effects are achieved .
Follow patients for signs of opioid withdrawal .
If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued , consider CONZIP dosage reduction and monitor for seizures and serotonin syndrome , and signs of sedation and respiratory depression .
Patients taking carbamazepine , a CYP3A4 inducer , may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol .
Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol , concomitant administration of CONZIP and carbamazepine is not recommended .
Examples : Rifampin , carbamazepine , phenytoin Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Depressants Clinical Impact : Due to additive pharmacologic effect , the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants , including alcohol , can increase the risk of hypotension , respiratory depression , profound sedation , coma , and death .
Intervention : Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate .
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required .
Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation .
If concomitant use is warranted , consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 , 5 . 7 ) ] .
Examples : Benzodiazepines and other sedatives / hypnotics , anxiolytics , tranquilizers , muscle relaxants , general anesthetics , antipsychotics , other opioids , alcohol Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact : The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome .
Intervention : If concomitant use is warranted , carefully observe the patient , particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment .
Discontinue CONZIP if serotonin syndrome is suspected .
Examples : Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) , tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) , triptans , 5 - HT3 receptor antagonists , drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system ( e . g . , mirtazapine , trazodone , tramadol ) , certain muscle relaxants ( i . e . , cyclobenzaprine , metaxalone ) , monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors ( those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others , such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue ) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ( MAOIs ) Clinical Impact : MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] or opioid toxicity ( e . g . , respiratory depression , coma ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention : Do not use CONZIP in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment .
Examples : Phenelzine , tranylcypromine , linezolid Mixed Agonist / Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact : May reduce the analgesic effect of CONZIP and / or precipitate withdrawal symptoms .
Intervention : Avoid concomitant use .
Examples : Butorphanol , nalbuphine , pentazocine , buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact : Tramadol may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression .
Intervention : Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of CONZIP and / or the muscle relaxant as necessary .
Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids , consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 , 5 . 7 ) ] .
Diuretics Clinical Impact : Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone .
Intervention : Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and / or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed .
Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact : The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and / or severe constipation , which may lead to paralytic ileus .
Intervention : Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when CONZIP is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs .
Digoxin Clinical Impact : Post - marketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity .
Intervention : Follow patients for signs of digoxin toxicity and adjust dosage of digoxin as needed .
Warfarin Clinical Impact : Post - marketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of alteration of warfarin effect , including elevation of prothrombin times .
Intervention : Monitor the prothrombin time of patients on warfarin for signs of an interaction and adjust the dosage of warfarin as needed .
Mixed Agonist / Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics : Avoid use with CONZIP because they may reduce analgesic effect of CONZIP or precipitate withdrawal symptoms .
( 5 . 17 , 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended .
( 8 . 2 ) • Severe Hepatic or Renal Impairment : Use not recommended .
( 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Available data with CONZIP in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug - associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage .
In animal reproduction studies , tramadol administration during organogenesis decreased fetal weights and reduced ossification in mice , rats , and rabbits at 1 . 4 , 0 . 6 , and 3 . 6 times the maximum recommended human daily dosage ( MRHD ) .
Tramadol decreased pup body weight and increased pup mortality at 1 . 2 and 1 . 9 times the MRHD [ see Data ] .
Based on animal data , advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth .
Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability , hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern , high pitched cry , tremor , vomiting , diarrhea , and failure to gain weight .
The onset , duration , and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used , duration of use , timing and amount of last maternal use , and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn .
Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Neonatal seizures , neonatal withdrawal syndrome , fetal death and still birth have been reported with tramadol during post - approval use of tramadol immediate - release products .
Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho - physiologic effects in neonates .
An opioid antagonist , such as naloxone , must be available for reversal of opioid - induced respiratory depression in the neonate .
CONZIP is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor , when use of shorter - acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate .
Opioid analgesics , including CONZIP can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength , duration , and frequency of uterine contractions .
However , this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation , which tends to shorten labor .
Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression .
Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta .
The mean ratio of serum tramadol in the umbilical veins compared to maternal veins was 0 . 83 for 40 women given tramadol during labor .
The effect of CONZIP , if any , on the later growth , development , and functional maturation of the child is unknown .
Data Animal Data Tramadol has been shown to be embryotoxic and fetotoxic in mice , ( 120 mg / kg ) , rats ( 25 mg / kg ) and rabbits ( 75 mg / kg ) at maternally toxic dosages , but was not teratogenic at these dose levels .
These doses on a mg / m2 basis are 1 . 9 , 0 . 8 , and 4 . 9 times the maximum recommended human daily dosage ( MRHD ) for mouse , rat and rabbit , respectively .
No drug - related teratogenic effects were observed in progeny of mice ( up to 140 mg / kg ) , rats ( up to 80 mg / kg ) or rabbits ( up to 300 mg / kg ) treated with tramadol by various routes .
Embryo and fetal toxicity consisted primarily of decreased fetal weights , decreased skeletal ossification , and increased supernumerary ribs at maternally toxic dose levels .
Transient delays in developmental or behavioral parameters were also seen in pups from rat dams allowed to deliver .
Embryo and fetal lethality were reported only in one rabbit study at 300 mg / kg , a dose that would cause extreme maternal toxicity in the rabbit .
The dosages listed for mouse , rat , and rabbit are 2 . 3 , 2 . 6 , and 19 times the MRHD , respectively .
Tramadol was evaluated in pre - and post - natal studies in rats .
Progeny of dams receiving oral ( gavage ) dose levels of 50 mg / kg ( 1 . 6 times the MRHD ) or greater had decreased weights , and pup survival was decreased early in lactation at 80 mg / kg ( 2 . 6 times the MRHD ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary CONZIP is not recommended for obstetrical preoperative medication or for post - delivery analgesia in nursing mothers because its safety in infants and newborns has not been studied .
Tramadol and its metabolite , O - desmethyltramadol ( M1 ) , are present in human milk .
There is no information on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production .
The M1 metabolite is more potent than tramadol in mu - opioid receptor binding [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Published studies have reported tramadol and M1 in colostrum with administration of tramadol to nursing mothers in the early post - partum period .
Women who are ultra - rapid metabolizers of tramadol may have higher than expected serum levels of M1 , potentially leading to higher levels of M1 in breast milk that can be dangerous in their breastfed infants .
In women with normal tramadol metabolism , the amount of tramadol secreted into human milk is low and dose - dependent .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions , including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with CONZIP .
Clinical Considerations If infants are exposed to CONZIP through breast milk , they should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression .
Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped , or when breast - feeding is stopped .
Data Following a single IV 100 mg dose of tramadol , the cumulative excretion in breast milk within 16 hours post dose was 100 mcg of tramadol ( 0 . 1 % of the maternal dose ) and 27 mcg of M1 .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential .
It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CONZIP in pediatric patients have not been established .
Life - threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
In some of the reported cases , these events followed tonsillectomy and / or adenoidectomy , and one of the children had evidence of being an ultra - rapid metabolizer of tramadol ( i . e . , multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 ) .
Children with sleep apnea may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol .
Because of the risk of life - threatening respiratory depression and death : • CONZIP is contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
• CONZIP is contraindicated for post - operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and / or adenoidectomy [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
• Avoid the use of CONZIP in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol unless the benefits outweigh the risks .
Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation , such as postoperative status , obstructive sleep apnea , obesity , severe pulmonary disease , neuromuscular disease , and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Eight hundred and twelve elderly ( 65 years of age or older ) subjects were exposed to CONZIP in clinical trials .
Of those subjects , two hundred and forty were 75 years of age and older .
In general , higher incidence rates of adverse events were observed for patients older than 65 years of age compared with patients 65 years and younger , particularly for the following adverse events : nausea , constipation , somnolence , dizziness , dry mouth , vomiting , asthenia , pruritus , anorexia , sweating , fatigue , weakness , postural hypotension and dyspepsia .
For this reason , CONZIP should be used with great caution in patients older than 75 years of age [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids , and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid - tolerant or when opioids were co - administered with other agents that depress respiration .
Titrate the dosage of CONZIP slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Tramadol is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver .
CONZIP has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment .
The limited availability of dose strengths of CONZIP does not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) .
Therefore , CONZIP should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment CONZIP has not been studied in patients with renal impairment .
Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite , M1 .
The limited availability of dose strengths of CONZIP does not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with severe renal impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) .
Therefore , CONZIP should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance CONZIP contains tramadol , a Schedule IV controlled substance .
9 . 2 Abuse CONZIP contains tramadol , a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids , and can be abused and is subject to misuse , addiction , and criminal diversion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The high drug content in extended - release formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse .
All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction , because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use .
Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non - therapeutic use of a prescription drug , even once , for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects .
Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral , cognitive , and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes : a strong desire to take the drug , difficulties in controlling its use , persisting in its use despite harmful consequences , a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations , increased tolerance , and sometimes a physical withdrawal .
" Drug - seeking " behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders .
Drug - seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours , refusal to undergo appropriate examination , testing , or referral , repeated " loss " of prescriptions , tampering with prescriptions , and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare providers .
" Doctor shopping " ( visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions ) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction .
Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control .
Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance .
Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts .
In addition , abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction .
CONZIP , like other opioids , can be diverted for non - medical use into illicit channels of distribution .
Careful record - keeping of prescribing information , including quantity , frequency , and renewal requests , as required by state and federal law , is strongly advised .
Proper assessment of the patient , proper prescribing practices , periodic re - evaluation of therapy , and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs .
Risks Specific to Abuse of CONZIP CONZIP is for oral use only .
The abuse of CONZIP poses a risk of overdose and death .
The risk is increased with concurrent use of CONZIP with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants .
With intravenous abuse , the inactive ingredients in CONZIP can result in local tissue necrosis , infection , pulmonary granulomas , embolism and death , and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury .
Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV .
9 . 3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy .
Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia ( in the absence of disease progression or other external factors ) .
Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs , and may develop at different rates for different effects .
Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure , resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug .
Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity ( e . g . , naloxone , nalmefene ) , mixed agonist / antagonist analgesics ( e . g . , pentazocine , butorphanol , nalbuphine ) , or partial agonists ( e . g . , buprenorphine ) .
Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage .
Do not abruptly discontinue CONZIP in a patient physically dependent on opioids .
Rapid tapering of CONZIP in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms , uncontrolled pain , and suicide .
Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics , which may be confused with drug - seeking for abuse .
When discontinuing CONZIP , gradually taper the dosage using a patient - specific plan that considers the following : the dose of CONZIP the patient has been taking , the duration of treatment , and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient .
To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms , it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient .
In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses , ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management , including mental health support ( if needed ) , is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 17 ) ] .
Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdosage with CONZIP can be manifested by respiratory depression , somnolence progressing to stupor or coma , skeletal muscle flaccidity , cold and clammy skin , constricted pupils , and , in some cases , pulmonary edema , bradycardia , QT prolongation , hypotension , partial or complete airway obstruction , atypical snoring , and death .
Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Treatment of Overdose In case of overdosage , priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation , if needed .
Employ other supportive measures ( including oxygen and vasopressors ) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated .
Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life - support techniques .
Opioid antagonists , such as naloxone , are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose .
For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose , administer an opioid antagonist .
While naloxone will reverse some , but not all , symptoms caused by overdosage with tramadol , the risk of seizures is also increased with naloxone administration .
In animals , convulsions following the administration of toxic doses of CONZIP could be suppressed with barbiturates or benzodiazepines but were increased with naloxone .
Naloxone administration did not change the lethality of an overdose in mice .
Hemodialysis is not expected to be helpful in an overdose because it removes less than 7 % of the administered dose in a 4 - hour dialysis period .
Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of tramadol in CONZIP , carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished .
CONZIP will continue to release tramadol and add to the tramadol load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion , necessitating prolonged monitoring .
If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature , administer additional antagonist as directed by the product ' s prescribing information .
In an individual physically dependent on opioids , administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome .
The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered .
If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient , administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist .
11 DESCRIPTION CONZIP ( tramadol hydrochloride ) is an opioid agonist in an extended - release oral formulation .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action CONZIP contains tramadol , an opioid agonist , and an inhibitor of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin .
Although its mode of action is not completely understood , from animal tests , at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable : binding of parent and M1 metabolite to mu - opioid receptors and weak inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin .
Opioid activity of tramadol is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O - demethylated metabolite M1 to mu - opioid receptors .
In animal models , M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in mu - opioid binding .
Tramadol - induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by the opioid antagonist naloxone in several animal tests .
The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound .
Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro , as have some other opioid analgesics .
These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol .
The relationship between exposure of tramadol and M1 and efficacy has not been evaluated in clinical studies .
Apart from analgesia , tramadol administration may produce a constellation of symptoms ( including dizziness , somnolence , nausea , constipation , sweating and pruritus ) similar to that of other opioids .
In contrast to morphine , tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release .
At therapeutic doses , tramadol has no effect on heart rate , left ventricular function or cardiac index .
Orthostatic hypotension has been observed .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Central Nervous System Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers .
The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation .
Tramadol causes miosis , even in total darkness .
Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic ( e . g . , pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings ) .
Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations .
Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Tramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum .
Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased .
Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased , while tone is increased to the point of spasm , resulting in constipation .
Other opioid - induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions , spasm of sphincter of Oddi , and transient elevations in serum amylase .
Effects on the Cardiovascular System Tramadol produces peripheral vasodilation , which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope .
Manifestations of histamine release and / or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus , flushing , red eyes , sweating , and / or orthostatic hypotension .
The effect of oral tramadol on the QTcF interval was evaluated in a double - blind , randomized , four - way crossover , placebo - and positive - ( moxifloxacin ) controlled study in 68 adult male and female healthy subjects .
At a 600 mg / day dose ( 1 . 5 - fold the maximum immediate - release daily dose ) , the study demonstrated no significant effect on the QTcF interval .
Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , cortisol , and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) in humans [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
They also stimulate prolactin , growth hormone ( GH ) secretion , and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon .
Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic - pituitary - gonadal axis , leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido , impotence , erectile dysfunction , amenorrhea , or infertility .
The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical , physical , lifestyle , and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models .
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown .
Overall , the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive .
Concentration – Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients , especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids .
The minimum effective analgesic concentration of tramadol for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain , the development of a new pain syndrome , and / or the development of analgesic tolerance [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 4 ) ] .
Concentration – Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing tramadol plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose - related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea , vomiting , CNS effects , and respiratory depression .
In opioid - tolerant patients , the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid - related adverse reactions [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The analgesic activity of tramadol is due to both parent drug and the M1 metabolite .
CONZIP is administered as a racemate and both tramadol and M1 are detected in the circulation .
The Cmax and AUC of CONZIP capsules have been observed to be dose - proportional over an oral dose range of 100 to 300 mg in healthy subjects .
Absorption After a single dose administration of CONZIP , Tmax occurs around 10 - 12 hours .
The mean Cmax and AUC of CONZIP capsules after a 300 mg single dose was 308 ng / mL and 6777 ng . hr / mL , respectively under fasting conditions .
CONZIP is bioequivalent to a reference extended - release tramadol product following a single 300 mg dose under fasting conditions .
At steady - state , CONZIP at 200 mg has been observed to be bioequivalent to a reference extended - release tramadol product at 200 mg under fasting conditions ( Table 3 ) .
Following administration of CONZIP 200 mg capsules , steady - state plasma concentrations of both tramadol and M1 are achieved within four days of once daily dosing .
Table 3 Mean ( % CV ) Steady - State Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values ( N = 38 ) Tramadol O - Desmethyltramadol ( M1 Metabolite ) Parameter Tramadol hydrochloride Extended - Release Capsules 200 mg A Reference Extended - Release Tramadol Product 200 mg Tramadol hydrochloride Extended - Release Capsules 200 mg A Reference Extended - Release Tramadol Product 200 mg AUC0 - 24 : Area Under the Curve in a 24 - hour dosing interval Cmax : Peak Concentration in a 24 - hour dosing interval Cmin : Trough Concentration in a 24 - hour dosing interval Tmax : Time to Peak Concentration AUC0 - 24 ( ng . hr / mL ) 5678 ( 27 % ) 5563 ( 32 % ) 1319 ( 34 % ) 1302 ( 40 % ) Cmax ( ng / mL ) 332 ( 25 % ) 350 ( 31 % ) 70 ( 34 % ) 74 ( 41 % ) Cmin ( ng / mL ) 128 ( 39 % ) 125 ( 45 % ) 35 ( 34 % ) 33 ( 42 % ) Tmax 5 . 9 ( 66 % ) 10 ( 30 % ) 11 ( 37 % ) 13 ( 29 % ) % Fluctuation 88 ( 19 % ) 101 ( 30 % ) 64 ( 22 % ) 76 ( 30 % ) Food Effect The rate and extent of absorption of CONZIP capsules ( 300 mg ) are similar following oral administration with or without food .
Therefore , CONZIP capsules can be administered without regard to meals .
Distribution The volume of distribution of tramadol was 2 . 6 and 2 . 9 liters / kg in male and female subjects , respectively , following a 100 mg intravenous tramadol dose .
The binding of tramadol to human plasma proteins is approximately 20 % and binding also appears to be independent of concentration up to 10 mcg / mL .
Saturation of plasma protein binding occurs only at concentrations outside the clinically relevant range .
Elimination Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism by the liver and the metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys .
The mean plasma elimination half - lives of racemic tramadol and racemic M1 after administration of CONZIP capsules are approximately 10 and 11 hours , respectively .
Metabolism Tramadol is extensively metabolized after oral administration .
The major metabolic pathways appear to be N - ( mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 ) and O - ( mediated by CYP2D6 ) demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in the liver .
One metabolite ( O - desmethyltramadol , denoted M1 ) is pharmacologically active in animal models .
Formation of M1 is dependent on CYP2D6 and as such is subject to inhibition and polymorphism , which may affect the therapeutic response [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Excretion Approximately 30 % of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug , whereas 60 % of the dose is excreted as metabolites .
The remainder is excreted either as unidentified or as unextractable metabolites .
Special Populations Hepatic Impairment Pharmacokinetics of tramadol was studied in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment after receiving multiple doses of an extended - release tramadol product at 100 mg .
The exposure of ( + ) - and ( - ) - tramadol was similar in mild and moderate hepatic impairment patients in comparison to patients with normal hepatic function .
However , exposure of ( + ) - and ( - ) - M1 decreased ~ 50 % with increased severity of the hepatic impairment ( from normal to mild and moderate ) .
The pharmacokinetics of tramadol has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
After the administration of tramadol immediate - release tablets to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver , tramadol area under the plasma concentration time curve was larger and the tramadol and M1 half - lives were longer than subjects with normal hepatic function .
The limited availability of dose strengths of CONZIP does not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
Therefore , CONZIP should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Renal Impairment Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite , M1 .
The pharmacokinetics of tramadol was studied in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment after receiving multiple doses of an extended - release tramadol product at 100 mg .
There is no consistent trend observed for tramadol exposure related to renal function in patients with mild ( CLcr : 50 - 80 mL / min ) or moderate ( CLcr : 30 - 50 mL / min ) renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function ( CLcr > 80 mL / min ) .
However , exposure of M1 increased 20 - 40 % with increased severity of the renal impairment ( from normal to mild and moderate ) .
The pharmacokinetics of tramadol has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) .
The limited availability of dose strengths of CONZIP does not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with severe renal impairment .
Therefore , CONZIP should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment .
The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4 - hour dialysis period is less than 7 % of the administered dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Sex Based on pooled multiple - dose pharmacokinetics studies for an extended - release tramadol product in 166 healthy subjects ( 111 males and 55 females ) , the dose - normalized AUC values for tramadol were somewhat higher in females than in males .
There was a considerable degree of overlap in values between male and female groups .
Dosage adjustment based on sex is not recommended .
Age : Geriatric Population The effect of age on pharmacokinetics of CONZIP has not been studied .
Healthy elderly subjects aged 65 to 75 years administered an immediate - release formulation of tramadol , have plasma concentrations and elimination half - lives comparable to those observed in healthy subjects younger than 65 years of age .
In subjects over 75 years , mean maximum plasma concentrations are elevated ( 208 vs . 162 ng / mL ) and the mean elimination half - life is prolonged ( 7 vs . 6 hours ) compared to subjects 65 to 75 years of age .
Adjustment of the daily dose is recommended for patients older than 75 years [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Potential for Tramadol to Affect Other Drugs In vitro studies indicate that tramadol is unlikely to inhibit the CYP3A4 - mediated metabolism of other drugs when tramadol is administered concomitantly at therapeutic doses .
Tramadol does not appear to induce its own metabolism in humans , since observed maximal plasma concentrations after multiple oral doses are higher than expected based on single - dose data .
Poor / Extensive Metabolizers , CYP2D6 The formation of the active metabolite , M1 , is mediated by CYP2D6 , a polymorphic enzyme .
Approximately 7 % of the population has reduced activity of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme of cytochrome P - 450 metabolizing enzyme system .
These individuals are " poor metabolizers " of debrisoquine , dextromethorphan and tricyclic antidepressants , among other drugs .
Based on a population PK analysis of Phase 1 studies with IR tablets in healthy subjects , concentrations of tramadol were approximately 20 % higher in " poor metabolizers " versus " extensive metabolizers " , while M1 concentrations were 40 % lower .
CYP2D6 Inhibitors In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine , paroxetine , and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol .
Quinidine Tramadol is metabolized to active metabolite M1 by CYP2D6 .
Coadministration of quinidine , a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6 , with tramadol ER resulted in a 50 - 60 % increase in tramadol exposure and a 50 - 60 % decrease in M1 exposure .
The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown .
To evaluate the effect of tramadol , a CYP2D6 substrate on quinidine , an in vitro drug interaction study in human liver microsomes was conducted .
The results from this study indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 6 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since tramadol is also metabolized by CYP3A4 , administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors , such as ketoconazole and erythromycin , or CYP3A4 inducers , such as rifampin and St . John ' s Wort , with CONZIP may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to altered tramadol exposure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 6 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Cimetidine Concomitant administration of tramadol immediate - release tablets with cimetidine , a weak CPY3A4 inhibitor , does not result in clinically significant changes in tramadol pharmacokinetics .
No alteration of the CONZIP dosage regimen with cimetidine is recommended .
Carbamazepine Carbamazepine , a CYP3A4 inducer , increases tramadol metabolism .
Patients taking carbamazepine may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol .
Concomitant administration of CONZIP and carbamazepine is not recommended .
13 NON - CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity assessment has been conducted in mice , rats and p53 ( + / - ) heterozygous mice .
A slight but statistically significant increase in two common murine tumors , pulmonary and hepatic , was observed in an NMRI mouse carcinogenicity study , particularly in aged mice .
Mice were dosed orally up to 30 mg / kg in the drinking water ( 0 . 5 times the maximum recommended daily human dosage or MRHD ) for approximately two years , although the study was not done with the Maximum Tolerated Dose .
This finding is not believed to suggest risk in humans .
No evidence of carcinogenicity was noted in a rat 2 - year carcinogenicity study testing oral doses of up to 30 mg / kg in the drinking water ( 1 times the MRHD ) .
In a second rat study , no evidence of carcinogenicity was noted in rats at oral doses up to 75 mg / kg / day for males and 100 mg / kg / day for females ( approximately 2 fold the maximum recommended human daily dose MRHD ) for two years .
However , the excessive decrease in body weight gain observed in the rat study might have reduced their sensitivity to any potential carcinogenic effect of the drug .
No carcinogenic effect of tramadol was observed in p53 ( + / – ) - heterozygous mice at oral doses up to 150 mg / kg / day for 26 weeks .
Mutagenesis Tramadol was mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in the mouse lymphoma assay .
Tramadol was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay using Salmonella and E . coli ( Ames ) , the mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of metabolic activation , the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay , or the in vivo micronucleus assay in bone marrow .
Impairment of Fertility No effects on fertility were observed for tramadol at oral dose levels up to 50 mg / kg in male rats and 75 mg / kg in female rats .
These dosages are 1 . 2 and 1 . 8 times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area , respectively .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES CONZIP is bioequivalent under fasting conditions to another extended - release tramadol product [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] which demonstrated efficacy in two of four clinical trials of patients with chronic pain .
To qualify for inclusion into these studies , patients were required to have moderate to moderately severe pain as defined by a pain intensity score of ≥ 40 mm , off previous medications , on a 0 - 100 mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) .
In one 12 - week randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , patients with moderate to moderately severe pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee and / or hip were administered doses from 100 mg to 400 mg daily .
Treatment with the extended - release tramadol product was initiated at 100 mg once daily for four days then increased by 100 mg per day increments every five days to the randomized fixed dose .
Between 51 % and 59 % of patients in active treatment groups completed the study and 56 % of patients in the placebo group completed the study .
Discontinuations due to adverse events were more common in the extended - release tramadol product 200 mg , 300 mg and 400 mg treatment groups ( 20 % , 27 % , and 30 % of discontinuations , respectively ) compared to 14 % of the patients treated with the extended - release tramadol product 100 mg and 10 % of patients treated with placebo .
Pain , as assessed by the WOMAC Pain subscale , was measured at 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 weeks and change from baseline assessed .
A responder analysis based on the percent change in WOMAC Pain subscale demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pain for the 100 mg and 200 mg treatment groups compared to placebo ( see Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 [ MULTIMEDIA ] In one 12 - week randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled flexible - dosing trial of the extended - release tramadol product in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee , patients titrated to an average daily dose of approximately 270 mg / day .
Forty - nine percent of patients randomized to the active treatment group completed the study , while 52 % of patients randomized to placebo completed the study .
Most of the early discontinuations in the active treatment group were due to adverse events , accounting for 27 % of the early discontinuations in contrast to 7 % of the discontinuations from the placebo group .
Thirty - seven percent of the placebo - treated patients discontinued the study due to lack of efficacy compared to 15 % of active - treated patients .
The active treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the mean Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) score , and a statistically significant difference in the responder rate , based on the percent change from baseline in the VAS score , measured at 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks , between patients receiving the extended - release tramadol product and placebo ( see Figure 3 ) .
Figure 3 [ MULTIMEDIA ] Four randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trials of CONZIP were conducted , none of which demonstrated efficacy but which differed in design from the preceding clinical studies described .
Two trials were 12 - week randomized placebo - controlled trials of CONZIP 100 mg / day , 200 mg / day , and 300 mg / day versus placebo in patients with moderate to moderately severe osteoarthritis pain of the hip and knee .
The other two 12 week trials were similar in design , but only studied CONZIP 300 mg / day .
In this fixed - dose design , subjects were required to titrate to a fixed dose , even if their pain responded to a lower titration dose .
