8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Do not breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal data with irinotecan HCl and the mechanism of action of ONIVYDE , ONIVYDE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data in pregnant women .
Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity were observed following treatment with irinotecan HCl , at doses resulting in irinotecan exposures lower than those achieved with ONIVYDE 70 mg / m2 in humans , administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis [ see Data ] .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of irinotecan liposome on reproduction and fetal development ; however , studies have been conducted with irinotecan HCl .
Irinotecan crosses the placenta of rats following intravenous administration .
Intravenous administration of irinotecan at a dose of 6 mg / kg / day to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased post - implantation loss and decreased numbers of live fetuses .
In separate studies in rats , this dose resulted in an irinotecan exposure of approximately 0 . 002 times the exposure of irinotecan based on area under the curve ( AUC ) in patients administered ONIVYDE at the 70 mg / m2 dose .
Administration of irinotecan HCl resulted in structural abnormalities and growth delays in rats at doses greater than 1 . 2 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 0002 times the clinical exposure to irinotecan in ONIVYDE based on AUC ) .
Teratogenic effects included a variety of external , visceral , and skeletal abnormalities .
Irinotecan HCl administered to rat dams for the period following organogenesis through weaning at doses of 6 mg / kg / day caused decreased learning ability and decreased female body weights in the offspring .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of irinotecan liposome , irinotecan , or SN - 38 ( an active metabolite of irinotecan ) in human milk , or the effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
Irinotecan is present in rat milk [ see Data ] .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from ONIVYDE , advise a nursing woman not to breastfeed during treatment with ONIVYDE and for one month after the final dose .
Data Radioactivity appeared in rat milk within 5 minutes of intravenous administration of radiolabeled irinotecan HCl and was concentrated up to 65 - fold at 4 hours after administration relative to plasma concentrations .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females ONIVYDE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ONIVYDE and for one month after the final dose .
Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with ONIVYDE and for four months after the final dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ONIVYDE have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 264 patients who received ONIVYDE as a single agent or in combination with 5 - FU and leucovorin in Study 1 , 49 % were ≥ 65 years old and 13 % were ≥ 75 years old .
No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE There are no treatment interventions known to be effective for management of overdosage of ONIVYDE .
11 DESCRIPTION ONIVYDE is formulated with irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate , a topoisomerase inhibitor , into a liposomal dispersion for intravenous use .
The chemical name of irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate is ( S ) - 4 , 11 - diethyl - 3 , 4 , 12 , 14 - tetrahydro - 4 - hydroxy - 3 , 14 - dioxo1H - pyrano [ 3 ' , 4 ' : 6 , 7 ] - indolizino [ 1 , 2 - b ] quinolin - 9 - yl - [ 1 , 4 ' bipiperidine ] - 1 ' - carboxylate , monohydrochloride , trihydrate .
The empirical formula is C33H38N4O6 ∙ HCl ∙ 3H2O and the molecular weight is 677 . 19 g / mole .
The molecular structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] ONIVYDE is a sterile , white to slightly yellow opaque isotonic liposomal dispersion .
Each 10 mL single - dose vial contains 43 mg irinotecan free base at a concentration of 4 . 3 mg / mL .
The liposome is a unilamellar lipid bilayer vesicle , approximately 110 nm in diameter , which encapsulates an aqueous space containing irinotecan in a gelated or precipitated state as the sucrose octasulfate salt .
The vesicle is composed of 1 , 2 - distearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DSPC ) 6 . 81 mg / mL , cholesterol 2 . 22 mg / mL , and methoxy - terminated polyethylene glycol ( MW 2000 ) - distearoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine ( MPEG - 2000 - DSPE ) 0 . 12 mg / mL .
Each mL also contains 2 - [ 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) piperazin - 1 - yl ] ethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) as a buffer 4 . 05 mg / mL and sodium chloride as an isotonicity reagent 8 . 42 mg / mL .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Irinotecan liposome injection is a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor encapsulated in a lipid bilayer vesicle or liposome .
Topoisomerase 1 relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing single - strand breaks .
Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN - 38 bind reversibly to the topoisomerase 1 - DNA complex and prevent re - ligation of the single - strand breaks , leading to exposure time - dependent double - strand DNA damage and cell death .
In mice bearing human tumor xenografts , irinotecan liposome administered at irinotecan HCl - equivalent doses 5 - fold lower than irinotecan HCl achieved similar intratumoral exposure of SN - 38 .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The plasma pharmacokinetics of total irinotecan and total SN - 38 were evaluated in patients with cancer who received ONIVYDE , as a single agent or as part of combination chemotherapy , at doses between 50 and 155 mg / m2 and 353 patients with cancer using population pharmacokinetic analysis .
The pharmacokinetic parameters of total irinotecan and total SN - 38 following the administration of ONIVYDE 70 mg / m2 as a single agent or part of combination chemotherapy are presented in Table 4 .
Table 4 : Summary of Mean ( ± Standard Deviation ) Total Irinotecan and Total SN - 38 Dose ( mg / m2 ) Total Irinotecan Total SN - 38 Cmax [ µg / mL ] ( n = 25 ) AUC0 - ∞ [ h ∙ µg / mL ] ( n = 23 ) t1 / 2 [ h ] ( n = 23 ) CL [ L / h ] ( n = 23 ) Vd [ L ] ( n = 23 ) Cmax [ ng / mL ] ( n = 25 ) AUC0 - ∞ [ h ∙ ng / mL ] ( n = 13 ) t1 / 2 [ h ] ( n = 13 ) Cmax : Maximum plasma concentration AUC0 - ∞ : Area under the plasma concentration curve extrapolated to time infinity t ½ : Terminal elimination half - life CL : Clearance Vd : Volume of distribution 70 37 . 2 ( 8 . 8 ) 1364 ( 1048 ) 25 . 8 ( 15 . 7 ) 0 . 20 ( 0 . 17 ) 4 . 1 ( 1 . 5 ) 5 . 4 ( 3 . 4 ) 620 ( 329 ) 67 . 8 ( 44 . 5 ) Over the dose range of 50 to 155 mg / m2 , the Cmax and AUC of total irinotecan increases with dose .
Additionally , the Cmax of total SN - 38 increases proportionally with dose ; however , the AUC of total SN - 38 increases less than proportionally with dose .
Distribution Direct measurement of irinotecan liposome showed that 95 % of irinotecan remains liposome - encapsulated , and the ratios between total and encapsulated forms did not change with time from 0 to 169 . 5 hours post - dose .
The mean volume of distribution is summarized in Table 4 .
Plasma protein binding is < 0 . 44 % of the total irinotecan in ONIVYDE .
Elimination Metabolism The metabolism of irinotecan liposome has not been evaluated .
Irinotecan is subject to extensive metabolic conversion by various enzyme systems , including esterases to form the active metabolite SN - 38 , and UGT1A1 mediating glucuronidation of SN - 38 to form the inactive glucuronide metabolite SN - 38 G .
Irinotecan can also undergo CYP3A4 - mediated oxidative metabolism to several inactive oxidation products , one of which can be hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase to release SN - 38 .
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis using the results of a subset with UGT1A1 * 28 genotypic testing , in which the analysis adjusted for the lower dose administered to patients homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele , patients homozygous ( N = 14 ) and non - homozygous ( N = 244 ) for this allele had total SN - 38 average steady - state concentrations of 1 . 06 and 0 . 95 ng / mL , respectively .
Excretion The disposition of ONIVYDE has not been elucidated in humans .
Following administration of irinotecan HCl , the urinary excretion of irinotecan is 11 to 20 % ; SN - 38 , < 1 % ; and SN - 38 glucuronide , 3 % .
The cumulative biliary and urinary excretion of irinotecan and its metabolites ( SN - 38 and SN - 38 glucuronide ) , over a period of 48 hours following administration of irinotecan HCl in two patients , ranged from approximately 25 % ( 100 mg / m2 ) to 50 % ( 300 mg / m2 ) .
Specific Populations Age , Gender , and Renal Impairment : The population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that age ( 28 to 87 years ) had no clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of irinotecan and SN - 38 .
The population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that gender ( 196 males and 157 females ) had no clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of irinotecan and SN - 38 after adjusting for body surface area ( BSA ) .
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis , mild - to - moderate renal impairment had no effect on the exposure of total SN - 38 after adjusting for BSA .
The analysis included 68 patients with moderate ( CLcr 30 - 59 mL / min ) renal impairment , 147 patients with mild ( CLcr 60 - 89 mL / min ) renal impairment , and 135 patients with normal renal function ( CLcr > 90 mL / min ) .
There was insufficient data in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) to assess its effect on pharmacokinetics .
Ethnicity : The population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that Asians ( East Asians , N = 150 ) have 56 % lower total irinotecan average steady state concentration and 8 % higher total SN - 38 average steady state concentration than Whites ( N = 182 ) .
Hepatic Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan liposome have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment .
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis , patients with baseline bilirubin concentrations of 1 - 2 mg / dL ( N = 19 ) had average steady state concentrations for total SN - 38 that were increased by 37 % compared to patients with baseline bilirubin concentrations of < 1 mg / dL ( N = 329 ) ; however , there was no effect of elevated ALT / AST concentrations on total SN - 38 concentrations .
No data are available in patients with bilirubin > 2 mg / dL .
Drug Interactions In a population pharmacokinetic analysis , the pharmacokinetics of total irinotecan and total SN - 38 were not altered by the co - administration of fluorouracil / leucovorin .
Following administration of irinotecan HCl , dexamethasone , a moderate CYP3A4 inducer , does not alter the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan .
In vitro studies indicate that irinotecan , SN - 38 and another metabolite , aminopentane carboxylic acid ( APC ) , do not inhibit cytochrome P - 450 isozymes .
12 . 5 Pharmacogenomics Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia from irinotecan HCl .
In Study 1 , patients homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele ( N = 7 ) initiated ONIVYDE at a reduced dose of 50 mg / m2 in combination with 5 - FU / LV .
The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in these patients [ 2 of 7 ( 28 . 6 % ) ] was similar to the frequency in patients not homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele who received a starting dose of ONIVYDE of 70 mg / m2 [ 30 of 110 ( 27 . 3 % ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No studies have been performed to assess the potential of irinotecan liposome for carcinogenicity , genotoxicity or impairment of fertility .
Intravenous administration of irinotecan hydrochloride to rats once weekly for 13 weeks followed by a 91 - week recovery period resulted in a significant linear trend between irinotecan HCl dosage and the incidence of combined uterine horn endometrial stromal polyps and endometrial stromal sarcomas .
Irinotecan HCl was clastogenic both in vitro ( chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells ) and in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) .
Neither irinotecan nor its active metabolite , SN - 38 , was mutagenic in the in vitro Ames assay .
Dedicated fertility studies have not been performed with irinotecan liposome injection .
Atrophy of male and female reproductive organs was observed in dogs receiving irinotecan liposome injection every 3 weeks at doses equal to or greater than 15 mg / kg , ( approximately 3 times the clinical exposure of irinotecan following administration to ONIVYDE dosed at 70 mg / m2 ) for a total of 6 doses .
No significant adverse effects on fertility and general reproductive performance were observed after intravenous administration of irinotecan HCl in doses of up to 6 mg / kg / day to rats ; however , atrophy of male reproductive organs was observed after multiple daily irinotecan HCl doses both in rodents at 20 mg / kg ( approximately 0 . 007 times the clinical irinotecan exposure following ONIVYDE administration at 70 mg / m2 ) and in dogs at 0 . 4 mg / kg ( 0 . 0007 times the clinical exposure to irinotecan following administration of ONIVYDE ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of ONIVYDE was evaluated in Study 1 , a three - arm , randomized , open - label trial in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with documented disease progression , after gemcitabine or gemcitabine - based therapy .
Key eligibility criteria included Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 70 , serum bilirubin within institution limits of normal , and albumin ≥ 3 . 0 g / dL .
Patients were randomized to receive ONIVYDE plus fluorouracil / leucovorin ( ONIVYDE / 5 - FU / LV ) , ONIVYDE , or fluorouracil / leucovorin ( 5 - FU / LV ) .
Randomization was stratified by ethnicity ( White vs . East Asian vs . other ) , KPS ( 70 - 80 vs . 90 - 100 ) , and baseline albumin level ( ≥ 4 g / dL vs . 3 . 0 - 3 . 9 g / dL ) .
Patients randomized to ONIVYDE / 5 - FU / LV received ONIVYDE 70 mg / m2 as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes , followed by leucovorin 400 mg / m2 intravenously over 30 minutes , followed by fluorouracil 2400 mg / m2 intravenously over 46 hours , every 2 weeks .
The ONIVYDE dose of 70 mg / m2 is based on irinotecan free base ( equivalent to 80 mg / m2 of irinotecan as the hydrochloride trihydrate ) .
Patients randomized to ONIVYDE as a single agent received ONIVYDE 100 mg / m2 as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes every 3 weeks .
Patients randomized to 5 - FU / LV received leucovorin 200 mg / m2 intravenously over 30 minutes , followed by fluorouracil 2000 mg / m2 intravenously over 24 hours , administered on Days 1 , 8 , 15 and 22 of a 6 - week cycle .
Patients homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele initiated ONIVYDE at a reduced dose ( 50 mg / m2 ONIVYDE , if given with 5 - FU / LV or 70 mg / m2 ONIVYDE as a single agent ) .
When ONIVYDE was withheld or discontinued for adverse reactions , 5 - FU was also withheld or discontinued .
When the dose of ONIVYDE was reduced for adverse reactions , the dose of 5 - FU was reduced by 25 % .
Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival ( OS ) with two pair - wise comparisons : ONIVYDE versus 5 - FU / LV and ONIVYDE / 5 - FU / LV versus 5 - FU / LV .
Additional efficacy outcome measures were progression - free survival ( PFS ) and objective response rate ( ORR ) .
Tumor status assessments were conducted at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter .
The trial was initiated as a two - arm study and amended after initiation to include a third arm ( ONIVYDE / 5 - FU / LV ) .
The comparisons between the ONIVYDE / 5 - FU / LV and the 5 - FU / LV arms are limited to patients enrolled in the 5 - FU / LV arm after this protocol amendment .
Four hundred seventeen patients were randomized to : ONIVYDE / 5 - FU / LV ( N = 117 ) , ONIVYDE ( N = 151 ) , or 5 - FU / LV ( N = 149 ) .
Baseline demographics and tumor characteristics for the 236 patients randomized to ONIVYDE / 5 - FU / LV or 5 - FU / LV ( N = 119 ) after the addition of the third arm to the study were a median age of 63 years ( range 34 - 81 years ) and with 41 % ≥ 65 years of age ; 58 % were men ; 63 % were White , 30 % were Asian , 3 % were Black or African American , and 5 % were other .
Mean baseline albumin level was 3 . 97 g / dL , and baseline KPS was 90 - 100 in 53 % of patients .
Disease characteristics included liver metastasis ( 67 % ) and lung metastasis ( 31 % ) .
A total of 13 % of patients received gemcitabine in the neoadjuvant / adjuvant setting only , 55 % of patients had 1 prior line of therapy for metastatic disease , and 33 % of patients had 2 or more prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease .
All patients received prior gemcitabine ( alone or in combination with another agent ) , 54 % received prior gemcitabine in combination with another agent , and 13 % received prior gemcitabine in combination with nab - paclitaxel .
Study 1 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for the ONIVYDE / 5 - FU / LV arm over the 5 - FU / LV arm as summarized in Table 5 and Figure 1 .
There was no improvement in overall survival for the ONIVYDE arm over the 5 - FU / LV arm ( hazard ratio = 1 . 00 , p - value = 0 . 97 ( two - sided log - rank test ) ) .
