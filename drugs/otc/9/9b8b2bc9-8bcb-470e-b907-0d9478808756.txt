Patients can then be increased to the maximum effective dose of 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours dose .
For patients with severe AD , 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours is the effective dose .
Doses higher than 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours confer no appreciable additional benefit , and are associated with an increase in the incidence of adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Mild - to - Moderate Alzheimer ' s Disease and Mild - to - Moderate Parkinson ' s Disease Dementia The effective dosage of Rivastigmine Transdermal System is 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours or 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours administered once per day ; replace with a new patch every 24 hours .
Severe Alzheimer ' s Disease The effective dosage of Rivastigmine Transdermal System in patients with severe Alzheimer ' s disease is 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours administered once per day ; replace with a new patch every 24 hours .
Interruption of Treatment If dosing is interrupted for 3 days or fewer , restart treatment with the same or lower strength Rivastigmine Transdermal System .
If dosing is interrupted for more than 3 days , restart treatment with the 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System and titrate as described above .
2 . 2 Dosing in Specific Populations Dosing Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Consider using the 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System as both the initial and maintenance dose in patients with mild ( Child - Pugh score 5 to 6 ) to moderate ( Child - Pugh score 7 to 9 ) hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Dosing Modifications in Patients with Low Body Weight Carefully titrate and monitor patients with low body weight ( less than 50 kg ) for toxicities ( e . g . , excessive nausea , vomiting ) and consider reducing the maintenance dose to the 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System if such toxicities develop .
2 . 3 Switching to Rivastigmine Transdermal System from Rivastigmine Capsules or Rivastigmine Oral Solution Patients treated with Rivastigmine capsules or oral solution may be switched to Rivastigmine Transdermal System as follows : • A patient who is on a total daily dose of less than 6 mg of oral rivastigmine can be switched to the 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System .
• A patient who is on a total daily dose of 6 mg to 12 mg of oral rivastigmine can be switched to the 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System .
Instruct patients or caregivers to apply the first patch on the day following the last oral dose .
2 . 4 Important Administration Instructions Rivastigmine Transdermal System is for transdermal use on intact skin .
( a ) Do not use the patch if the pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut , damaged , or changed in any way .
( b ) Apply the Rivastigmine Transdermal System once a day • Press down firmly for 30 seconds until the edges stick well when applying to clean , dry , hairless , intact healthy skin in a place that will not be rubbed against by tight clothing .
• Use the upper or lower back as the site of application because the patch is less likely to be removed by the patient .
If sites on the back are not accessible , apply the patch to the upper arm or chest .
• Do not apply to a skin area where cream , lotion , or powder has recently been applied .
( c ) Do not apply to skin that is red , irritated , or cut .
( d ) Replace the Rivastigmine Transdermal System with a new patch every 24 hours .
Instruct patients to only wear 1 patch at a time ( remove the previous day ' s patch before applying a new patch ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
If a patch falls off or if a dose is missed , apply a new patch immediately and then replace this patch the following day at the usual application time .
( e ) Change the site of patch application daily to minimize potential irritation , although a new patch can be applied to the same general anatomic site ( e . g . , another spot on the upper back ) on consecutive days .
Do not apply a new patch to the same location for at least 14 days .
( f ) May wear the patch during bathing and in hot weather .
But avoid long exposure to external heat sources ( excessive sunlight , saunas , solariums ) .
( g ) Place used patches in the previously saved pouch and discard in the trash , away from pets or children .
( h ) Wash hands with soap and water after removing the patch .
In case of contact with eyes or if the eyes become red after handling the patch , rinse immediately with plenty of water and seek medical advice if symptoms do not resolve .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Rivastigmine Transdermal System is available in 3 strengths .
Each patch has a transparent backing layer labeled as either : • Rivastigmine 4 . 6 mg / 24 hr .
• Rivastigmine 9 . 5 mg / 24 hr .
• Rivastigmine 13 . 3 mg / 24 hr .
Patch : 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours or 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours or 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Rivastigmine Transdermal System is contraindicated in patients with : • known hypersensitivity to rivastigmine , other carbamate derivatives , or other components of the formulation [ see Description ( 11 ) ] .
• previous history of application site reactions with rivastigmine transdermal patch suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Isolated cases of generalized skin reactions have been described in postmarketing experience [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
• Known hypersensitivity to rivastigmine , other carbamate derivatives , or other components of the formulation .
( 4 ) • History of application site reactions with rivastigmine transdermal patch suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis .
( 4 , 6 . 2 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hospitalization and , rarely , death have been reported due to application of multiple patches at same time .
Ensure patients or caregivers receive instruction on proper dosing and administration .
( 5 . 1 ) • Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions : May include significant nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , anorexia / decreased appetite , and weight loss , and may necessitate treatment interruption .
Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes .
( 5 . 2 ) • Application site reactions may occur with the patch form of rivastigmine .
Discontinue treatment if application site reactions spread beyond the patch size , if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction ( e . g . , increasing erythema , edema , papules , vesicles ) , and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Medication Errors Resulting in Overdose Medication errors with Rivastigmine Transdermal System have resulted in serious adverse reactions ; some cases have required hospitalization , and rarely , led to death .
The majority of medication errors have involved not removing the old patch when putting on a new one and the use of multiple patches at one time .
Instruct patients and their caregivers on important administration instructions for Rivastigmine Transdermal System [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 2 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Rivastigmine transdermal system can cause gastrointestinal adverse reactions , including significant nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , anorexia / decreased appetite , and weight loss .
Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes .
The incidence and severity of these reactions are dose - related [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
For this reason , initiate treatment with Rivastigmine Transdermal System at a dose of 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours and titrate to a dose of 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours and then to a dose of 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours , if appropriate [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
If treatment is interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance , reinitiate Rivastigmine Transdermal System with the 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours dose to reduce the possibility of severe vomiting and its potentially serious sequelae .
A postmarketing report described a case of severe vomiting with esophageal rupture following inappropriate reinitiation of treatment of an oral formulation of rivastigmine without retitration after 8 weeks of treatment interruption .
Inform caregivers to monitor for gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to inform the physician if they occur .
It is critical to inform caregivers that if therapy has been interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance , the next dose should not be administered without contacting the physician regarding proper retitration .
5 . 3 Skin Reactions Skin application site reactions may occur with Rivastigmine Transdermal System .
These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitization .
However , use of Rivastigmine Transdermal System may lead to allergic contact dermatitis .
Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch size , if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction ( e . g . increasing erythema , edema , papules , vesicles ) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal .
In these cases , treatment should be discontinued [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
In patients who develop application site reactions to Rivastigmine Transdermal System suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis and who still require rivastigmine , treatment should be switched to oral rivastigmine only after negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision .
It is possible that some patients sensitized to rivastigmine by exposure to Rivastigmine Transdermal System may not be able to take rivastigmine in any form .
There have been isolated postmarketing reports of patients experiencing disseminated allergic dermatitis when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration ( oral or transdermal ) .
In these cases , treatment should be discontinued [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly .
5 . 4 Other Adverse Reactions from Increased Cholinergic Activity Neurologic Effects Extrapyramidal Symptoms : Cholinomimetics , including rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms .
Worsening of parkinsonian symptoms , particularly tremor , has been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson ' s disease who were treated with Rivastigmine Capsules .
Seizures : Drugs that increase cholinergic activity are believed to have some potential for causing seizures .
However , seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer ' s disease .
Peptic Ulcers / Gastrointestinal Bleeding Cholinesterase inhibitors , including rivastigmine , may increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity .
Monitor patients using Rivastigmine Transdermal System for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding , especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers , e . g . , those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
Clinical studies of rivastigmine have shown no significant increase , relative to placebo , in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding .
Use with Anesthesia Rivastigmine , as a cholinesterase inhibitor , is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine - type muscle relaxation during anesthesia .
Cardiac Conduction Effects Because rivastigmine increases cholinergic activity , use of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System may have vagotonic effects on heart rate ( e . g . , bradycardia ) .
The potential for this action may be particularly important in patients with sick sinus syndrome or other supraventricular cardiac conduction conditions .
In clinical trials , rivastigmine was not associated with any increased incidence of cardiovascular adverse events , heart rate or blood pressure changes , or electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormalities .
Genitourinary Effects Although not observed in clinical trials of rivastigmine , drugs that increase cholinergic activity may cause urinary obstruction .
Pulmonary Effects Drugs that increase cholinergic activity , including Rivastigmine Transdermal System , should be used with care in patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease 5 . 5 Impairment in Driving or Use of Machinery Dementia may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to use machinery .
The administration of rivastigmine may also result in adverse reactions that are detrimental to these functions .
During treatment with the Rivastigmine Transdermal System , routinely evaluate the patient ' s ability to continue driving or operating machinery .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Rivastigmine Transdermal System has been administered to 4516 patients with Alzheimer ' s disease during clinical trials worldwide .
Of these , 3005 patients have been treated for at least 26 weeks , 1771 patients have been treated for at least 52 weeks , 974 patients have been treated for at least 78 weeks , and 24 patients have been treated for at least 104 weeks .
Mild - to - Moderate Alzheimer ' s Disease 24 - Week International Placebo - Controlled Trial ( Study 1 ) Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions in patients administered Rivastigmine Transdermal System in Study 1 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5 % in the 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System arm and at a frequency at higher than in the placebo group , were nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea .
These reactions were dose - related , with each being more common in patients using the unapproved 17 . 4 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System than in those using the 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System .
Discontinuation Rates In Study 1 , which randomized a total of 1195 patients , the proportions of patients in the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours , Rivastigmine Capsules 6 mg twice daily , and placebo groups who discontinued treatment due to adverse events were 10 % , 8 % , and 5 % , respectively .
The most common adverse reactions in the Rivastigmine Transdermal System - treated groups that led to treatment discontinuation in this study were nausea and vomiting .
The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment due to nausea were 0 . 7 % , 1 . 7 % , and 1 . 3 % in the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours , Rivastigmine Capsules 6 mg twice daily , and placebo groups , respectively .
The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting were 0 % , 2 . 0 % , and 0 . 3 % in the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours , Rivastigmine Capsules 6 mg twice daily , and placebo groups , respectively .
Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of Greater Than or Equal to 2 % Table 1 lists adverse reactions seen at an incidence of greater than or equal to 2 % in either Rivastigmine Transdermal System - treated group in Study 1 , and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with that dose of Rivastigmine Transdermal System than for those treated with placebo .
The unapproved 17 . 4 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System arm is included to demonstrate the increased rates of gastrointestinal adverse reactions over those seen with the 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System .

[ 2 ] Weight Decreased as presented in Table 1 is based upon clinical observations and / or adverse events reported by patients or caregivers .
Body weight was also monitored at prespecified time points throughout the course of the clinical study .
The proportion of patients who had weight loss equal to or greater than 7 % of their baseline weight was 8 % of those treated with Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours , 12 % of those treated with Rivastigmine Transdermal System 17 . 4 mg / 24 hours , 11 % of patients who received the Rivastigmine Capsule at doses up to 6 mg twice daily and 6 % of those who received placebo .
It is not clear how much of the weight loss was associated with anorexia , nausea , vomiting , and the diarrhea associated with the drug .
48 - Week International Active Comparator - Controlled Trial ( Study 2 ) Most Common Adverse Reactions In Study 2 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] of the commonly observed adverse reactions ( greater than or equal to 3 % in any treatment group ) , the most frequent event in the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours group was nausea , followed by vomiting , fall , weight decreased , application site erythema , decreased appetite , diarrhea and urinary tract infection ( Table 3 ) .
The percentage of patients with these events was higher in the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours group than in the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours group .
Patients with nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and decreased appetite experienced these reactions more often during the first 4 weeks of the double - blind treatment phase .
These reactions decreased over time in each treatment group .
Weight decreased was reported to have increased over time in each treatment group .
Discontinuation Rates Table 2 displays the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation during the 48 - week , double - blind treatment phase in Study 2 .

Body weight was monitored as a vital sign at pre - specified time points throughout the course of the clinical study .
The proportion of patients who had weight loss equal to or greater than 7 % of their baseline weight was 15 . 2 % of those treated with Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours and 18 . 6 % of those treated with Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours during the 48 - week double - blind treatment period .
Severe Alzheimer ' s Disease 24 - Week US Controlled Trial ( Study 3 ) Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions in patients administered Rivastigmine Transdermal System in the controlled clinical trial , defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5 % in the 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System arm and at a frequency higher than in the 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System were application site erythema , fall , insomnia , vomiting , diarrhea , weight decreased , and nausea ( Table 4 ) .
Patients in the lower dose group reported more events of agitation , urinary tract infection , and hallucinations than patients in the higher dose group .
Discontinuation Rates In Study 3 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , the proportions of patients in the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hour ( n = 355 ) and Rivastigmine Transdermal System 4 . 6 mg / 24 hour ( n = 359 ) , who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions were 21 % and 14 % , respectively .
The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in the 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours treatment group versus the 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours treatment group was agitation ( 2 . 8 % versus 2 . 2 % ) , followed by vomiting ( 2 . 5 % and 1 . 1 % ) , nausea ( 1 . 7 % and 1 . 1 % ) , decreased appetite ( 1 . 7 % and 0 % ) , aggression ( 1 . 1 % and 0 . 3 % ) , fall ( 1 . 1 % and 0 . 3 % ) and syncope ( 1 . 1 % and 0 . 3 % ) .
Otherwise , all AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in less than1 % of patients .
Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions Greater than or Equal to 5 % Other adverse reactions of interest which were observed in a higher percentage of patients in the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours group than in the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours group , included application site erythema , fall , insomnia , vomiting , diarrhea , weight decreased , and nausea ( Table 4 ) .
Overall , the majority of patients in this study experienced adverse reactions that were mild ( 30 . 7 % ) or moderate ( 32 . 1 % ) in severity .
Slightly more patients in the 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours patch group reported mild events than in the 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours patch group , while the numbers of patients reporting moderate events were comparable between groups .
Severe adverse reactions were reported at a slightly higher percentage at the higher dose ( 12 . 4 % ) than at the lower dose ( 10 % ) treatment groups .
With the exception of severe adverse reactions of agitation ( 13 . 3 mg : 1 . 1 % ; 4 . 6 mg : 1 . 4 % ) , fall ( 13 . 3 mg : 1 . 1 % ) and urinary tract infection ( 4 . 6 mg : 1 . 1 % ) , all adverse reactions reported as severe occurred in less than 1 % of patients in either treatment group .

Body weight was monitored as a vital sign at prespecified time points throughout the course of the clinical study .
The proportion of patients who had weight loss equal to or greater than 7 % of their baseline weight was 11 % of those treated with Rivastigmine Transdermal System 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours and 14 . 1 % of those treated with Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours during the 24 - week double - blind treatment .
Application Site Reactions Application site skin reactions leading to discontinuation were observed in less than or equal to 2 . 3 % of Rivastigmine Transdermal System patients .
This number was 4 . 9 % and 8 . 4 % in the Chinese population and Japanese population , respectively .
Cases of skin irritation were captured separately on an investigator - rated skin irritation scale .
Skin irritation , when observed , was mostly slight or mild in severity and was rated as severe in less than or equal to 2 . 2 % of Rivastigmine Transdermal System patients in a double - blind controlled study and in less than or equal to 3 . 7 % of Rivastigmine Transdermal System patients in a double - blind controlled study in Japanese patients .
Parkinson ' s Disease Dementia 76 - week International Open - Label Trial ( Study 4 ) Rivastigmine Transdermal System has been administered to 288 patients with mild - to - moderate Parkinson ' s Disease Dementia in a single , 76 - week , open - label , active - comparator safety study .
Of these , 256 have been treated for at least 12 weeks , 232 for at least 24 weeks , and 196 for at least 52 weeks .
Treatment with Rivastigmine Transdermal System was initiated at 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours and if tolerated the dose was increased after 4 weeks to 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours .
Rivastigmine capsule ( target maintenance dose of 12 mg / day ) served as the active comparator and was administered to 294 patients .
Adverse reactions are presented in Table 5 .

In patients with dementia associated with Parkinson ' s disease the following adverse drug reactions have only been observed in clinical trials with rivastigmine capsules : Frequent : nausea , vomiting , decreased appetite , restlessness , worsening of Parkinson ' s disease , bradycardia , diarrhea , dyspepsia , salivary hypersecretion , sweating increased ; Infrequent ( those occurring between 1 / 100 to 1 / 1000 patients ) : dystonia , atrial fibrillation , atrioventricular block .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of rivastigmine .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiac Disorders : Tachycardia Hepatobiliary Disorders : Abnormal liver function tests , hepatitis Nervous System Disorders : Parkinson ' s disease ( worsening ) , seizure , tremor Psychiatric Disorders : nightmares Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Allergic dermatitis , application site hypersensitivity , blister , disseminated allergic dermatitis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , urticaria Vascular Disorders : Hypertension 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concominant use with metoclopramide , beta - blockers , or cholinomimetics and anticholinergic medications is not recommended .
( 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Metoclopramide Due to the risk of additive extra - pyramidal adverse reactions , the concomitant use of metoclopramide and Rivastigmine Transdermal System is not recommended .
7 . 2 Cholinomimetic and Anticholinergic Medications Rivastigmine Transdermal System may increase the cholinergic effects of other cholinomimetic medications and may also interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications ( e . g . , oxybutynin , tolterodine ) .
Concomitant use of Rivastigmine Transdermal System with medications having these pharmacologic effects is not recommended unless deemed clinically necessary [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
7 . 3 Beta - blockers Additive bradycardic effects resulting in syncope may occur when rivastigmine is used concomitantly with beta - blockers , especially cardioselective beta - blockers ( including atenolol ) .
Concomitant use is not recommended when signs of bradycardia including syncope are present .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risks associated with the use of Rivastigmine Transdermal System in pregnant women .
In animals , no adverse effects on embryo - fetal development were observed at oral doses 2 - 4 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % - 4 % and 15 % - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Oral administration of rivastigmine to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis produced no adverse effects on embryo - fetal development up to the highest dose tested ( 2 . 3 mg / kg / day ) , which is 2 and 4 times , respectively , the MRHD of 12 mg per day on a body surface area ( mg / m2 ) basis .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of rivastigmine in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects of rivastigmine on milk production .
Rivastigmine and its metabolites are excreted in rat milk following oral administration of rivastigmine ; levels of rivastigmine plus metabolites in rat milk are approximately 2 times that in maternal plasma .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for rivastigmine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from rivastigmine or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
The use of Rivastigmine Transdermal System in pediatric patients ( below 18 years of age ) is not recommended .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of Rivastigmine Transdermal System , 88 % were 65 years and over , while 55 % were 75 years .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Increased exposure to rivastigmine was observed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment with oral rivastigmine .
Patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment may be able to only tolerate lower doses [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No data are available on the use of rivastigmine in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
8 . 7 Low or High Body Weight Because rivastigmine blood levels vary with weight , careful titration and monitoring should be performed in patients with low or high body weights [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdose with Rivastigmine Transdermal System has been reported in the postmarketing setting [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Overdoses have occurred from application of more than one patch at one time and not removing the previous day ' s patch before applying a new patch .
The symptoms reported in these overdose cases are similar to those seen in cases of overdose associated with rivastigmine oral formulations .
Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving , it is advisable to contact a Poison Control Center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug .
As rivastigmine has a plasma half - life of about 3 . 4 hours after patch administration and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of about 9 hours , it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose the patch should be immediately removed and no further patch should be applied for the next 24 hours .
As in any case of overdose , general supportive measures should be utilized .
Overdosage with cholinesterase inhibitors can result in cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea , vomiting , salivation , sweating , bradycardia , hypotension , respiratory depression , and convulsions .
Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved .
Atypical responses in blood pressure and heart rate have been reported with other drugs that increase cholinergic activity when coadministered with quaternary anticholinergics such as glycopyrrolate .
Additional symptoms associated with rivastigmine overdose are diarrhea , abdominal pain , dizziness , tremor , headache , somnolence , confusional state , hyperhidrosis , hypertension , hallucinations and malaise .
Due to the short plasma elimination half - life of rivastigmine after patch administration , dialysis ( hemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis , or hemofiltration ) would not be clinically indicated in the event of an overdose .
In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting , the use of antiemetics should be considered .
A fatal outcome has rarely been reported with rivastigmine overdose .
11 DESCRIPTION Rivastigmine Transdermal System contains rivastigmine , a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor known chemically as ( S ) - 3 - [ 1 - ( dimethylamino ) ethyl ] phenyl ethylmethylcarbamate .
It has an empirical formula of C14H22N2O2 as the base and a molecular weight of 250 . 34 g / mol ( as the base ) .
Rivastigmine is a viscous , clear , and colorless to yellow to very slightly brown liquid that is sparingly soluble in water and very soluble in ethanol , acetonitrile , n - octanol and ethyl acetate .
The distribution coefficient at 37 ° C in n - octanol / phosphate buffer solution pH 7 is 4 . 27 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Rivastigmine Transdermal System is for transdermal administration .
The patch is a 4 - layer laminate containing the backing layer , drug matrix , adhesive matrix and release liner ( see Figure 1 ) .
The release liner is removed and discarded prior to use .
Layer 1 : Backing Film Layer 2 : Drug Product ( Acrylic ) Matrix Layer 3 : Adhesive ( Silicone ) Matrix Layer 4 : Release Liner ( removed at time of use ) Figure 1 : Cross Section of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System [ MULTIMEDIA ] Excipients within the formulation include acrylic adhesive ( applied to a flexible polymer backing film ) , acrylates copolymer , silicone adhesive .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Although the precise mechanism of action of rivastigmine is unknown , it is thought to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function .
This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase .
The effect of rivastigmine may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact .
There is no evidence that rivastigmine alters the course of the underlying dementing process .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics After a 6 - mg oral dose of rivastigmine in humans , anticholinesterase activity is present in cerebrospinal fluid for about 10 hours , with a maximum inhibition of about 60 % 5 hours after dosing .
In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that the inhibition of cholinesterase by rivastigmine is not affected by the concomitant administration of memantine , an N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor antagonist .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After the initial application of rivastigmine transdermal system , there is a lag time of 0 . 5 to 1 hour in the absorption of rivastigmine .
Concentrations then rise slowly typically reaching a maximum after 8 hours , although maximum values ( Cmax ) can also occur later ( at 10 to 16 hours ) .
After the peak , plasma concentrations slowly decrease over the remainder of the 24 - hour period of application .
At steady state , trough levels are approximately 60 % to 80 % of peak levels .
Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours gave exposure approximately the same as that provided by an oral dose of 6 mg twice daily ( i . e . , 12 mg / day ) .
Inter - subject variability in exposure was lower ( 43 % to 49 % ) for the Rivastigmine Transdermal System formulation as compared with the oral formulations ( 73 % to 103 % ) .
Fluctuation ( between Cmax and Cmin ) is less for Rivastigmine Transdermal System than for the oral formulation of rivastigmine .
Figure 2 displays rivastigmine plasma concentrations over 24 hours for the 3 available patch strengths .
Figure 2 : Rivastigmine Plasma Concentrations Following Dermal 24 - Hour Patch Application [ MULTIMEDIA ] Over a 24 - hour dermal application , approximately 50 % of the drug content of the patch is released from the system .
Exposure area under the plasma concentration - time curve from time zero to infinity ( AUC ∞ ) to rivastigmine ( and metabolite NAP266 - 90 ) was highest when the patch was applied to the upper back , chest , or upper arm .
Two other sites ( abdomen and thigh ) could be used if none of the 3 other sites is available , but the practitioner should be aware that the rivastigmine plasma exposure associated with these sites was approximately 20 % to 30 % lower .
There was no relevant accumulation of rivastigmine or the metabolite NAP226 - 90 in plasma in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease with daily dosing .
The pharmacokinetic profile of rivastigmine transdermal patches was comparable in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease and in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson ' s disease .
Distribution Rivastigmine is weakly bound to plasma proteins ( approximately 40 % ) over the therapeutic range .
It readily crosses the blood - brain barrier , reaching CSF peak concentrations in 1 . 4 to 2 . 6 hours .
It has an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1 . 8 to 2 . 7 L / kg .
Metabolism Rivastigmine is extensively metabolized primarily via cholinesterase - mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite NAP226 - 90 .
In vitro , this metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase ( less than 10 % ) .
Based on evidence from in vitro and animal studies , the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism .
The metabolite - to - parent AUC ∞ ratio was about 0 . 7 after Rivastigmine Transdermal System application versus 3 . 5 after oral administration , indicating that much less metabolism occurred after dermal treatment .
Less NAP226 - 90 is formed following patch application , presumably because of the lack of presystemic ( hepatic first pass ) metabolism .
Based on in vitro studies , no unique metabolic routes were detected in human skin .
Elimination Renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route of elimination .
Unchanged rivastigmine is found in trace amounts in the urine .
Following administration of 14 C - rivastigmine , renal elimination was rapid and essentially complete ( greater than 90 % ) within 24 hours .
Less than 1 % of the administered dose is excreted in the feces .
The apparent elimination half - life in plasma is approximately 3 hours after patch removal .
Renal clearance was approximately 2 . 1 to 2 . 8 L / hr .
Age Age had no impact on the exposure to rivastigmine in Alzheimer ' s disease patients treated with Rivastigmine Transdermal System .
Gender and Race No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effect of gender and race on the disposition of Rivastigmine Transdermal System .
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of oral rivastigmine indicated that neither gender ( n = 277 males and 348 females ) nor race ( n = 575 Caucasian , 34 Black , 4 Asian , and 12 Other ) affected clearance of the drug .
Similar results were seen with analyses of pharmacokinetic data obtained after the administration of Rivastigmine Transdermal System .
Body Weight A relationship between drug exposure at steady state ( rivastigmine and metabolite NAP226 - 90 ) and body weight was observed in Alzheimer ' s dementia patients .
Rivastigmine exposure is higher in subjects with low body weight .
Compared to a patient with a body weight of 65 kg , the rivastigmine steady - state concentrations in a patient with a body weight of 35 kg would be approximately doubled , while for a patient with a body weight of 100 kg the concentrations would be approximately halved [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Renal Impairment No study was conducted with Rivastigmine Transdermal System in subjects with renal impairment .
Based on population analysis creatinine clearance did not show any clear effect on steady state concentrations of rivastigmine or its metabolite .
Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic study was conducted with Rivastigmine Transdermal System in subjects with hepatic impairment .
Following a single 3 - mg dose , mean oral clearance of rivastigmine was 60 % lower in hepatically impaired patients ( n = 10 , biopsy proven ) than in healthy subjects ( n = 10 ) .
After multiple 6 - mg twice a day oral dosing , the mean clearance of rivastigmine was 65 % lower in mild ( n = 7 , Child - Pugh score 5 to 6 ) and moderate ( n = 3 , Child - Pugh score 7 to 9 ) hepatically impaired patients ( biopsy proven , liver cirrhosis ) than in healthy subjects ( n = 10 ) .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Smoking Following oral rivastigmine administration ( up to 12 mg / day ) with nicotine use , population pharmacokinetic analysis showed increased oral clearance of rivastigmine by 23 % ( n = 75 smokers and 549 nonsmokers ) .
Drug Interaction Studies No specific interaction studies have been conducted with Rivastigmine Transdermal System .
Information presented below is from studies with oral rivastigmine .
Effect of Rivastigmine on the Metabolism of Other Drugs Rivastigmine is primarily metabolized through hydrolysis by esterases .
Minimal metabolism occurs via the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes .
Based on in vitro studies , no pharmacokinetic drug interactions with drugs metabolized by the following isoenzyme systems are expected : CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , CYP3A4 / 5 , CYP2E1 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C19 , or CYP2B6 .
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine taken orally and digoxin , warfarin , diazepam or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers .
The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of rivastigmine .
Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Rivastigmine Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP450 metabolism are not expected to alter the metabolism of rivastigmine .
Population pharmacokinetic analysis with a database of 625 patients showed that the pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine taken orally were not influenced by commonly prescribed medications such as antacids ( n = 77 ) , antihypertensives ( n = 72 ) , beta - blockers ( n = 42 ) , calcium channel blockers ( n = 75 ) , antidiabetics ( n = 21 ) , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( n = 79 ) , estrogens ( n = 70 ) , salicylate analgesics ( n = 177 ) , antianginals ( n = 35 ) , and antihistamines ( n = 15 ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In oral carcinogenicity studies conducted at doses up to 1 . 1 mg / kg / day in rats and 1 . 6 mg / kg / day in mice , rivastigmine was not carcinogenic .
In a dermal carcinogenicity study conducted at doses up to 0 . 75 mg base / kg / day in mice , rivastigmine was not carcinogenic .
The mean rivastigmine plasma exposure ( AUC ) at this dose was less than that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose ( 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours ) .
Mutagenesis Rivastigmine was clastogenic in in vitro chromosomal aberration assays in mammalian cells in the presence , but not the absence , of metabolic activation .
Rivastigmine was negative in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay , an in vitro HGPRT assay , and in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
Impairment of Fertility No fertility or reproduction studies of dermal rivastigmine have been conducted in animals .
Rivastigmine had no effect on fertility or reproductive performance in rats at oral doses up to 1 . 1 mg / kg / day .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System in dementia of the Alzheimer ' s type and dementia associated with Parkinson ' s disease was based on the results of 3 controlled trials of Rivastigmine Transdermal System in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease ( Studies 1 , 2 , and 3 ) ( see below ) ; 3 controlled trials of oral rivastigmine in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer ' s type ; and 1 controlled trial of oral rivastigmine in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson ' s disease .
See the prescribing information for oral rivastigmine for details of the four studies of oral rivastigmine .
Mild - to - Moderate Alzheimer ' s Disease International 24 - Week Study of Rivastigmine Transdermal System in Dementia of the Alzheimer ' s Type ( Study 1 ) This study was a randomized double - blind , double dummy clinical investigation in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease [ diagnosed by NINCDS - ADRDA and DSM - IV criteria , Mini - Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) score greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 20 ] ( Study 1 ) .
The mean age of patients participating in this trial was 74 years with a range of 50 to 90 years .
Approximately 67 % of patients were women , and 33 % were men .
The racial distribution was Caucasian 75 % , Black 1 % , Asian 9 % , and other races 15 % .
The effectiveness of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System was evaluated in Study 1 using a dual outcome assessment strategy , evaluating for changes in both cognitive performance and overall clinical effect .
The ability of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer ' s Disease Assessment Scale ( ADAS - Cog ) , a multi - item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer ' s disease patients .
The ADAS - Cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance including elements of memory , orientation , attention , reasoning , language , and praxis .
The ADAS - Cog scoring range is from 0 to 70 , with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment .
Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1 , but it is not unusual for non - demented adults to score slightly higher .
The ability of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System to produce an overall clinical effect was assessed using the Alzheimer ' s Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Change ( ADCS - CGIC ) .
The ADCS - CGIC is a more standardized form of the Clinician ' s Interview - Based Impression of Change - Plus ( CIBIC - Plus ) and is also scored as a 7 - point categorical rating ; scores range from 1 , indicating " markedly improved , " to 4 , indicating " no change , " to 7 , indicating " marked worsening . "
In Study 1 , 1195 patients were randomized to 1 of the following 4 treatments : Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours , Rivastigmine Transdermal System 17 . 4 mg / 24 hours , Rivastigmine Capsules in a dose of 6 mg twice daily , or placebo .
This 24 - week study was divided into a 16 - week titration phase followed by an 8 - week maintenance phase .
In the active treatment arms of this study , doses below the target dose were permitted during the maintenance phase in the event of poor tolerability .
Figure 3 illustrates the time course for the change from baseline in ADAS - Cog scores for all 4 treatment groups over the 24 - week study .
At 24 weeks , the mean differences in the ADAS - Cog change scores for the rivastigmine - treated patients compared to the patients on placebo , were 1 . 8 , 2 . 9 , and 1 . 8 units for the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours , Rivastigmine Transdermal System 17 . 4 mg / 24 hours , and Rivastigmine Capsule 6 mg twice daily groups , respectively .
The difference between each of these groups and placebo was statistically significant .
Although a slight improvement was observed with the 17 . 4 mg / 24 hours patch compared to the 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours patch on this outcome measure , no meaningful difference between the two was seen on the global evaluation ( see Figure 4 ) .
Figure 3 : Time Course of the Change from Baseline in ADAS - Cog Score for Patients Observed at Each Time Point in Study 1 [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 4 presents the distribution of patients ' scores on the ADCS - CGIC for all 4 treatment groups .
At 24 weeks , the mean difference in the ADCS - CGIC scores for the comparison of patients in each of the rivastigmine - treated groups with the patients on placebo was 0 . 2 units .
The difference between each of these groups and placebo was statistically significant .
Figure 4 : Distribution of ADCS - CGIC Scores for Patients Completing Study 1 [ MULTIMEDIA ] International 48 - Week Study of Rivastigmine Transdermal System in Dementia of the Alzheimer ' s Type ( Study 2 ) This study was a randomized double - blind clinical investigation in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease [ diagnosed by NINCDS - ADRDA and DSM - IV criteria , Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 24 ] ( Study 2 ) .
The mean age of patients participating in this trial was 76 years with a range of 50 to 85 years .
Approximately 65 % of patients were women and 35 % were men .
The racial distribution was approximately Caucasian 97 % , Black 2 % , Asian 0 . 5 % , and other races 1 % .
Approximately 27 % of the patients were taking memantine throughout the entire duration of the study .
Alzheimer ' s disease patients who received 24 to 48 weeks open - label treatment with Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours and who demonstrated functional and cognitive decline were randomized into treatment with either Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours or Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours in a 48 - week , double - blind treatment phase .
Functional decline was assessed by the investigator and cognitive decline was defined as a decrease in the MMSE score of greater than or equal to 2 points from the previous visit or a decrease of greater than or equal to 3 points from baseline .
Study 2 was designed to compare the efficacy of Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours versus that of Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours during the 48 - week , double - blind treatment phase .
The ability of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours to improve cognitive performance over that provided by the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours was assessed by the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer ' s Disease Assessment Scale ( ADAS - Cog ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The ability of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours to improve overall function versus that provided by Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours was assessed by the instrumental subscale of the Alzheimer ' s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living ( ADCS - IADL ) .
The ADCS - IADL subscale is composed of items 7 to 23 of the caregiver - based ADCS - ADL scale .
The ADCS - IADL assesses activities such as those necessary for communicating and interacting with other people , maintaining a household , and conducting hobbies and interests .
A sum score is calculated by adding the scores of the individual items and can range from 0 to 56 , with higher scores indicating less impairment .
Out of a total of 1584 patients enrolled in the initial open - label phase of the study , 567 patients were classified as decliners and were randomized into the 48 - week double - blind treatment phase of the study .
Two hundred eighty - seven ( 287 ) patients entered the 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System treatment group and 280 patients entered the 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System treatment group .
Figure 5 illustrates the time course for the mean change from double - blind baseline in ADCS - IADL scores for each treatment group over the course of the 48 - week treatment phase of the study .
Decline in the mean ADCS - IADL score from the double - blind baseline for the Intent to Treat – Last Observation Carried Forward ( ITT - LOCF ) analysis was less at each time point in the 13 . 3 mg / 24 hour Rivastigmine Transdermal System treatment group than in the 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System treatment group .
The 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours dose was statistically significantly superior to the 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours dose at weeks 16 , 24 , 32 , and 48 ( primary endpoint ) .
Figure 6 illustrates the time course for the mean change from double - blind baseline in ADAS - Cog scores for both treatment groups over the 48 - week treatment phase .
The between - treatment group difference for Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours versus Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9 . 5 mg / 24 hours was nominally statistically significant at week 24 ( p = 0 . 027 ) , but not at week 48 ( p = 0 . 227 ) , which was the primary endpoint .

The mean age of patients participating in this trial was 78 years with a range of 51 to 96 years with 62 % aged greater than 75 years .
Approximately 65 % of patients were women and 35 % were men .
The racial distribution was approximately Caucasian 87 % , Black 7 % , Asian 1 % , and other races 5 % .
Patients on a stable dose of memantine were permitted to enter the study .
Approximately 61 % of the patients in each treatment group were taking memantine throughout the entire duration of the study .
The study was designed to compare the efficacy of Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours versus that of Rivastigmine Transdermal System 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours during the 24 - week double - blind treatment phase .
The ability of the 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System to improve cognitive performance versus that provided by the 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System was assessed with the Severe Impairment Battery ( SIB ) which uses a validated 40 - item scale developed for the evaluation of the severity of cognitive dysfunction in more advanced AD patients .
The domains assessed included social interaction , memory , language , attention , orientation , praxis , visuospatial ability , construction , and orienting to name .
The SIB was scored from 0 to 100 , with higher scores reflecting higher levels of cognitive ability .
The ability of the 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System to improve overall function versus that provided by the 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System was assessed with the Alzheimer ' s Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living – Severe Impairment Version ( ADCS - ADL - SIV ) which is a caregiver - based ADL scale composed of 19 items developed for use in clinical studies of dementia .
It is designed to assess the patient ' s performance of both basic and instrumental activities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care , communicating and interacting with other people , maintaining a household , conducting hobbies and interests , and making judgments and decisions .
A sum score is calculated by adding the scores of the individual items and can range from 0 to 54 , with higher scores indicating less functional impairment .
In this study , 716 patients were randomized into one of the following treatments : Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours or Rivastigmine Transdermal System 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours in a 1 : 1 ratio .
This 24 - week study was divided into an 8 - week titration phase followed by a 16 - week maintenance phase .
In the active treatment arms of this study , temporary dose adjustments below the target dose were permitted during the titration and maintenance phase in the event of poor tolerability .
Figure 7 illustrates the time course for the mean change from baseline SIB scores for each treatment group over the course of the 24 - week treatment phase of the study .
Decline in the mean SIB score from the baseline for the Modified Full Analysis Set ( MFAS ) - Last Observation Carried Forward ( LOCF ) analysis was less at each timepoint in the 13 . 3 mg / 24 hour Rivastigmine Transdermal System treatment group than in the 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System treatment group .
The 13 . 3 mg / 24 hours dose was statistically significantly superior to the 4 . 6 mg / 24 hours dose at weeks 16 and 24 ( primary endpoint ) .
