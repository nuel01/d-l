6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Additionally , because many subjects who participated in clinical trials with atovaquone had complications of advanced human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) disease , it was often difficult to distinguish adverse reactions caused by atovaquone from those caused by underlying medical conditions .
PCP Prevention Trials In 2 clinical trials , atovaquone oral suspension was compared with dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine in HIV - 1 - infected adolescent ( 13 to 18 years ) and adult subjects at risk of PCP ( CD4 count < 200 cells / mm3 or a prior episode of PCP ) and unable to tolerate TMP - SMX .
Dapsone Comparative Trial : In the dapsone comparative trial ( n = 1 , 057 ) , the majority of subjects were white ( 64 % ) , male ( 88 % ) , and receiving prophylaxis for PCP at randomization ( 73 % ) ; the mean age was 38 years .
Subjects received atovaquone oral suspension 1 , 500 mg once daily ( n = 536 ) or dapsone 100 mg once daily ( n = 521 ) ; median durations of exposure were 6 . 7 and 6 . 5 months , respectively .
Adverse reaction data were collected only for adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of treatment , which occurred at similar frequencies in subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension or dapsone ( Table 1 ) .
Among subjects taking neither dapsone nor atovaquone at enrollment ( n = 487 ) , adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of treatment occurred in 43 % of subjects treated with dapsone and 20 % of subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension .
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions ( nausea , diarrhea , and vomiting ) were more frequently reported in subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension ( Table 1 ) .

Subjects received atovaquone oral suspension once daily at a dose of 750 mg ( n = 188 ) or 1 , 500 mg ( n = 175 ) or received aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg every 4 weeks ( n = 186 ) ; the median durations of exposure were 6 . 2 , 6 , and 7 . 8 months , respectively .
Table 2 summarizes the clinical adverse reactions reported by ≥ 20 % of the subjects receiving either the 1 , 500 - mg dose of atovaquone oral suspension or aerosolized pentamidine .
Rash occurred more often in subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension ( 46 % ) than in subjects treated with aerosolized pentamidine ( 28 % ) .
Treatment - limiting adverse reactions occurred in 25 % of subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension 1 , 500 mg once daily and in 7 % of subjects treated with aerosolized pentamidine .
The most frequent adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of dosing in the group receiving atovaquone oral suspension 1 , 500 mg once daily were rash ( 6 % ) , diarrhea ( 4 % ) , and nausea ( 3 % ) .
The most frequent adverse reaction requiring discontinuation of dosing in the group receiving aerosolized pentamidine was bronchospasm ( 2 % ) .

PCP Treatment Trials Safety information is presented from 2 clinical efficacy trials of the atovaquone tablet formulation : 1 ) a randomized , double - blind trial comparing atovaquone tablets with TMP - SMX in subjects with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and mild - to - moderate PCP [ ( A - a ) DO2 ] ≤ 45 mm Hg and PaO2 ≥ 60 mm Hg on room air ; 2 ) a randomized , open - label trial comparing atovaquone tablets with intravenous ( IV ) pentamidine isethionate in subjects with mild - to - moderate PCP who could not tolerate trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials .
TMP - SMX Comparative Trial : In the TMP - SMX comparative trial ( n = 408 ) , the majority of subjects were white ( 66 % ) and male ( 95 % ) ; the mean age was 36 years .
Subjects received atovaquone 750 mg ( three 250 - mg tablets ) 3 times daily for 21 days or TMP 320 mg plus SMX 1 , 600 mg 3 times daily for 21 days ; median durations of exposure were 21 and 15 days , respectively .
Table 3 summarizes all clinical adverse reactions reported by ≥ 10 % of the trial population regardless of attribution .
Nine percent of subjects who received atovaquone and 24 % of subjects who received TMP - SMX discontinued therapy due to an adverse reaction .
Among the subjects who discontinued , 4 % of subjects receiving atovaquone and 8 % of subjects in the TMP - SMX group discontinued therapy due to rash .
The incidence of adverse reactions with atovaquone oral suspension at the recommended dose ( 750 mg twice daily ) was similar to that seen with the tablet formulation .

Pentamidine Comparative Trial : In the pentamidine comparative trial ( n = 174 ) , the majority of subjects in the primary therapy trial population ( n = 145 ) were white ( 72 % ) and male ( 97 % ) ; the mean age was 37 years .
Subjects received atovaquone 750 mg ( three 250 - mg tablets ) 3 times daily for 21 days or a 3 - to 4 - mg / kg single pentamidine isethionate IV infusion daily for 21 days ; the median durations of exposure were 21 and 14 days , respectively .
Table 4 summarizes the clinical adverse reactions reported by ≥ 10 % of the primary therapy trial population regardless of attribution .
Fewer subjects who received atovaquone reported adverse reactions than subjects who received pentamidine ( 63 % vs . 72 % ) .
However , only 7 % of subjects discontinued treatment with atovaquone due to adverse reactions , while 41 % of subjects who received pentamidine discontinued treatment for this reason .
Of the 5 subjects who discontinued therapy with atovaquone , 3 reported rash ( 4 % ) .
Rash was not severe in any subject .
The most frequently cited reasons for discontinuation of pentamidine therapy were hypoglycemia ( 11 % ) and vomiting ( 9 % ) .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin reduces atovaquone concentrations ; concomitant use with atovaquone oral suspension is not recommended .
( 7 . 1 ) • Concomitant administration of tetracycline reduces atovaquone concentrations ; use caution when coadministering .
Monitor patients for potential loss of efficacy of atovaquone if coadministration of tetracycline is necessary .
( 7 . 2 ) • Concomitant administration with metoclopramide reduces atovaquone concentrations ; administer concomitantly only if other antiemetics are not available .
( 7 . 3 ) • Concomitant administration of indinavir reduces indinavir trough concentrations ; use caution when coadministering .
Monitor patients for potential loss of efficacy of indinavir if coadministration is necessary .
( 7 . 4 ) 7 . 1 Rifampin / Rifabutin Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin and atovaquone oral suspension is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Concomitant administration of atovaquone oral suspension and rifampin or rifabutin is not recommended .
7 . 2 Tetracycline Concomitant administration of tetracycline and atovaquone oral suspension has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Caution should be used when prescribing tetracycline concomitantly with atovaquone oral suspension .
Monitor patients for potential loss of efficacy of atovaquone if coadministration is necessary .
7 . 3 Metoclopramide Metoclopramide may reduce the bioavailability of atovaquone and should be used only if other antiemetics are not available [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 4 Indinavir Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady - state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone oral suspension with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir .
Monitor patients for potential loss of efficacy of indinavir if coadministration with atovaquone oral suspension is necessary .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Atovaquone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Atovaquone was not teratogenic and did not cause reproductive toxicity in rats at plasma concentrations up to 2 to 3 times the estimated human exposure ( dose of 1 , 000 mg / kg / day in rats ) .
Atovaquone caused maternal toxicity in rabbits at plasma concentrations that were approximately one - half the estimated human exposure .
Mean fetal body lengths and weights were decreased and there were higher numbers of early resorption and post - implantation loss per dam ( dose of 1 , 200 mg / kg / day in rabbits ) .
It is not clear whether these effects were caused by atovaquone directly or were secondary to maternal toxicity .
Concentrations of atovaquone in rabbit fetuses averaged 30 % of the concurrent maternal plasma concentrations .
In a separate study in rats given a single 14 C - radiolabelled dose ( 1 , 000 mg / kg ) , concentrations of radiocarbon in rat fetuses were 18 % ( middle gestation ) and 60 % ( late gestation ) of concurrent maternal plasma concentrations .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether atovaquone is excreted into human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted into human milk , caution should be exercised when atovaquone is administered to a nursing woman .
In a rat study ( with doses of 10 and 250 mg / kg ) , atovaquone concentrations in the milk were 30 % of the concurrent atovaquone concentrations in the maternal plasma at both doses .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Evidence of safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients ( aged 12 years and younger ) has not been established .
In a trial of atovaquone oral suspension administered once daily with food for 12 days to 27 HIV - 1 - infected , asymptomatic infants and children aged between 1 month and 13 years , the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone were age - dependent .
The average steady - state plasma atovaquone concentrations in the 24 subjects with available concentration data are shown in Table 5 .

8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of atovaquone did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
10 OVERDOSAGE In one patient who took an unspecified dose of dapsone , methemoglobinemia occurred .
Rash has also been reported after overdose .
There is no known antidote for atovaquone , and it is currently unknown if atovaquone is dialyzable .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Atovaquone is a quinone antimicrobial drug [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Atovaquone is a highly lipophilic compound with low aqueous solubility .
The bioavailability of atovaquone is highly dependent on formulation and diet .
The absolute bioavailability of a 750 - mg dose of atovaquone oral suspension administered under fed conditions in 9 HIV - 1 - infected ( CD4 > 100 cells / mm3 ) volunteers was 47 % ± 15 % .
Administering atovaquone with food enhances its absorption by approximately 2 - fold .
In one trial , 16 healthy volunteers received a single dose of 750 mg atovaquone oral suspension after an overnight fast and following a standard breakfast ( 23 g fat : 610 kCal ) .
The mean ( ± SD ) area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC ) values under fasting and fed conditions were 324 ± 115 and 801 ± 320 h ● mcg / mL , respectively , representing a 2 . 6 ± 1 - fold increase .
The effect of food ( 23 g fat : 400 kCal ) on plasma atovaquone concentrations was also evaluated in a multiple - dose , randomized , crossover trial in 19 HIV - 1 - infected volunteers ( CD4 < 200 cells / mm3 ) receiving daily doses of 500 mg atovaquone oral suspension .
AUC values under fasting and fed conditions were 169 ± 77 and 280 ± 114 h ● mcg / mL , respectively .
Maximum plasma atovaquone concentration ( Cmax ) values under fasting and fed conditions were 8 . 8 ± 3 . 7 and 15 . 1 ± 6 . 1 mcg / mL , respectively .
Dose Proportionality Plasma atovaquone concentrations do not increase proportionally with dose .
When atovaquone oral suspension was administered with food at dosage regimens of 500 mg once daily , 750 mg once daily , and 1 , 000 mg once daily , average steady - state plasma atovaquone concentrations were 11 . 7 ± 4 . 8 , 12 . 5 ± 5 . 8 , and 13 . 5 ± 5 . 1 mcg / mL , respectively .
The corresponding Cmax concentrations were 15 . 1 ± 6 . 1 , 15 . 3 ± 7 . 6 , and 16 . 8 ± 6 . 4 mcg / mL .
When atovaquone oral suspension was administered to 5 HIV - 1 - infected volunteers at a dose of 750 mg twice daily , the average steady - state plasma atovaquone concentration was 21 ± 4 . 9 mcg / mL and Cmax was 24 ± 5 . 7 mcg / mL .
The minimum plasma atovaquone concentration ( Cmin ) associated with the 750 - mg twice - daily regimen was 16 . 7 ± 4 . 6 mcg / mL .
Distribution Following IV administration of atovaquone , the volume of distribution at steady state ( Vdss ) was 0 . 60 ± 0 . 17 L / kg ( n = 9 ) .
Atovaquone is extensively bound to plasma proteins ( 99 . 9 % ) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 mcg / mL .
In 3 HIV - 1 - infected children who received 750 mg atovaquone as the tablet formulation 4 times daily for 2 weeks , the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of atovaquone were 0 . 04 , 0 . 14 , and 0 . 26 mcg / mL , representing less than 1 % of the plasma concentration .
Elimination The plasma clearance of atovaquone following IV administration in 9 HIV - 1 - infected volunteers was 10 . 4 ± 5 . 5 mL / min ( 0 . 15 ± 0 . 09 mL / min / kg ) .
The half - life of atovaquone was 62 . 5 ± 35 . 3 hours after IV administration and ranged from 67 ± 33 . 4 to 77 . 6 ± 23 . 1 hours across trials following administration of atovaquone oral suspension .
The half - life of atovaquone is due to presumed enterohepatic cycling and eventual fecal elimination .
In a trial where 14 C - labelled atovaquone was administered to healthy volunteers , greater than 94 % of the dose was recovered as unchanged atovaquone in the feces over 21 days .
There was little or no excretion of atovaquone in the urine ( less than 0 . 6 % ) .
There is indirect evidence that atovaquone may undergo limited metabolism ; however , a specific metabolite has not been identified .
Hepatic / Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of atovaquone have not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment .
Relationship between Plasma Atovaquone Concentration and Clinical Outcome In a comparative trial of atovaquone tablets with TMP - SMX for oral treatment of mild - to - moderate PCP [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] , where subjects with HIV / AIDS received atovaquone tablets 750 mg 3 times daily for 21 days , the mean steady - state atovaquone concentration was 13 . 9 ± 6 . 9 mcg / mL ( n = 133 ) .
Analysis of these data established a relationship between plasma atovaquone concentration and successful treatment ( Table 6 ) .

Improvement in clinical and respiratory measures was assessed using a composite of parameters that included oral body temperature , respiratory rate , severity scores for cough , dyspnea , and chest pain / tightness .
This analysis was based on data from subjects for whom both outcome and steady - state plasma atovaquone concentration data were available .
b Based on logistic regression analysis .
A dosing regimen of atovaquone oral suspension for the treatment of mild - to - moderate PCP was selected to achieve average plasma atovaquone concentrations of approximately 20 mcg / mL , because this plasma concentration was previously shown to be well tolerated and associated with the highest treatment success rates ( Table 6 ) .
In an open - label PCP treatment trial with atovaquone oral suspension , dosing regimens of 1 , 000 mg once daily , 750 mg twice daily , 1 , 500 mg once daily , and 1 , 000 mg twice daily were explored .
The average steady - state plasma atovaquone concentration achieved at the 750 - mg twice - daily dose given with meals was 22 ± 10 . 1 mcg / mL ( n = 18 ) .
Drug Interactions Rifampin / Rifabutin : In a trial with 13 HIV - 1 - infected volunteers , the oral administration of rifampin 600 mg every 24 hours with atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg every 12 hours resulted in a 52 % ± 13 % decrease in the average steady - state plasma atovaquone concentration and a 37 % ± 42 % increase in the average steady - state plasma rifampin concentration .
The half - life of atovaquone decreased from 82 ± 36 hours when administered without rifampin to 50 ± 16 hours with rifampin .
In a trial of 24 healthy volunteers , the oral administration of rifabutin 300 mg once daily with atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg twice daily resulted in a 34 % decrease in the average steady - state plasma atovaquone concentration and a 19 % decrease in the average steady - state plasma rifabutin concentration .
Tetracycline : Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a 40 % reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone .
Metoclopramide : Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide has been associated with decreased bioavailability of atovaquone .
Indinavir : Concomitant administration of atovaquone ( 750 mg twice daily with food for 14 days ) and indinavir ( 800 mg three times daily without food for 14 days ) did not result in any change in the steady - state AUC and Cmax of indinavir , but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir ( 23 % decrease [ 90 % CI : 8 % , 35 % ] ) .
Trimethoprim / Sulfamethoxazole : The possible interaction between atovaquone and TMP - SMX was evaluated in 6 HIV - 1 - infected adult volunteers as part of a larger multiple - dose , dose - escalation , and chronic dosing trial of atovaquone oral suspension .
In this crossover trial , atovaquone oral suspension 500 mg once daily ( not the approved dosage ) , or TMP - SMX tablets ( trimethoprim 160 mg and sulfamethoxazole 800 mg ) twice daily , or the combination were administered with food to achieve steady state .
No difference was observed in the average steady - state plasma atovaquone concentration after coadministration with TMP - SMX .
Coadministration of atovaquone with TMP - SMX resulted in a 17 % and 8 % decrease in average steady - state concentrations of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in plasma , respectively .
Zidovudine : Data from 14 HIV - 1 - infected volunteers who were given atovaquone tablets 750 mg every 12 hours with zidovudine 200 mg every 8 hours showed a 24 % ± 12 % decrease in zidovudine apparent oral clearance , leading to a 35 % ± 23 % increase in plasma zidovudine AUC .
The glucuronide metabolite : parent ratio decreased from a mean of 4 . 5 when zidovudine was administered alone to 3 . 1 when zidovudine was administered with atovaquone tablets .
This effect is minor and would not be expected to produce clinically significant events .
Zidovudine had no effect on atovaquone pharmacokinetics .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Atovaquone is a hydroxy - 1 , 4 - naphthoquinone , an analog of ubiquinone , with antipneumocystis activity .
The mechanism of action against Pneumocystis jirovecii has not been fully elucidated .
In Plasmodium species , the site of action appears to be the cytochrome bc1 complex ( Complex III ) .
Several metabolic enzymes are linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via ubiquinone .
Inhibition of electron transport by atovaquone results in indirect inhibition of these enzymes .
The ultimate metabolic effects of such blockade may include inhibition of nucleic acid and adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) synthesis .
Activity In Vitro Several laboratories , using different in vitro methodologies , have shown the IC50 ( 50 % inhibitory concentration ) of atovaquone against P . jirovecii to be 0 . 1 to 3 mcg / mL .
Drug Resistance Phenotypic resistance to atovaquone in vitro has not been demonstrated for P . jirovecii .
However , in 2 subjects who developed PCP after prophylaxis with atovaquone , DNA sequence analysis identified mutations in the predicted amino acid sequence of P . jirovecii cytochrome b ( a likely target site for atovaquone ) .
The clinical significance of this is unknown .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies in rats were negative ; 24 - month studies in mice ( dosed with 50 , 100 , or 200 mg / kg / day ) , showed treatment - related increases in incidence of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma at all doses tested , which correlated with 1 . 4 to 3 . 6 times the average steady - state plasma concentrations in humans during acute treatment of PCP .
Atovaquone was negative with or without metabolic activation in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay , the mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay , and the cultured human lymphocyte cytogenetic assay .
No evidence of genotoxicity was observed in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Prevention of PCP The indication for prevention of PCP is based on the results of 2 clinical trials comparing atovaquone oral suspension with dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine in HIV - 1 - infected adolescent ( aged 13 to 18 years ) and adult subjects at risk of PCP ( CD4 count < 200 cells / mm3 or a prior episode of PCP ) and unable to tolerate TMP - SMX .
Dapsone Comparative Trial This open - label trial enrolled 1 , 057 subjects , randomized to receive atovaquone oral suspension 1 , 500 mg once daily ( n = 536 ) or dapsone 100 mg once daily ( n = 521 ) .
The majority of subjects were white ( 64 % ) , male ( 88 % ) , and receiving prophylaxis for PCP at randomization ( 73 % ) ; the mean age was 38 years .
Median follow - up was 24 months .
Subjects randomized to the dapsone arm who were seropositive for Toxoplasma gondii and had a CD4 count < 100 cells / mm3 also received pyrimethamine and folinic acid .
PCP event rates are shown in Table 7 .
Mortality rates were similar .
Aerosolized Pentamidine Comparative Trial This open - label trial enrolled 549 subjects , randomized to receive atovaquone oral suspension 1 , 500 mg once daily ( n = 175 ) , atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg once daily ( n = 188 ) , or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg once monthly ( n = 186 ) .
The majority of subjects were white ( 79 % ) , male ( 92 % ) , and were primary prophylaxis patients at enrollment ( 58 % ) ; the mean age was 38 years .
Median follow - up was 11 . 3 months .
The results of the PCP event rates appear in Table 7 .
Mortality rates were similar among the groups .
Table 7 .

b Relative risk < 1 favors atovaquone and values > 1 favor comparator .
Trial results did not show superiority of atovaquone to the comparator .
c The confidence level of the interval for the dapsone comparative trial was 95 % and for the pentamidine comparative trial was 97 . 5 % .
An analysis of all PCP events ( intent - to - treat analysis ) for both trials showed results similar to those shown in Table 7 .
14 . 2 Treatment of PCP The indication for treatment of mild - to - moderate PCP is based on the results of 2 efficacy trials : a randomized , double - blind trial comparing atovaquone tablets with TMP - SMX in subjects with HIV / AIDS and mild - to - moderate PCP ( defined in the protocol as [ ( A - a ) DO2 ] ≤ 45 mm Hg and PaO2 ≥ 60 mm Hg on room air ) and a randomized open - label trial comparing atovaquone tablets with IV pentamidine isethionate in subjects with mild - to - moderate PCP who could not tolerate trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials .
Both trials were conducted with the tablet formulation using 750 mg three times daily .
Results from these efficacy trials established a relationship between plasma atovaquone concentration and successful outcome .
Successful outcome was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy .
Comparative pharmacokinetic trials of the oral suspension and tablet formulations established the currently recommended oral suspension dose of 750 mg twice daily [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
TMP - SMX Comparative Trial This double - blind , randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of atovaquone tablets with that of TMP - SMX for the treatment of subjects with HIV / AIDS and histologically confirmed PCP .
Only subjects with mild - to - moderate PCP were eligible for enrollment .
A total of 408 subjects were enrolled into the trial .
The majority of subjects were white ( 66 % ) and male ( 95 % ) ; the mean age was 36 years .
Eighty - six subjects without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses .
Of the 322 subjects with histologically confirmed PCP , 160 were randomized to receive 750 mg atovaquone ( three 250 - mg tablets ) 3 times daily for 21 days and 162 were randomized to receive 320 mg TMP plus 1 , 600 mg SMX 3 times daily for 21 days .
Therapy success was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy .
Improvement in clinical and respiratory measures was assessed using a composite of parameters that included oral body temperature , respiratory rate , severity scores for cough , dyspnea , and chest pain / tightness .
Therapy failures included lack of response , treatment discontinuation due to an adverse experience , and unevaluable .
There was a significant difference ( P = 0 . 03 ) in mortality rates between the treatment groups favoring TMP - SMX .
Among the 322 subjects with confirmed PCP , 13 of 160 ( 8 % ) subjects treated with atovaquone and 4 of 162 ( 2 . 5 % ) subjects receiving TMP - SMX died during the 21 - day treatment course or 8 - week follow - up period .
In the intent - to - treat analysis for all 408 randomized subjects , there were 16 ( 8 % ) deaths among subjects treated with atovaquone and 7 ( 3 . 4 % ) deaths among subjects treated with TMP - SMX ( P = 0 . 051 ) .
Of the 13 subjects with confirmed PCP and treated with atovaquone who died , 4 died of PCP and 5 died with a combination of bacterial infections and PCP ; bacterial infections did not appear to be a factor in any of the 4 deaths among TMP - SMX - treated subjects .
A correlation between plasma atovaquone concentrations and death demonstrated that subjects with lower plasma concentrations were more likely to die .
For those subjects for whom Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentration data are available , 5 ( 63 % ) of 8 subjects with concentrations < 5 mcg / mL died during participation in the trial .
However , only 1 ( 2 % ) of the 49 subjects with Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations ≥ 5 mcg / mL died .
Sixty - two percent of subjects on atovaquone and 64 % of subjects on TMP - SMX were classified as protocol - defined therapy successes ( Table 8 ) .
Table 8 .
Outcome of Treatment for PCP - positive Subjects Enrolled in the TMP - SMX Comparative Trial Outcome of Therapya Number of Subjects ( % ) Atovaquone Tablets ( n = 160 ) TMP - SMX ( n = 162 ) Therapy success 99 62 % 103 64 % Therapy failure due to : - Lack of response - Adverse reaction - Unevaluable 28 11 22 17 % 7 % 14 % 10 33 16 6 % 20 % 10 % Required alternate PCP therapy during trial 55 34 % 55 34 % a As defined by the protocol and described in trial description above .
The failure rate due to lack of response was significantly higher for subjects receiving atovaquone , while the failure rate due to an adverse reaction was significantly higher for subjects receiving TMP - SMX .
Pentamidine Comparative Trial This unblinded , randomized trial was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of atovaquone with that of pentamidine for the treatment of histologically - confirmed mild or moderate PCP in subjects with HIV / AIDS .
Approximately 80 % of the subjects either had a history of intolerance to trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials ( the primary therapy group ) or were experiencing intolerance to TMP - SMX with treatment of an episode of PCP at the time of enrollment in the trial ( the salvage treatment group ) .
A total of 174 subjects were enrolled into the trial .
Subjects were randomized to receive atovaquone 750 mg ( three 250 - mg tablets ) 3 times daily for 21 days or pentamidine isethionate 3 - to 4 - mg / kg single IV infusion daily for 21 days .
The majority of subjects were white ( 72 % ) and male ( 97 % ) ; the mean age was approximately 37 years .
Thirty - nine subjects without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses .
Of the 135 subjects with histologically - confirmed PCP , 70 were randomized to receive atovaquone and 65 to pentamidine .
One hundred and ten ( 110 ) of these were in the primary therapy group and 25 were in the salvage therapy group .
One subject in the primary therapy group randomized to receive pentamidine did not receive trial medication .
There was no difference in mortality rates between the treatment groups .
Among the 135 subjects with confirmed PCP , 10 of 70 ( 14 % ) subjects receiving atovaquone and 9 of 65 ( 14 % ) subjects receiving pentamidine died during the 21 - day treatment course or 8 - week follow - up period .
In the intent - to - treat analysis for all subjects , there were 11 ( 12 . 5 % ) deaths among those treated with atovaquone and 12 ( 14 % ) deaths among those treated with pentamidine .
Among subjects for whom Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations were available , 3 of 5 ( 60 % ) subjects with concentrations < 5 mcg / mL died during participation in the trial .
However , only 2 of 21 ( 9 % ) subjects with Day 4 plasma concentrations ≥ 5 mcg / mL died .
The therapeutic outcomes for the 134 subjects who received trial medication in this trial are presented in Table 9 .
