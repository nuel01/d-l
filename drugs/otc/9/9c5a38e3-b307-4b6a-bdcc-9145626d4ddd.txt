2 . 3 Important Administration Instructions ( a ) BETASERON is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician .
If patients or caregivers are to administer BETASERON , train them in the proper technique for selfadministering subcutaneous injections using the prefilled syringe or the optional injection device .
The BETACONNECT autoinjector has three adjustable injection depth settings ; the healthcare provider should determine the proper depth setting and injection technique .
Use only the syringes in the BETASERON packaging with the BETACONNECT autoinjector .
The initial BETASERON injection should be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare provider .
Users should demonstrate competency in all aspects of the BETASERON injection prior to independent use .
If a patient is to selfadminister BETASERON , the physical and cognitive ability of that patient to selfadminister and properly dispose of syringes should be assessed .
Patients with severe neurological deficits should not selfadminister injections without assistance from a trained caregiver .
Appropriate instruction for selfinjection or injection by another person should be provided to the patient or their caregiver , including careful review of the BETASERON Medication Guide , the prefilled syringe Instructions for Use , and the BETACONNECT autoinjector Instructions for Use that accompanies the product .
( b ) Visually inspect the reconstituted BETASERON solution before use ; discard if it contains particulate matter or is discolored .
( c ) Keeping the syringe and vial adapter in place , turn the assembly over so that the vial is on top .
Withdraw the appropriate dose of BETASERON solution .
Remove the vial from the vial adapter before injecting BETASERON .
( d ) Use safe disposal procedures for needles and syringes .
( e ) Do not re - use needles or syringes .
( f ) Advise patients and caregivers to rotate sites for subcutaneous injections to minimize the likelihood of severe injection site reactions , including necrosis or localized infection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
2 . 4 Premedication for Flu - like Symptoms Concurrent use of analgesics and / or antipyretics on treatment days may help ameliorate flu - like symptoms associated with BETASERON use [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .

History of hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta , albumin or mannitol ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Hepatic Injury : Monitor liver function tests and signs and symptoms of hepatic injury ; consider discontinuing BETASERON if serious hepatic injury occurs .
( 5 . 1 , 5 . 11 ) • • Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic Reactions : Discontinue if anaphylaxis occurs .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Depression and Suicide : Advise patients to immediately report any symptom of depression and / or suicidal ideation ; consider discontinuation of BETASERON if depression occurs .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Congestive Heart Failure ( CHF ) : Monitor patients with CHF for worsening of cardiac symptoms ; consider discontinuation of BETASERON if worsening of CHF occurs .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Injection Site Reactions Including Necrosis : Do not administer BETASERON into affected area until fully healed ; if multiple lesions occur , change injection site or discontinue BETASERON until healing of skin lesions .
( 5 . 5 ) • • Leukopenia : Monitor complete blood count .
( 5 . 6 , 5 . 11 ) • • Thrombotic Microangiopathy : Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) have been reported .
Discontinue BETASERON if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur and a relationship to BETASERON is suspected .
( 5 . 7 ) • • Flu - like Symptom Complex : Consider analgesics and / or antipyretics on injection days .
( 5 . 8 ) • • Drug - induced Lupus Erythematosus : Cases of drug - induced lupus erythematosus have been reported .
Discontinue BETASERON if patients develop new characteristic signs and symptoms .
( 5 . 10 ) 5 . 1 Hepatic Injury Severe hepatic injury including cases of hepatic failure , some of which have been due to autoimmune hepatitis , has been rarely reported in patients taking BETASERON .
In some cases , these events have occurred in the presence of other drugs or comorbid medical conditions that have been associated with hepatic injury .
Consider the potential risk of BETASERON used in combination with known hepatotoxic drugs or other products ( eg , alcohol ) prior to BETASERON administration , or when adding new agents to the regimen of patients already on BETASERON .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury .
Consider discontinuing BETASERON if serum transaminase levels significantly increase , or if they are associated with clinical symptoms such as jaundice .
Asymptomatic elevation of serum transaminases is common in patients treated with BETASERON .
In controlled clinical trials , elevations of SGPT to greater than five times baseline value were reported in 12 % of patients receiving BETASERON ( compared to 4 % on placebo ) , and increases of SGOT to greater than five times baseline value were reported in 4 % of patients receiving BETASERON ( compared to 1 % on placebo ) , leading to dose - reduction or discontinuation of treatment in some patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor liver function tests [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] .
5 . 2 Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic Reactions Anaphylaxis has been reported as a rare complication of BETASERON use .
Other allergic reactions have included dyspnea , bronchospasm , tongue edema , skin rash and urticaria [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Discontinue BETASERON if anaphylaxis occurs .
5 . 3 Depression and Suicide Depression and suicide have been reported to occur with increased frequency in patients receiving interferon beta products , including BETASERON .
Advise patients to report any symptom of depression and / or suicidal ideation to their healthcare provider .
If a patient develops depression , discontinuation of BETASERON therapy should be considered .
In randomized controlled clinical trials , there were three suicides and eight suicide attempts among the 1532 patients on BETASERON compared to one suicide and four suicide attempts among 965 patients on placebo .
5 . 4 Congestive Heart Failure Monitor patients with pre - existing congestive heart failure ( CHF ) for worsening of their cardiac condition during initiation of and continued treatment with BETASERON .
While beta interferons do not have any known direct - acting cardiac toxicity , cases of CHF , cardiomyopathy , and cardiomyopathy with CHF have been reported in patients without known predisposition to these events , and without other known etiologies being established .
In some cases , these events have been temporally related to the administration of BETASERON .
Recurrence upon rechallenge was observed in some patients .
Consider discontinuation of BETASERON if worsening of CHF occurs with no other etiology .
5 . 5 Injection Site Reactions Including Necrosis Injection site reactions , including injection site necrosis , can occur with the use of interferon beta products , including BETASERON .
Injection site necrosis ( ISN ) was reported in 4 % of BETASERON - treated patients in controlled clinical trials ( compared to 0 % on placebo ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Typically , ISN occurs within the first four months of therapy , although postmarketing reports have been received of ISN occurring over one year after initiation of therapy .
The necrotic lesions are typically 3 cm or less in diameter , but larger areas have been reported .
Generally the necrosis has extended only to subcutaneous fat , but has extended to the fascia overlying muscle .
In some lesions where biopsy results are available , vasculitis has been reported .
For some lesions , debridement , and / or skin grafting have been required .
In most cases healing was associated with scarring .
In controlled clinical trials , injection site reactions occurred in 78 % of patients receiving BETASERON with injection site necrosis in 4 % .
Injection site inflammation ( 42 % ) , injection site pain ( 16 % ) , injection site hypersensitivity ( 4 % ) , injection site necrosis ( 4 % ) , injection site mass ( 2 % ) , injection site edema ( 2 % ) , and nonspecific reactions were significantly associated with BETASERON treatment .
The incidence of injection site reactions tended to decrease over time .
Approximately 69 % of patients experienced injection site reactions during the first three months of treatment , compared to approximately 40 % at the end of the studies .
Injection site abscesses and cellulitis have been reported in the postmarketing setting with use of interferon beta products including BETASERON .
Some cases required treatment with hospitalization for surgical drainage and intravenous antibiotics .
Periodically evaluate patient understanding and use of aseptic self - injection techniques and procedures , particularly if injection site necrosis has occurred .
Patients should be advised of the importance of rotating injection sites with each dose .
Whether to discontinue therapy following a single site of necrosis is dependent on the extent of necrosis .
For patients who continue therapy with BETASERON after injection site necrosis has occurred , avoid administration of BETASERON into the affected area until it is fully healed .
If multiple lesions occur , change injection site or discontinue therapy until healing occurs .
5 . 6 Leukopenia In controlled clinical trials , leukopenia was reported in 18 % of patients receiving BETASERON ( compared to 6 % on placebo ) , leading to a reduction of the dose of BETASERON in some patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitoring of complete blood and differential white blood cell counts is recommended .
Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive monitoring of complete blood cell counts , with differential and platelet counts .
5 . 7 Thrombotic Microangiopathy Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) , including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome , some fatal , have been reported with interferon beta products , including BETASERON .
Cases have been reported several weeks to years after starting interferon beta products .
If clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur and a relationship to BETASERON is suspected , discontinue treatment and manage as clinically indicated .
5 . 8 Flu - like Symptom Complex In controlled clinical trials , the rate of flu - like symptom complex for patients on BETASERON was 57 % [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The incidence decreased over time , with 10 % of patients reporting flu - like symptom complex at the end of the studies .
The median duration of flu - like symptom complex in Study 1 was 7 . 5 days [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Analgesics and / or antipyretics on treatment days may help ameliorate flu - like symptoms associated with BETASERON use .
5 . 9 Seizures Seizures have been temporally associated with the use of beta interferons in clinical trials and postmarketing safety surveillance .
It is not known whether these events were related to a primary seizure disorder , the effects of multiple sclerosis alone , the use of beta interferons , other potential precipitants of seizures ( eg , fever ) , or to some combination of these .
5 . 10 Drug - induced Lupus Erythematosus Cases of drug - induced lupus erythematosus have been reported with some interferon beta products , including BETASERON .
Signs and symptoms of drug - induced lupus reported in BETASERON - treated patients have included rash , serositis , polyarthritis , nephritis , and Raynaud ’ s phenomenon .
Cases have occurred with positive serologic testing ( including positive anti - nuclear and / or anti - double - stranded DNA antibody testing ) .
If BETASERON - treated patients develop new signs and symptoms characteristic of this syndrome , BETASERON therapy should be stopped .
5 . 11 Monitoring for Laboratory Abnormalities In addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis , complete blood and differential white blood cell counts , platelet counts and blood chemistries , including liver function tests , are recommended at regular intervals ( one , three , and six months ) following introduction of BETASERON therapy , and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more details in other sections of labeling : • • Hepatic Injury [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Depression and Suicide [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • • Congestive Heart Failure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • • Injection Site Reactions Including Necrosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • • Leukopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • • Thrombotic Microangiopathy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • • Flu - like Symptom Complex [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] • • Seizures [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] • • Drug Induced Lupus Erythematosus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] In controlled clinical trials , the most common adverse reactions ( at least 5 % more frequent on BETASERON than on placebo ) were : injection site reaction , lymphopenia , flu - like symptoms , myalgia , leukopenia , neutropenia , increased liver enzymes , headache , hypertonia , pain , rash , insomnia , abdominal pain , and asthenia .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and over varying lengths of time , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of BETASERON cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of other drugs , and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Among 1407 patients with MS treated with BETASERON 0 . 25 mg every other day ( including 1261 patients treated for greater than one year ) , the most commonly reported adverse reactions ( at least 5 % more frequent on BETASERON than on placebo ) were injection site reaction , lymphopenia , flu - like symptoms , myalgia leukopenia , neutropenia , increased liver enzymes , headache , hypertonia , pain , rash , insomnia , abdominal pain , and asthenia .
The most frequently reported adverse reactions resulting in clinical intervention ( for example , discontinuation of BETASERON , adjustment in dosage , or the need for concomitant medication to treat an adverse reaction symptom ) were depression , flu - like symptom complex , injection site reactions , leukopenia , increased liver enzymes , asthenia , hypertonia , and myasthenia .
Table 2 enumerates adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities that occurred among patients treated with 0 . 25 mg of BETASERON every other day by subcutaneous injection in the pooled placebo - controlled trials ( Study 1 - 4 ) at an incidence that was at least 2 % more than that observed in the placebo - treated patients [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Table 2 : Adverse Reactions and Laboratory Abnormalities in Patients with MS in Pooled Studies 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 Adverse Reaction Placebo ( N = 965 ) BETASERON ( N = 1407 ) Blood and lymphatic system disorders Lymphocytes count decreased ( < 1500 / mm3 ) 66 % 86 % Absolute neutrophil count decreased ( < 1500 / mm3 ) 5 % 13 % White blood cell count decreased ( < 3000 / mm3 ) 4 % 13 % Lymphadenopathy 3 % 6 % Nervous system disorders Headache 43 % 50 % Insomnia 16 % 21 % Incoordination 15 % 17 % Vascular disorders Hypertension 4 % 6 % Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnea 3 % 6 % Gastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain 11 % 16 % Hepatobiliary disorders Alanine aminotransferase increased ( SGPT > 5 times baseline ) 4 % 12 % Aspartate aminotransferase increased ( SGOT > 5 times baseline ) 1 % 4 % Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash 15 % 21 % Skin disorder 8 % 10 % Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Hypertonia 33 % 40 % Myalgia 14 % 23 % Renal and urinary disorders Urinary urgency 8 % 11 % Reproductive system and breast disorders Metrorrhagia 7 % 9 % Impotence 6 % 8 % General disorders and administration site conditions Injection site reaction [ 1 ] 26 % 78 % Asthenia 48 % 53 % Flu - like symptoms ( complex ) [ 2 ] 37 % 57 % Pain 35 % 42 % Fever 19 % 31 % Chills 9 % 21 % Peripheral edema 10 % 12 % Chest pain 6 % 9 % Malaise 3 % 6 % Injection site necrosis 0 % 4 % [ 1 ] " Injection site reaction " comprises all adverse reactions occurring at the injection site ( except injection site necrosis ) , that is , the following terms : injection site reaction , injection site hemorrhage , injection site hypersensitivity , injection site inflammation , injection site mass , injection site pain , injection site edema and injection site atrophy .
[ 2 ] " Flu - like symptom ( complex ) " denotes flu syndrome and / or a combination of at least two adverse reactions from fever , chills , myalgia , malaise , sweating .
In addition to the Adverse Reactions listed in Table 2 , the following adverse reactions occurred more frequently on BETASERON than on placebo , but with a difference smaller than 2 % : alopecia , anxiety , arthralgia , constipation , diarrhea , dizziness , dyspepsia , dysmenorrhea , leg cramps , menorrhagia , myasthenia , nausea , nervousness , palpitations , peripheral vascular disorder , prostatic disorder , tachycardia , urinary frequency , vasodilatation , and weight increase .
Laboratory Abnormalities In the four clinical trials ( Studies 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , leukopenia was reported in 18 % and 6 % of patients in BETASERON - and placebo - treated groups , respectively .
No patients were withdrawn or dose reduced for neutropenia in Study 1 .
Three percent ( 3 % ) of patients in Studies 2 and 3 experienced leukopenia and were dose - reduced .
Other abnormalities included increase of SGPT to greater than five times baseline value ( 12 % ) , and increase of SGOT to greater than five times baseline value ( 4 % ) .
In Study 1 , two patients were dose reduced for increased hepatic enzymes ; one continued on treatment and one was ultimately withdrawn .
In Studies 2 and 3 , 1 . 5 % of BETASERON patients were dose - reduced or interrupted treatment for increased hepatic enzymes .
In Study 4 , 1 . 7 % of patients were withdrawn from treatment due to increased hepatic enzymes , two of them after a dose reduction .
In Studies 1 - 4 , nine ( 0 . 6 % ) patients were withdrawn from treatment with BETASERON for any laboratory abnormality , including four ( 0 . 3 % ) patients following dose reduction .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for immunogenicity .
Serum samples were monitored for the development of antibodies to BETASERON during Study 1 .
In patients receiving 0 . 25 mg every other day 56 / 124 ( 45 % ) were found to have serum neutralizing activity at one or more of the time points tested .
In Study 4 , neutralizing activity was measured every 6 months and at end of study .
At individual visits after start of therapy , activity was observed in 17 % up to 25 % of the BETASERON - treated patients .
Such neutralizing activity was measured at least once in 75 ( 30 % ) out of 251 BETASERON patients who provided samples during treatment phase ; of these , 17 ( 23 % ) converted to negative status later in the study .
Based on all the available evidence , the relationship between antibody formation and clinical safety or efficacy is not known .
These data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to BETASERON using a biological neutralization assay that measures the ability of immune sera to inhibit the production of the interferon - inducible protein , MxA .
Neutralization assays are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of neutralizing activity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to BETASERON with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading .
Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with the use of BETASERON [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of BETASERON .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Anemia , Thrombocytopenia , Hemolytic anemia Endocrine disorders : Hypothyroidism , Hyperthyroidism , Thyroid dysfunction Metabolism and nutrition disorders : Triglyceride increased , Anorexia , Weight decrease , Weight increase Psychiatric disorders : Anxiety , Confusion , Emotional lability Nervous system disorders : Convulsion , Dizziness , Psychotic symptoms Cardiac disorders : Cardiomyopathy , Palpitations , Tachycardia Vascular disorders : Vasodilatation Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Bronchospasm Gastrointestinal disorders : Diarrhea , Nausea , Pancreatitis , Vomiting Hepatobiliary disorders : Hepatitis , Gamma GT increased Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Alopecia , Pruritus , Skin discoloration , Urticaria Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : Arthralgia Reproductive system and breast disorder : Menorrhagia General disorders and administration site conditions : Fatal capillary leak syndrome1 1 The administration of cytokines to patients with a pre - existing monoclonal gammopathy has been associated with the development of this syndrome .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Although there have been no well - controlled studies in pregnant women , available data , which includes prospective observational studies , have not generally indicated a drug - associated risk of major birth defects with interferon beta - 1 b during pregnancy .
Administration of BETASERON to monkeys during gestation resulted in increased embryo - fetal death at or above exposures greater than 3 times the human therapeutic dose ( see Animal Data ) .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
Data Human Data The majority of the observational studies reporting on pregnancies exposed to interferon beta - 1 b did not identify an association between the use of interferon beta - 1 b during pregnancy and an increased risk of major birth defects .
Animal Data When BETASERON ( doses ranging from 0 . 028 to 0 . 42 mg / kg / day ) was administered to pregnant rhesus monkeys throughout the period of organogenesis ( gestation days 20 to 70 ) , a dose - related abortifacient effect was observed .
The low - effect dose is approximately 3 times the recommended human dose of 0 . 25 mg on a body surface area ( mg / m2 ) basis .
A no - effect dose for embryo - fetal developmental toxicity in rhesus monkeys was not established .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of BETASERON in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects of the drug on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for BETASERON and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BETASERON or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BETASERON did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION Interferon beta - 1 b is a purified , sterile , lyophilized protein product produced by recombinant DNA techniques .
Interferon beta - 1 b is manufactured by bacterial fermentation of a strain of Escherichia coli that bears a genetically engineered plasmid containing the gene for human interferon betaser17 .
The native gene was obtained from human fibroblasts and altered in a way that substitutes serine for the cysteine residue found at position 17 .
Interferon beta - 1 b has 165 amino acids and an approximate molecular weight of 18 , 500 daltons .
It does not include the carbohydrate side chains found in the natural material .
The specific activity of BETASERON is approximately 32 million international units ( IU ) / mg interferon beta - 1 b .
Each vial contains 0 . 3 mg of interferon beta - 1 b .
The unit measurement is derived by comparing the antiviral activity of the product to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) reference standard of recombinant human interferon beta .
Mannitol , USP and Albumin ( Human ) , USP ( 15 mg each / vial ) are added as stabilizers .
Lyophilized BETASERON is a sterile , white to off - white powder , for subcutaneous injection after reconstitution with the diluent supplied ( Sodium Chloride , 0 . 54 % Solution ) .
Albumin ( Human ) USP and Mannitol , USP ( 15 mg each / vial ) are added as stabilizers .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of BETASERON ( interferon beta - 1 b ) in patients with multiple sclerosis is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Interferons ( IFNs ) are a family of naturally occurring proteins , produced by eukaryotic cells in response to viral infection and other biologic agents .
Three major types of interferons have been defined : type 1 ( IFN - alpha , beta , epsilon , kappa and omega ) , type II ( IFN – gamma ) and type III ( IFN - lambda ) .
Interferon - beta is a member of the type I subset of interferons .
The type I interferons have considerably overlapping but also distinct biologic activities .
The bioactivities of all IFNs , including IFN - beta , are induced via their binding to specific receptors on the membranes of human cells .
Differences in the bioactivities induced by the three major subtypes of IFNs likely reflect differences in the signal transduction pathways induced by signaling through their cognate receptors .
Interferon beta - 1 b receptor binding induces the expression of proteins that are responsible for the pleiotropic bioactivities of interferon beta - 1 b .
A number of these proteins ( including neopterin , β2 - microglobulin , MxA protein , and IL - 10 ) have been measured in blood fractions from BETASERON - treated patients and BETASERON - treated healthy volunteers .
Immunomodulatory effects of interferon beta - 1 b include the enhancement of suppressor T cell activity , reduction of pro - inflammatory cytokine production , down - regulation of antigen presentation , and inhibition of lymphocyte trafficking into the central nervous system .
It is not known if these effects play an important role in the observed clinical activity of BETASERON in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Because serum concentrations of interferon beta - 1 b are low or not detectable following subcutaneous administration of 0 . 25 mg or less of BETASERON , pharmacokinetic information in patients with MS receiving the recommended dose of BETASERON is not available .
Following single and multiple daily subcutaneous administrations of 0 . 5 mg BETASERON to healthy volunteers ( N = 12 ) , serum interferon beta - 1 b concentrations were generally below 100 IU / mL .
Peak serum interferon beta - 1 b concentrations occurred between one to eight hours , with a mean peak serum interferon concentration of 40 IU / mL .
Bioavailability , based on a total dose of 0 . 5 mg BETASERON given as two subcutaneous injections at different sites , was approximately 50 % .
After intravenous administration of BETASERON ( 0 . 006 mg to 2 mg ) , similar pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained from healthy volunteers ( N = 12 ) and from patients with diseases other than MS ( N = 142 ) .
In patients receiving single intravenous doses up to 2 mg , increases in serum concentrations were dose proportional .
Mean serum clearance values ranged from 9 . 4 mL / min • kg - 1 to 28 . 9 mL / min • kg - 1 and were independent of dose .
Mean terminal elimination half - life values ranged from 8 minutes to 4 . 3 hours and mean steady - state volume of distribution values ranged from 0 . 25 L / kg to 2 . 88 L / kg .
Three - times - a - week intravenous dosing for two weeks resulted in no accumulation of interferon beta - 1 b in sera of patients .
Pharmacokinetic parameters after single and multiple intravenous doses of BETASERON were comparable .
Following every other day subcutaneous administration of 0 . 25 mg BETASERON in healthy volunteers , biologic response marker levels ( neopterin , β2 - microglobulin , MxA protein , and the immunosuppressive cytokine , IL - 10 ) increased significantly above baseline six - twelve hours after the first BETASERON dose .
Biologic response marker levels peaked between 40 and 124 hours and remained elevated above baseline throughout the seven - day ( 168 - hour ) study .
The relationship between serum interferon beta - 1 b levels or induced biologic response marker levels and the clinical effects of interferon beta - 1 b in multiple sclerosis is unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with BETASERON .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis BETASERON has not been tested for its carcinogenic potential in animals .
Mutagenesis BETASERON was not genotoxic in the in vitro Ames bacterial test or the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes .
BETASERON treatment of mouse BALBc - 3T3 cells did not result in increased transformation frequency in an in vitro model of tumor transformation .
Impairment of Fertility Administration of BETASERON ( doses of up to 0 . 33 mg / kg / day ) to normally cycling female rhesus monkeys had no apparent adverse effects on either menstrual cycle duration or associated hormonal profiles ( progesterone and estradiol ) when administered over three consecutive menstrual cycles .
The highest dose tested is approximately 30 times the recommended human dose of 0 . 25 mg on a body surface area ( mg / m2 ) basis .
The potential for other effects on fertility or reproductive performance was not evaluated .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The clinical effects of BETASERON were studied in four randomized , multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis ( Studies 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) .
Patients with Relapsing - Remitting Multiple Sclerosis The effectiveness of BETASERON in relapsing - remitting MS ( RRMS ) was evaluated in a double - blind , multiclinic , randomized , parallel , placebo controlled clinical study of two years duration ( Study 1 ) .
The study enrolled MS patients , aged 18 to 50 , who were ambulatory [ Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) of ≤ 5 . 5 – score 5 . 5 is ambulatory for 100 meters , disability precludes full daily activities ] , exhibited a relapsing - remitting clinical course , met Poser ’ s criteria for clinically definite and / or laboratory supported definite MS and had experienced at least two exacerbations over two years preceding the trial without exacerbation in the preceding month .
The EDSS score is a method of quantifying disability in patients with MS and ranges from 0 ( normal neurologic exam ) to 10 ( death due to MS ) .
Patients who had received prior immunosuppressant therapy were excluded .
An exacerbation was defined as the appearance of a new clinical sign / symptom or the clinical worsening of a previous sign / symptom ( one that had been stable for at least 30 days ) that persisted for a minimum of 24 hours .
Patients selected for study were randomized to treatment with either placebo ( N = 123 ) , 0 . 05 mg of BETASERON ( N = 125 ) , or 0 . 25 mg of BETASERON ( N = 124 ) self - administered subcutaneously every other day .
Outcome based on the 372 randomized patients was evaluated after two years .
Patients who required more than three 28 - day courses of corticosteroids were removed from the study .
Minor analgesics ( acetaminophen , codeine ) , antidepressants , and oral baclofen were allowed ad libitum , but chronic nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) use was not allowed .
The primary protocol - defined outcome measures were 1 ) frequency of exacerbations per patient and 2 ) proportion of exacerbation free patients .
A number of secondary clinical and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measures were also employed .
All patients underwent annual T2 MRI imaging and a subset of 52 patients at one site had MRIs performed every six weeks for assessment of new or expanding lesions .
The study results are shown in Table 3 .

These patients are excluded from this analysis .
[ 2 ] Sequelae and Functional Neurologic Status , both required by protocol , were not analyzed individually but are included as a function of the EDSS .
[ 3 ] EDSS scores range from 1 - 10 , with higher scores reflecting greater disability .
[ 4 ] Scripps neurologic rating scores range from 0 - 100 , with smaller scores reflecting greater disability .
[ 5 ] ND = Not done .
Of the 372 RRMS patients randomized , 72 ( 19 % ) failed to complete two full years on their assigned treatments .
Over the two - year period in Study 1 , there were 25 MS - related hospitalizations in the 0 . 25 mg BETASERON - treated group compared to 48 hospitalizations in the placebo group .
In comparison , non - MS hospitalizations were evenly distributed among the groups , with 16 in the 0 . 25 mg BETASERON group and 15 in the placebo group .
The average number of days of MS - related steroid use was 41 days in the 0 . 25 mg BETASERON group and 55 days in the placebo group ( p = 0 . 004 ) .
MRI data were also analyzed for patients in this study .
A frequency distribution of the observed percent changes in MRI area at the end of two years was obtained by grouping the percentages in successive intervals of equal width .
Figure 1 displays a histogram of the proportions of patients , which fell into each of these intervals .
The median percent change in MRI area for the 0 . 25 mg group was - 1 . 1 % , which was significantly smaller than the 16 . 5 % observed for the placebo group ( p = 0 . 0001 ) .
Figure 1 : Distribution of Change in MRI Area in Patients with RRMS in Study 1 [ MULTIMEDIA ] In an evaluation of frequent MRI scans ( every six weeks ) on 52 patients at one site in Study 1 , the percent of scans with new or expanding lesions was 29 % in the placebo group and 6 % in the 0 . 25 mg treatment group ( p = 0 . 006 ) .
Patients with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Studies 2 and 3 were multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo controlled trials conducted to assess the effect of BETASERON in patients with secondary progressive MS ( SPMS ) .
Study 2 was conducted in Europe and Study 3 was conducted in North America .
Both studies enrolled patients with clinically definite or laboratory - supported MS in the secondary progressive phase , and who had evidence of disability progression ( both Study 2 and 3 ) or two relapses ( Study 2 only ) within the previous two years .
Baseline Kurtzke expanded disability status scale ( EDSS ) scores ranged from 3 . 0 to 6 . 5 .
Patients in Study 2 were randomized to receive BETASERON 0 . 25 mg ( N = 360 ) or placebo ( N = 358 ) .
Patients in Study 3 were randomized to BETASERON 0 . 25 mg ( N = 317 ) , BETASERON 0 . 16 mg / m2 of body surface area ( N = 314 , mean assigned dose 0 . 3 mg ) , or placebo ( N = 308 ) .
Test agents were administered subcutaneously , every other day for three years .
The primary outcome measure was progression of disability , defined as a 1 . 0 point increase in the EDSS score , or a 0 . 5 point increase for patients with baseline EDSS ≥ 6 . 0 .
In Study 2 , time to progression in EDSS was longer in the BETASERON treatment group ( p = 0 . 005 ) , with estimated annualized rates of progression of 16 % and 19 % in the BETASERON and placebo groups , respectively .
In Study 3 , the rates of progression did not differ significantly between treatment groups , with estimated annualized rates of progression of 12 % , 14 % , and 12 % in the BETASERON fixed dose , surface area - adjusted dose , and placebo groups , respectively .
Multiple analyses , including covariate and subset analyses based on sex , age , disease duration , clinical disease activity prior to study enrollment , MRI measures at baseline and early changes in MRI following treatment were evaluated in order to interpret the discordant study results .
No demographic or disease - related factors enabled identification of a patient subset where BETASERON treatment was predictably associated with delayed progression of disability .
In Studies 2 and 3 , like Study 1 , a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of relapses associated with BETASERON treatment was demonstrated .
In Study 2 , the mean annual relapse rates were 0 . 42 and 0 . 63 in the BETASERON and placebo groups , respectively ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
In Study 3 , the mean annual relapse rates were 0 . 16 , 0 . 20 , and 0 . 28 , for the fixed dose , surface area - adjusted dose , and placebo groups , respectively ( p < 0 . 02 ) .
MRI endpoints in both Study 2 and Study 3 showed smaller increases in T2 MRI lesion area and decreased number of active MRI lesions in patients in the BETASERON groups compared to the placebo group .
Patients with an Isolated Demyelinating Event and Typical MS Lesions on Brain MRI In Study 4 , 468 patients who had recently ( within 60 days ) experienced an isolated demyelinating event , and who had lesions typical of multiple sclerosis on brain MRI were randomized to receive either 0 . 25 mg BETASERON ( N = 292 ) or placebo ( N = 176 ) subcutaneously every other day ( ratio 5 : 3 ) .
The primary outcome measure was time to development of a second exacerbation with involvement of at least two distinct anatomical regions .
Secondary outcomes were brain MRI measures , including the cumulative number of newly active lesions , and the absolute change in T2 lesion volume .
Patients were followed for up to two years or until they fulfilled the primary endpoint .
Eight percent of subjects on BETASERON and 6 % of subjects on placebo withdrew from the study for a reason other than the development of a second exacerbation .
Time to development of a second exacerbation was significantly delayed in patients treated with BETASERON compared to patients treated with placebo ( p < 0 . 0001 ) .
The Kaplan - Meier estimates of the percentage of patients developing an exacerbation within 24 months were 45 % in the placebo group and 28 % of the BETASERON group ( Figure 2 ) .
The risk for developing a second exacerbation in the BETASERON group was 53 % of the risk in the placebo group ( Hazard ratio = 0 . 53 ; 95 % confidence interval 0 . 39 to 0 . 73 ) .
Figure 2 : Onset of Second Exacerbation by Time in Patients with Isolated Demyelinating Event with Typical MS Lesions on Brain MRI in Study 4 * [ MULTIMEDIA ] In Study 4 , patients treated with BETASERON demonstrated a lower number of newly active lesions during the course of the study .
A significant difference between BETASERON and placebo was not seen in the absolute change in T2 lesion volume during the course of the study .

Supplies needed for your BETASERON Injection ( See Figure A ) .
• • 1 single - dose carton containing : • oA vial of BETASERON • oA pre - filled diluent syringe • oA vial adapter with a 30 - gauge needle attached ( in the blister pack ) • o2 alcohol prep pads [ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 1 : Preparing for Your BETASERON Injection • • Place the supplies you will need on a clean , flat surface in a well - lit area .
• • Check the expiration date on the single - dose carton to make sure that it has not expired .
Do not use it if the medication has expired .
• • Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water .
• • Open the single - dose carton and take out all the contents .
Make sure the blister pack containing the vial adapter is sealed .
Check to make sure the plastic cap on the pre - filled diluent syringe is firmly attached .
• • Remove the tray from the single - dose carton and place it on a flat surface .
• • Place the BETASERON vial in the well ( vial holder ) and place the pre - filled diluent syringe in the U - shaped trough ( See Figure B ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 2 : Mixing BETASERON • • Remove the BETASERON vial from the well ( vial holder ) and take the cap off the vial .
• • Place the vial back into the well ( vial holder ) .
• • Use an alcohol prep pad to clean the top of the vial .
Move the alcohol prep pad in 1 direction .
Leave the alcohol prep pad on top of the vial .
• • Peel the label off the blister pack with the vial adapter in it .
The vial adapter is sterile .
Do not remove or touch the vial adapter .
• • Remove the alcohol prep pad from the top of the BETASERON vial .
Pick up the vial adapter in the blister pack .
Turn over the blister pack keeping the vial adapter inside .
Put the adapter on top of the BETASERON vial .
Push down on the adapter until it pierces the rubber top of the BETASERON vial and snaps in place ( See Figure C ) .
Remove the blister packaging from the vial adapter .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • • Twist the plastic cap from the pre - filled diluent syringe .
Throw away the plastic cap ( See Figure D ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • • Keep the vial adapter attached to the vial and remove the vial from the well ( vial holder ) .
Be careful not to pull the vial adapter off the top of the vial .
• • Connect the pre - filled diluent syringe to the vial adapter by turning clockwise until resistance is felt and the attachment is secure .
This forms the syringe assembly ( See Figure E ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • • Slowly push the plunger of the pre - filled diluent syringe all the way in .
This will transfer all of the liquid from the syringe into the BETASERON vial ( See Figure F ) .
The plunger may return to its original position after you release it .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • • Gently swirl the vial to completely dissolve the white powder of BETASERON .
Do not shake .
Shaking and even gentle mixing can cause foaming of the medicine .
If there is foam , let the vial sit until the foam settles before using it .
• • After the powder dissolves , look closely at the solution in the vial .
Do not use the solution if it is cloudy or contains particles .
It should be clear and colorless .
• • Do not use cracked or damaged BETASERON vials .
If your vial is cracked or damaged , get a new single - dose carton containing a BETASERON vial , pre - filled diluent syringe , vial adapter and 2 alcohol prep pads .
Repeat the steps to prepare your BETASERON dose .
• • Contact BETAPLUS , the BETASERON patient support program , at 1 - 800 - 788 - 1467 to obtain a replacement product .
Step 3 : Preparing the Injection You have completed the steps to prepare your BETASERON and are ready for the injection .
The injection should be given immediately after mixing and allowing any foam in the solution to settle .
If you must wait to give yourself the injection , you may refrigerate the solution and use within 3 hours of mixing your BETASERON .
Do not freeze .
• • Push the plunger in and hold it there ; then turn the syringe assembly so that the syringe is horizontal and the vial is on top .
• • Slowly pull the plunger back to withdraw all the liquid from the BETASERON vial into the syringe ( See Figure G ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • • NOTE : The syringe barrel is marked with numbers from 0 . 25 mL to 1 mL ( See Figure H ) .
If the solution in the vial cannot be drawn up to the 1 mL mark , discard the vial and syringe and start over with a new single - dose carton containing a BETASERON vial , pre - filled diluent syringe , vial adapter and alcohol prep pads .
• • Turn the syringe assembly so that the needle end is pointing up .
Remove any air bubbles by tapping the outside of the syringe with your fingers .
Slowly push the plunger to the 1 mL mark on the syringe or to the mark that matches the amount of BETASERON prescribed by your healthcare provider ( See Figure H ) .
If too much solution is pushed into the vial , repeat Step 3 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • • Turn the syringe assembly so that the vial is at the bottom .
Remove the vial adapter and the vial from the syringe by twisting the vial adapter .
This will remove the vial adapter and the vial from the syringe , but will leave the needle on the syringe ( See Figure I ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 4 : Choosing an Injection Site • • BETASERON ( interferon beta - 1 b ) is injected under the skin and into the fat layer between the skin and the muscles ( subcutaneous tissue ) .
The best areas for injection are where the skin is loose and soft and away from the joints , nerves , and bones .
Do not use the area near your navel or waistline .
If you are very thin , use only the thigh or outer surface of the arm for injection .
• • Choose a different site each time you give yourself an injection .
Figure J shows different areas for giving injections .
Do not inject in the same area for 2 injections in a row .
Keep a record of your injections to help make sure you change ( rotate ) your injection sites .
You should decide where you will inject BETASERON before you prepare your medicine for injection .
If there are any sites that are difficult for you to reach , you can ask someone who has been trained to give the injection to help you .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • • Do not inject BETASERON in a site where the skin is red , bruised , infected , or scabbed , has broken open , or has lumps , bumps , or pain .
Tell your healthcare provider if you find skin conditions like the ones mentioned here or any other unusual - looking areas where you have been given injections .
• Step 5 : Injecting BETASERON [ MULTIMEDIA ] • • Slowly push the plunger all the way in until the syringe is empty ( See Figure L ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • • Remove the needle from the skin .
Place a dry cotton ball or gauze pad over the injection site .
Gently massage the injection site for a few moments with the dry cotton ball or gauze pad .
Throw away the syringe in your puncture - proof disposal container .
• • Optional Use of BETACONNECT Autoinjector : You may also give BETASERON by using the BETACONNECT autoinjector .
You should get help with training on the use of the BETACONNECT autoinjector from a healthcare provider before using it for the first time .
The BETACONNECT autoinjector should only be used with the syringes that come in the BETASERON packaging .
See the Instructions for Use that come with the BETACONNECT autoinjector .
