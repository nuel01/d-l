2 .
Clamp donor tubing between Donor Care ® Needle Guard ( DCNG ) and Y Sampling Site .
3 .
Secure donor tubing above the Y connector and disinfect site of phlebotomy .
4 .
If using blood pressure cuff , inflate to not more than 60 mm Hg .
5 .
Remove donor needle cover and accomplish phlebotomy .
6 .
Release clamp and ensure there is blood flow .
Reduce pressure as required .
7 .
Slide the DCNG midway over the needle hub and securely tape DCNG to the donor ' s arm as close to the top of the DCNG as possible .
Note : If blood flow is slow , slide DCNG away from the needle hub , adjust and re - engage DCNG .
If repeated needle adjustment is necessary , slide DCNG away from the needle hub and re - engage at the end of blood collection .
8 .
Collect appropriate volume of blood into collection bag , as indicated on packaging .
Note : Mix blood and anticoagulant frequently during collection , for example , once every 45 seconds , and immediately after collection .
If blood agitation device is used , follow manufacturer ' s operating instructions .
9 .
After required amount of blood has been collected , seal donor tubing between Y Sampling Site and collection bag .
Note : If pre - filtration quality control is to be performed , leave an adequate length ( ~ 10 inches ) of QC tubing containing anticoagulated blood attached to the collection bag .
10 .
For blood sampling , remove the Y Sampling Site needle cover .
Ensure the protective sheath is in place over the sampling needle .

13 .
Ensure the vacuum tubes are centered within the vacuum tube holder .
14 .
Maintain forward pressure on the vacuum tubes during sample collection .
Note : After the last tube is collected , it is recommended that the vacuum tube holder be left in place .
15 .
After blood samples are collected , clamp donor tubing between the Y Sampling Site and as close to the DCNG as possible .
16 .
Release any remaining pressure from the donor ' s arm .
17 .
DCNG must be held stationary while the needle is withdrawn into it .
While holding sides of DCNG near the front , grasp the tubing below the clamp and pull the needle into the DCNG until it locks into place , and the needle hub engages the bottom of the DCNG .

8 .
The donor blood will be automatically diverted to the sample diversion pouch .
Once the sample diversion pouch is filled , close clamp immediately on tubing between the sample diversion pouch and Y connector .
Warning : To avoid risk of air embolism to donor , do not squeeze sample diversion pouch while tubing is open .
9 .
Open snap - open closure between the Y connector and the collection bag to initiate blood collection .
Reduce pressure as needed .
10 .

Continue to " Filtration Instructions ” , Step 1 .
WHEN USING SYSTEMS WITH A PRE - ATTACHED SAMP LOK VACUUM TUBE HOLDER 1 .
To collect blood samples , open lid from Samp Lok vacuum tube holder .
2 .
Open snap - open closure between sample diversion pouch and Samp Lok vacuum tube holder .
3 .
Position the sample diversion pouch downwards so that the air rises to the top of the pouch and away from the Samp Lok vacuum tube holder .
Note : Drawing air into the vacuum tube may cause hemolysis .
4 .
Collect blood samples from the sample diversion pouch into vacuum tubes within approximately four minutes to avoid possible clot formation .
5 .
Ensure the vacuum tubes are centered within the Samp Lok vacuum tube holder during sample collection .
6 .
Maintain forward pressure on the vacuum tubes during sample collection .
7 .
The lid may be closed on the Samp Lok vacuum tube holder after sample collection .
8 .
Return to “ Blood Collection Instruction for Systems Containing a Sample Diversion Pouch with or without a Pre - attached Samp Lok Vacuum Tube Holder ” , Step 17 .
Note : When collection of unit is complete , and the donor needle is engaged in the DCNG , open the lid of the Samp Lok vacuum tube holder and insert the DCNG into the holder .
Twist until it locks into place .
An audible click will confirm that it is locked .
FILTRATION INSTRUCTION 1 .
Filter and process whole blood within 72 hours of collection .
2 .
Mix whole blood / anticoagulant thoroughly .
3 .
Place empty red cell storage bag on a horizontal surface .
4 .
Ensure cap of blood recovery vent above the filter is tightly closed .
5 .
Hang whole blood bag up to 60 inches ( 1 . 52 meters ) above empty red cell storage bag and ensure filter is vertical .
Note : The maximum head height should be 60 inches ( 1 . 52 meters ) for whole blood filtered at room temperature and at 1 — 6 ° C . 6 .
Open snap - open closure of whole blood bag .
Priming will occur automatically by gravity .
7 .
After blood fills one side of the air vent below the filter , open snap - open closure immediately below the air vent to begin filtration .
8 .
Allow blood to filter by gravity .
Note : Do not apply mechanical or manual pressure to increase flow rate .
Filtration is complete when whole blood bag is empty .
9 .
Remove cap from blood recovery vent above the filter and allow the upstream side ( non - printed side ) of the filter to drain .
10 .
When the upstream side of the filter is empty , clamp tubing below the filter .
Note : Filtration times can be influenced by collection and processing conditions and biological variability of donors .
Experimental data with some filter products indicate that a prolonged filtration can be an indication of sub - optimal leukocyte reduction .
11 .
Seal tubing just below the snap - open closure .
12 .
Detach and discard collection bag and filter .
Note : Do not strip tubing prior to sealing the tubing distal to the filter .
If it is desired to strip blood from numbered tubing , do so only after tubing has been sealed close to the snap - open closure and detached .
13 .
If desired , seal at or adjacent to " X ” marks on the tubing to provide numbered segments of anticoagulated blood for typing or crossmatching .
Notes : If it is necessary to strip blood from numbered tubing for re - suspension , care should be taken when stripping is performed .
Increased ( mechanical ) hemolysis has been associated with stripping when blood is cold and has a higher hematocrit .
Do not strip forcefully or frequently against a snap - open closure .
PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS 1 .
Load filtered blood and remaining bags into centrifuge cup , ensuring that the tubing stays in the top half of the cup .
2 .
Centrifuge at appropriate conditions to produce desired components .
3 .
Carefully remove the unit from the centrifuge and place the red cell storage bag in the plasma expressor .
4 .
Clamp tubing to extra satellite bags , if present .
5 .
Gently apply expressor pressure .
6 .
Open snap - open closure to satellite bag and express plasma .
7 .
After plasma is expressed , clamp tubing between red cell storage bag and Y connector , and release expressor pressure .
8 .
Clamp tubing between the Y connector and plasma bag .
9 .
Hang AS - 3 bag above red cell storage bag and remove clamp from tubing to the red cell storage bag .
10 .
Open snap - open closure on the bag containing the AS - 3 additive solution and transfer to the bag containing the red cells .
Note : AS - 3 solution should be added to the packed red blood cells immediately after removal of plasma .
Transfer AS - 3 solution under one of the following processing conditions : a . within 8 hours of collection if whole blood is held at room temperature .
b . within 72 hours of collection if whole blood is refrigerated .
11 .
Seal tubing and detach the bag containing packed red cells , and set aside plasma for further processing .
** Note : If quality control is to be performed on postfiltration sample , leave an adequate length ( ~ 10 inches ) of tubing attached to the bag containing red cells .
12 .
Gently mix packed red cells and AS - 3 solution .
13 .
Store CP2D / AS - 3 preserved red blood cells at 1 — 6 ° C for up to 42 days and use as indicated .
Note : If AS - 3 is not used , whole blood or red blood cells in CP2D alone may be stored at 1 — 6 ° C for up to 21 days .
