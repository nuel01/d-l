FURTHER DILUTION IS REQUIRED .
NOT FOR DIRECT INFUSION .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : After intramuscular administration of Cefazolin for Injection to normal volunteers , the mean serum concentrations were 37 mcg / mL at 1 hour and 3 mcg / mL at 8 hours following a 500 mg dose , and 64 mcg / mL at 1 hour and 7 mcg / mL at 8 hours following a 1 gram dose .
Studies have shown that following intravenous administration of Cefazolin for Injection to normal volunteers , mean serum concentrations peaked at approximately 185 mcg / mL and were approximately 4 mcg / mL at 8 hours for a 1 - gram dose .
The serum half - life for Cefazolin for Injection is approximately 1 . 8 hours following I . V . administration .
In a study ( using normal volunteers ) of constant intravenous infusion with dosages of 3 . 5 mg / kg for 1 hour ( approximately 250 mg ) and 1 . 5 mg / kg the next 2 hours ( approximately 100 mg ) , Cefazolin for Injection produced a steady serum level at the third hour of approximately 28 mcg / mL .
Studies in patients hospitalized with infections indicate that Cefazolin for Injection produces mean peak serum levels approximately equivalent to those seen in normal volunteers .
Bile levels in patients without obstructive biliary disease can reach or exceed serum levels by up to 5 times ; however , in patients with obstructive biliary disease , bile levels of Cefazolin for Injection are considerably lower than serum levels ( less than 1 mcg / mL ) .
In synovial fluid , the level of Cefazolin for Injection becomes comparable to that reached in serum at about 4 hours after drug administration .
Studies of cord blood show prompt transfer of Cefazolin for Injection across the placenta .
Cefazolin for Injection is present in very low concentrations in the milk of nursing mothers .
Cefazolin for Injection is excreted unchanged in the urine .
In the first 6 hours approximately 60 % of the drug is excreted in the urine and this increases to 70 % to 80 % within 24 hours .
Cefazolin for Injection achieves peak urine concentrations of approximately 2 , 400 mcg / mL and 4 , 000 mcg / mL respectively following 500 mg and 1 gram intramuscular doses .
In patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis ( 2 L / hr . )
, Cefazolin for Injection produced mean serum levels of approximately 10 and 30 mcg / mL after 24 hours ' instillation of a dialyzing solution containing 50 mg / L and 150 mg / L , respectively .
Mean peak levels were 29 mcg / mL ( range 13 to 44 mcg / mL ) with 50 mg / L ( 3 patients ) , and 72 mcg / mL ( range 26 to 142 mcg / mL ) with 150 mg / L ( 6 patients ) .
Intraperitoneal administration of Cefazolin for Injection is usually well tolerated .
Controlled studies on adult normal volunteers , receiving 1 gram 4 times a day for 10 days , monitoring CBC , SGOT , SGPT , bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , BUN , creatinine , and urinalysis , indicated no clinically significant changes attributed to Cefazolin for Injection .
Microbiology Mechanism of Action Cefazolin is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis .
Resistance Predominant mechanisms of bacterial resistance to cephalosporins include the presence of extended - spectrum beta - lactamases and enzymatic hydrolysis .
Antimicrobial Activity Cefazolin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section .
• Gram - Positive Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Methicillin - resistant staphylococci are uniformly resistant to cefazolin .
• Gram - Negative Bacteria Escherichia coli Proteus mirabilis Most isolates of indole positive Proteus ( Proteus vulgaris ) , Enterobacter spp . , Morganella morganii , Providencia rettgeri , Serratia spp . , and Pseudomonas spp .
are resistant to cefazolin .
Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug , please see : https : / / www . fda . gov / STIC .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE : Cefazolin for Injection , USP is indicated for the treatment of the following serious infections due to susceptible organisms .
Respiratory Tract Infections : Due to S . pneumoniae , Klebsiella species , H . influenzae , S . aureus ( penicillin - sensitive and penicillin - resistant ) , and group A beta - hemolytic streptococci .
Injectable benzathine penicillin is considered the drug of choice in treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections , including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever .
Cefazolin for Injection , USP is effective in the eradication of streptococci from the nasopharynx ; however , data establishing the efficacy of Cefazolin for Injection , USP in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available at present .
Urinary Tract Infections : Due to E . coli , P . mirabilis , Klebsiella species , and some strains of enterobacter and enterococci .
Skin and Skin Structure Infections : Due to S . aureus ( penicillin - sensitive and penicillin - resistant ) , group A beta - hemolytic streptococci , and other strains of streptococci .
Biliary Tract Infections : Due to E . coli , various strains of streptococci , P . mirabilis , Klebsiella species , and S . aureus .
Bone and Joint Infections : Due to S . aureus .
Genital Infections : ( i . e . , prostatitis , epididymitis ) due to E . coli , P . mirabilis , Klebsiella species , and some strains of enterococci .
Septicemia : Due to S . pneumoniae , S . aureus ( penicillin - sensitive and penicillin - resistant ) , P . mirabilis , E . coli , and Klebsiella species .
Endocarditis : Due to S . aureus ( penicillin - sensitive and penicillin - resistant ) and group A beta - hemolytic streptococci .
Perioperative Prophylaxis : The prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection , USP preoperatively , intraoperatively , and postoperatively may reduce the incidence of certain postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures which are classified as contaminated or potentially contaminated ( e . g . , vaginal hysterectomy , and cholecystectomy in high - risk patients such as those older than 70 years , with acute cholecystitis , obstructive jaundice , or common duct bile stones ) .
The perioperative use of Cefazolin for Injection , USP may also be effective in surgical patients in whom infection at the operative site would present a serious risk ( e . g . , during open - heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty ) .
The prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection , USP should usually be discontinued within a 24 hour period after the surgical procedure .
In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating ( e . g . , open - heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty ) , the prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection , USP may be continued for 3 to 5 days following the completion of surgery .
If there are signs of infection , specimens for cultures should be obtained for the identification of the causative organism so that appropriate therapy may be instituted .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection , USP and other antibacterial drugs , Cefazolin for Injection , USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : CEFAZOLIN FOR INJECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED IN PATIENTS WITH KNOWN ALLERGY TO THE CEPHALOSPORIN GROUP OF ANTIBIOTICS .
WARNINGS : BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFAZOLIN FOR INJECTION IS INSTITUTED , CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFAZOLIN , CEPHALOSPORINS , PENICILLINS , OR OTHER DRUGS .
IF THIS PRODUCT IS GIVEN TO PENICILLIN - SENSITIVE PATIENTS , CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS - HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG BETA - LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10 % OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY .
IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFAZOLIN FOR INJECTION OCCURS , DISCONTINUE TREATMENT WITH THE DRUG .
SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES , INCLUDING OXYGEN , IV FLUIDS , IV ANTIHISTAMINES , CORTICOSTEROIDS , PRESSOR AMINES , AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT , AS CLINICALLY INDICATED .
Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents , including cefazolin , and may range in severity from mild to life - threatening .
Therefore , it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia .
Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of “ antibiotic - associated colitis . ”
After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established , therapeutic measures should be initiated .
Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone .
In moderate to severe cases , consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes , protein supplementation , and treatment with an oral antibacterial drug clinically effective against C . difficile colitis .
PRECAUTIONS : General Prolonged use of Cefazolin for Injection may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms .
Careful clinical observation of the patient is essential .
When Cefazolin for Injection is administered to patients with low urinary output because of impaired renal function , lower daily dosage is required ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
As with other β - lactam antibiotics , seizures may occur if inappropriately high doses are administered to patients with impaired renal function ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Cefazolin for Injection , as with all cephalosporins , should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease , particularly colitis .
Cephalosporins may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity .
Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment or poor nutritional state , as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy , and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy .
Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated .
Prescribing Cefazolin for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
Drug Interactions Probenecid may decrease renal tubular secretion of cephalosporins when used concurrently , resulting in increased and more prolonged cephalosporin blood levels .
Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions A false positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with Benedict ' s solution , Fehling ' s solution or with CLINITEST ® tablets , but not with enzyme - based tests such as CLINISTIX ® .
Positive direct and indirect antiglobulin ( Coombs ) tests have occurred ; these may also occur in neonates whose mothers received cephalosporins before delivery .
Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Cefazolin for Injection , should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When Cefazolin for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may : ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment , and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Cefazolin for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
Carcinogenesis / Mutagenesis Mutagenicity studies and long - term studies in animals to determine the carcinogenic potential of Cefazolin for Injection have not been performed .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B . Reproduction studies have been performed in rats , mice , and rabbits at doses up to 25 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Cefazolin for Injection .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Labor and Delivery When cefazolin has been administered prior to caesarean section , drug levels in cord blood have been approximately one quarter to one third of maternal drug levels .
The drug appears to have no adverse effect on the fetus .
Nursing Mothers Cefazolin for Injection is present in very low concentrations in the milk of nursing mothers .
Caution should be exercised when Cefazolin for Injection is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness for use in premature infants and neonates have not been established .
See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for recommended dosage in pediatric patients older than 1 month .
Geriatric Use Of the 920 subjects who received Cefazolin for Injection in clinical studies , 313 ( 34 % ) were 65 years and over , while 138 ( 15 % ) were 75 years and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function ( see PRECAUTIONS , General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS : The following reactions have been reported : Gastrointestinal : Diarrhea , oral candidiasis ( oral thrush ) , vomiting , nausea , stomach cramps , anorexia and pseudomembranous colitis .
Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment ( see WARNINGS ) .
Nausea and vomiting have been reported rarely .
Allergic : Anaphylaxis , eosinophilia , itching , drug fever , skin rash , Stevens - Johnson syndrome .
Hematologic : Neutropenia , leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , thrombocythemia .
Hepatic : Transient rise in SGOT , SGPT , and alkaline phosphatase levels has been observed .
As with other cephalosporins , reports of hepatitis have been received .
Renal : As with other cephalosporins , reports of increased BUN and creatinine levels , as well as renal failure , have been received .
Local Reactions : Rare instances of phlebitis have been reported at site of injection .
Pain at the site of injection after intramuscular administration has occurred infrequently .
Some induration has occurred .
Other Reactions : Genital and anal pruritus ( including , vulvar pruritus , genital moniliasis , and vaginitis ) .

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : THE INTENT OF THE PHARMACY BULK PACKAGE FOR THIS PRODUCT IS FOR PREPARATION OF SOLUTIONS FOR I . V . INFUSION ONLY .
Usual Adult Dosage Type of Infection Dose Frequency Moderate to severe infections 500 mg to 1 gram every 6 to 8 hours Mild infections caused by susceptible gram - positive cocci 250 mg to 500 mg every 8 hours Acute , uncomplicated urinary tract infections 1 gram every 12 hours Pneumococcal pneumonia 500 mg every 12 hours Severe , life - threatening infections ( e . g . , endocarditis , septicemia ) * 1 gram to 1 . 5 grams every 6 hours * In rare instances , doses of up to 12 grams of cefazolin per day have been used .
Perioperative Prophylactic Use To prevent postoperative infection in contaminated or potentially contaminated surgery , recommended doses are : a ) 1 gram I . V . administered ½ hour to 1 hour prior to the start of surgery .
b ) For lengthy operative procedures ( e . g . , 2 hours or more ) , 500 mg to 1 gram I . V . during surgery ( administration modified depending on the duration of the operative procedure ) .
c ) 500 mg to 1 gram I . V . every 6 to 8 hours for 24 hours postoperatively .
It is important that ( 1 ) the preoperative dose be given just prior ( 1 / 2 hour to 1 hour ) to the start of surgery so that adequate antibiotic levels are present in the serum and tissues at the time of initial surgical incision ; and ( 2 ) Cefazolin for Injection be administered , if necessary , at appropriate intervals during surgery to provide sufficient levels of the antibiotic at the anticipated moments of greatest exposure to infective organisms .
In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating ( e . g . , open - heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty ) , the prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection may be continued for 3 to 5 days following the completion of surgery .
Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Reduced Renal Function Cefazolin for Injection may be used in patients with reduced renal function with the following dosage adjustments : Patients with a creatinine clearance of 55 mL / min .
or greater or a serum creatinine of 1 . 5 mg % or less can be given full doses .
Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 35 to 54 mL / min .
or serum creatinine of 1 . 6 to 3 . 0 mg % can also be given full doses but dosage should be restricted to at least 8 hour intervals .
Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 11 to 34 mL / min .
or serum creatinine of 3 . 1 to 4 . 5 mg % should be given ½ the usual dose every 12 hours .
Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 10 mL / min .
or less or serum creatinine of 4 . 6 mg % or greater should be given ½ the usual dose every 18 to 24 hours .
