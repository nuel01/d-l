Hypersensitivity to triphenylmethane or related compounds ( 4 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Life - threatening anaphylactic reactions have occurred after isosulfan blue 1 % administration .
Monitor patients closely for at least 60 minutes after administration of isosulfan blue 1 % ( 5 . 1 ) .
• The admixture of isosulfan blue 1 % with local anesthetics results in an immediate precipitation of 4 to 9 % drug complex .
Use a separate syringe for anesthetics ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Isosulfan blue 1 % interferes with measurements in peripheral blood pulse oximetry .
Arterial blood gas analysis may be needed ( 5 . 3 ) .
5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Life - threatening anaphylactic reactions ( respiratory distress , shock , angioedema ) have occurred after isosulfan blue 1 % administration .
Reactions are more likely to occur in patients with a history of bronchial asthma , allergies , drug reactions or previous reactions to triphenylmethane dyes .
Monitor patients closely for at least 60 minutes after administration of isosulfan blue 1 % .
Trained personnel should be available to administer emergency care including resuscitation .
5 . 2 Precipitation of Isosulfan Blue 1 % by Lidocaine The admixture of isosulfan blue 1 % ( with local anesthetics ( i . e . lidocaine ) ) in the same syringe results in an immediate precipitation of 4 to 9 % drug complex .
Use a separate syringe to administer a local anesthetic .
5 . 3 Interference with Oxygen Saturation and Methemoglobin Measurements Isosulfan blue 1 % interferes with measurements of oxygen saturation in peripheral blood by pulse oximetry and can cause falsely low readings .
The interference effect is maximal at 30 minutes and minimal generally by four hours after administration .
Arterial blood gas analysis may be needed to verify decreased arterial partial pressure of oxygen .
Isosulfan blue 1 % may also cause falsely elevated readings of methemoglobin by arterial blood gas analyzer .
Therefore , co - oximetry may be needed to verify methemoglobin level .
