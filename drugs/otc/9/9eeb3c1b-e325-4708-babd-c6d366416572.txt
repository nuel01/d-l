5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension : Abrupt discontinuation of GENOSYL may lead to worsening oxygenation and increasing pulmonary artery pressure ( 5 . 1 ) .
Methemoglobinemia : Methemoglobin increases with the dose of nitric oxide ; following discontinuation or reduction of nitric oxide , methemoglobin levels return to baseline over a period of hours ( 5 . 2 ) .
Elevated NO2 Levels : Monitor NO2 levels ( 5 . 3 ) .
Heart Failure : In patients with pre - existing left ventricular dysfunction , GENOSYL may increase pulmonary capillary wedge pressure leading to pulmonary edema ( 5 . 4 ) .
5 . 1 Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome following Abrupt Discontinuation Wean from GENOSYL [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Abrupt discontinuation of GENOSYL may lead to worsening oxygenation and increasing pulmonary artery pressure , i . e . , Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome .
Signs and symptoms of Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome include hypoxemia , systemic hypotension , bradycardia , and decreased cardiac output .
If Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension occurs , reinstate GENOSYL therapy immediately .
5 . 2 Hypoxemia from Methemoglobinemia Nitric oxide combines with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin , which does not transport oxygen .
Methemoglobin levels increase with the dose of GENOSYL ; it can take 8 hours or more before steady - state methemoglobin levels are attained .
Monitor methemoglobin and adjust the dose of GENOSYL to optimize oxygenation .
If methemoglobin levels do not resolve with decrease in dose or discontinuation of GENOSYL , additional therapy may be warranted to treat methemoglobinemia [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
5 . 3 Airway Injury from Nitrogen Dioxide Nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) forms in gas mixtures containing NO and O2 .
Nitrogen dioxide may cause airway inflammation and damage to lung tissues .
If there is an unexpected change in NO2 concentration , or if the NO2 concentration reaches 0 . 5 ppm when measured in the breathing circuit , then the delivery system should be assessed in accordance with the GENOSYL Delivery System Operator ' s Manual troubleshooting section , and the NO2 analyzer should be recalibrated .
The dose of GENOSYL and / or FiO2 should be adjusted as appropriate .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The adverse reaction information from the clinical studies does , however , provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates .
Controlled studies have included 325 patients on nitric oxide doses of 5 to 80 ppm and 251 patients on placebo .
Total mortality in the pooled trials was 11 % on placebo and 9 % on nitric oxide gas for inhalation , a result adequate to exclude nitric oxide mortality being more than 40 % worse than placebo .
In both the NINOS and CINRGI studies , the duration of hospitalization was similar in nitric oxide gas for inhalation and placebo - treated groups .
From all controlled studies , at least 6 months of follow - up is available for 278 patients who received nitric oxide gas and 212 patients who received placebo .
Among these patients , there was no evidence of an adverse effect of treatment on the need for re - hospitalization , special medical services , pulmonary disease , and neurological sequelae .
In the NINOS study , treatment groups were similar with respect to the incidence and severity of intracranial hemorrhage , Grade IV hemorrhage , periventricular leukomalacia , cerebral infarction , seizures requiring anticonvulsant therapy , pulmonary hemorrhage , or gastrointestinal hemorrhage .
In CINRGI , the only adverse reaction ( > 2 % higher incidence on nitric oxide gas for inhalation than on placebo ) was hypotension ( 14 % vs . 11 % ) .
6 . 2 Post - Marketing Experience Post marketing reports of accidental exposure to nitric oxide for inhalation in hospital staff have been associated with chest discomfort , dizziness , dry throat , dyspnea , and headache .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nitric oxide donor compounds may increase the risk of developing methemoglobinemia ( 7 ) .
7 . 1 Nitric Oxide Donor Agents Nitric oxide donor agents such as prilocaine , sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerine may increase the risk of developing methemoglobinemia .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of nitric oxide for inhalation has been demonstrated in term and near - term neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with evidence of pulmonary hypertension [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Additional studies conducted in premature neonates for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia have not demonstrated substantial evidence of efficacy [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
No information about its effectiveness in other age populations is available .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Nitric oxide is not indicated for use in the adult population .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with nitric oxide gas is manifest by elevations in methemoglobin and pulmonary toxicities associated with inspired NO2 .
Elevated NO2 may cause acute lung injury .
Elevations in methemoglobin reduce the oxygen delivery capacity of the circulation .
In clinical studies , NO2 levels > 3 ppm or methemoglobin levels > 7 % were treated by reducing the dose of , or discontinuing , nitric oxide gas .
Methemoglobinemia that does not resolve after reduction or discontinuation of therapy can be treated with intravenous vitamin C , intravenous methylene blue , or blood transfusion , based upon the clinical situation .
11 DESCRIPTION GENOSYL ( nitric oxide ) is administered by inhalation .
Nitric oxide is a pulmonary vasodilator .
Nitric oxide is generated from liquid dinitrogen tetroxide ( N2O4 ) by the cassette in the GENOSYL Delivery System .
Upon initiation of GENOSYL Delivery System , the liquid N2O4 is heated and the equilibrium shifts to nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) gas .
The NO2 is then converted into nitric oxide ( NO ) using the antioxidant cartridges , and nitric oxide is delivered to the patient by means of a ventilator or a nasal cannula .
The amount of nitric oxide administered to the patient is set by controlling the temperature of the N2O4 liquid module , which controls the pressure inside the liquid module , which in turn controls the mass of NO2 that is sent to the primary cartridges , and hence the mass of nitric oxide .
The mass flow of nitric oxide , together with the air from the pump , control the nitric oxide concentration .
A nitric oxide sensor monitors the nitric oxide in the patient line .
GENOSYL Delivery System is designed to deliver a controlled level of nitric oxide blended with breathing air or oxygen - enriched breathing air .
The GENOSYL Delivery System controls the flow of nitric oxide mixed with air delivered to the patient .
The structural formula of nitric oxide ( NO ) is shown below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Nitric oxide relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase , activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine 3 ' , 5 ' - monophosphate , which then leads to vasodilation .
When inhaled , nitric oxide selectively dilates the pulmonary vasculature , and because of efficient scavenging by hemoglobin , has minimal effect on the systemic vasculature .
GENOSYL appears to increase the partial pressure of arterial oxygen ( PaO2 ) by dilating pulmonary vessels in better ventilated areas of the lung , redistributing pulmonary blood flow away from lung regions with low ventilation / perfusion ( V / Q ) ratios toward regions with normal ratios .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on Pulmonary Vascular Tone in PPHN Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn ( PPHN ) occurs as a primary developmental defect or as a condition secondary to other diseases such as meconium aspiration syndrome ( MAS ) , pneumonia , sepsis , hyaline membrane disease , congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( CDH ) , and pulmonary hypoplasia .
In these states , pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) is high , which results in hypoxemia secondary to right - to - left shunting of blood through the patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale .
In neonates with PPHN , nitric oxide gas for inhalation improves oxygenation ( as indicated by significant increases in PaO2 ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of nitric oxide has been studied in adults .
Absorption and Distribution Nitric oxide is absorbed systemically after inhalation .
Most of it traverses the pulmonary capillary bed where it combines with hemoglobin that is 60 % to 100 % oxygen - saturated .
At this level of oxygen saturation , nitric oxide combines predominantly with oxyhemoglobin to produce methemoglobin and nitrate .
At low oxygen saturation , nitric oxide can combine with deoxyhemoglobin to transiently form nitrosylhemoglobin , which is converted to nitrogen oxides and methemoglobin upon exposure to oxygen .
Within the pulmonary system , nitric oxide can combine with oxygen and water to produce nitrogen dioxide and nitrite , respectively , which interact with oxyhemoglobin to produce methemoglobin and nitrate .
Thus , the end products of nitric oxide that enter the systemic circulation are predominantly methemoglobin and nitrate .
Metabolism Methemoglobin disposition has been investigated as a function of time and nitric oxide exposure concentration in neonates with respiratory failure .
The methemoglobin ( MetHb ) concentration - time profiles during the first 12 hours of exposure to 0 , 5 , 20 , and 80 ppm nitric oxide are shown in Figure 1 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Methemoglobin concentrations increased during the first 8 hours of nitric oxide exposure .
The mean methemoglobin level remained below 1 % in the placebo group and in the 5 ppm and 20 ppm nitric oxide gas groups , but reached approximately 5 % in the 80 ppm nitric oxide gas group .
Methemoglobin levels > 7 % were attained only in patients receiving 80 ppm , where they comprised 35 % of the group .
The average time to reach peak methemoglobin was 10 Â± 9 ( SD ) hours ( median , 8 hours ) in these 13 patients , but one patient did not exceed 7 % until 40 hours .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Elimination Nitrate has been identified as the predominant nitric oxide metabolite excreted in the urine , accounting for > 70 % of the nitric oxide dose inhaled .
Nitrate is cleared from the plasma by the kidney at rates approaching the rate of glomerular filtration .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was apparent , at inhalation exposures up to the recommended dose ( 20 ppm ) , in rats for 20 hr / day for up to two years .
Higher exposures have not been investigated .
Nitric oxide gas has demonstrated genotoxicity in Salmonella ( Ames Test ) , human lymphocytes , and after in vivo exposure in rats .
There are no animal or human studies to evaluate nitric oxide for effects on fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Treatment of Hypoxic Respiratory Failure ( HRF ) The efficacy of nitric oxide gas was investigated in term and near - term newborns with hypoxic respiratory failure ( HRF ) resulting from a variety of etiologies .
Inhalation of nitric oxide gas reduces the oxygenation index ( OI = mean airway pressure in cm H2O Ã fraction of inspired oxygen concentration [ FiO2 ] Ã 100 divided by systemic arterial concentration in mm Hg [ PaO2 ] ) and increases PaO2 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
NINOS Study The Neonatal Inhaled Nitric Oxide Study ( NINOS ) was a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , multicenter trial in 235 neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure .
The objective of the study was to determine whether inhaled nitric oxide would reduce the occurrence of death and / or initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) in a prospectively defined cohort of term or near - term neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure unresponsive to conventional therapy .
Hypoxic respiratory failure was caused by meconium aspiration syndrome ( MAS ; 49 % ) , pneumonia / sepsis ( 21 % ) , idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension of the newborn ( PPHN ; 17 % ) , or respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ; 11 % ) .
Infants â¤ 14 days of age ( mean , 1 . 7 days ) with a mean PaO2 of 46 mmHg and a mean oxygenation index ( OI ) of 43 cm H2O / mmHg were initially randomized to receive 100 % O2 with ( n = 114 ) or without ( n = 121 ) 20 ppm nitric oxide for up to 14 days .
Response to study drug was defined as a change from baseline in PaO2 30 minutes after starting treatment ( full response = > 20 mmHg , partial = 10 - 20 mmHg , no response = < 10 mmHg ) .
Neonates with a less than full response were evaluated for a response to 80 ppm nitric oxide or control gas .
The primary results of this study are presented in Table 1 .
Table 1 : Summary of Clinical Results from Hypoxic Respiratory Failure Study Control ( n = 121 ) Nitric Oxide gas ( n = 114 ) P value Death or ECMO [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 77 ( 64 % ) 52 ( 46 % ) 0 . 006 Death 20 ( 17 % ) 16 ( 14 % ) 0 . 60 ECMO 66 ( 55 % ) 44 ( 39 % ) 0 . 014 [ 1 ] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ 2 ] Death or need for ECMO was the parimary end point of this study Although the incidence of death by 120 days of age was similar in both groups ( NO , 14 % ; control 17 % ) , significantly fewer infants in the nitric oxide group required ECMO compared with controls ( 39 % vs . 55 % , p = 0 . 014 ) .
The combined incidence of death and / or initiation of ECMO showed a significant advantage for the nitric oxide treated group ( 46 % vs . 64 % , p = 0 . 006 ) .
The nitric oxide group also had significantly greater increases in PaO2 and greater decreases in the OI and the alveolar - arterial oxygen gradient than the control group ( p < 0 . 001 for all parameters ) .
Significantly more patients had at least a partial response to the initial administration of study drug in the nitric oxide group ( 66 % ) than the control group ( 26 % , p < 0 . 001 ) .
Of the 125 infants who did not respond to 20 ppm nitric oxide control , similar percentages of NO - treated ( 18 % ) and control ( 20 % ) patients had at least a partial response to 80 ppm nitric oxide gas for inhalation or control drug , suggesting a lack of additional benefit for the higher dose of nitric oxide .
No infant had study drug discontinued for toxicity .
Inhaled nitric oxide gas had no detectable effect on mortality .
The adverse events collected in the NINOS trial occurred at similar incidence rates in both treatment groups [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Follow - up exams were performed at 18 - 24 months for the infants enrolled in this trial .
In the infants with available follow - up , the two treatment groups were similar with respect to their mental , motor , audiologic , or neurologic evaluations .
CINRGI Study This study was a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , multi - center trial of 186 term and near - term neonates with pulmonary hypertension and hypoxic respiratory failure .
The primary objective of the study was to determine whether nitric oxide gas would reduce the receipt of ECMO in these patients .
Hypoxic respiratory failure was caused by MAS ( 35 % ) , idiopathic PPHN ( 30 % ) , pneumonia / sepsis ( 24 % ) , or RDS ( 8 % ) .
Patients with a mean PaO2 of 54 mmHg and a mean OI of 44 cm H2O / mmHg were randomly assigned to receive either 20 ppm nitric oxide gas ( n = 97 ) or nitrogen gas ( placebo ; n = 89 ) in addition to their ventilatory support .
Patients who exhibited a PaO2 > 60 mmHg and a pH < 7 . 55 were weaned to 5 ppm nitric oxide gas or placebo .
The primary results from the CINRGI study are presented in Table 2 .
Table 2 : Summary of Clinical Results from Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn Study Placebo Nitric oxide gas P value ECMO [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 51 / 89 ( 57 % ) 30 / 97 ( 31 % ) < 0 . 001 Death 5 / 89 ( 6 % ) 3 / 97 ( 3 % ) 0 . 48 [ 1 ] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ 2 ] ECMO was the primary end point of this study Significantly fewer neonates in the nitric oxide gas group required ECMO compared to the control group ( 31 % vs . 57 % , p < 0 . 001 ) .
While the number of deaths were similar in both groups ( Nitric oxide gas , 3 % ; placebo , 6 % ) , the combined incidence of death and / or receipt of ECMO was decreased in the nitric oxide gas group ( 33 % vs . 58 % , p < 0 . 001 ) .
In addition , the nitric oxide gas group had significantly improved oxygenation as measured by PaO2 , OI , and alveolar - arterial gradient ( p < 0 . 001 for all parameters ) .
Of the 97 patients treated with nitric oxide gas , 2 ( 2 % ) were withdrawn from study drug due to methemoglobin levels > 4 % .
The frequency and number of adverse events reported were similar in the two study groups [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In clinical trials , reduction in the need for ECMO has not been demonstrated with the use of inhaled nitric oxide in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( CDH ) .
14 . 2 Ineffective in Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) In a randomized , double - blind , parallel , multicenter study , 385 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) associated with pneumonia ( 46 % ) , surgery ( 33 % ) , multiple trauma ( 26 % ) , aspiration ( 23 % ) , pulmonary contusion ( 18 % ) , and other causes , with PaO2 / FiO2 < 250 mmHg despite optimal oxygenation and ventilation , received placebo ( n = 193 ) or nitric oxide gas ( n = 192 ) , 5 ppm , for 4 hours to 28 days or until weaned because of improvements in oxygenation .
Despite acute improvements in oxygenation , there was no effect of nitric oxide gas on the primary endpoint of days alive and off ventilator support .
These results were consistent with outcome data from a smaller dose ranging study of nitric oxide ( 1 . 25 to 80 ppm ) .
GENOSYL ( nitric oxide ) for inhalation is not indicated for use in ARDS .
14 . 3 Ineffective in Prevention of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ( BPD ) The safety and efficacy of nitric oxide gas for the prevention of chronic lung disease [ bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) ] in neonates â¤ 34 weeks gestational age requiring respiratory support has been studied in four large previously conducted multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials in a total of 2 , 600 preterm infants .
Of these , 1 , 290 received placebo , and 1 , 310 received inhaled nitric oxide at doses ranging from 5 - 20 ppm , for treatment periods of 7 - 24 days duration .
The primary endpoint for these studies was alive and without BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age ( PMA ) .
The need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA served as a surrogate endpoint for the presence of BPD .
Overall , efficacy for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants was not established .
There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups with regard to overall deaths , methemoglobin levels , or adverse events commonly observed in premature infants , including intraventricular hemorrhage , patent ductus arteriosus , pulmonary hemorrhage , and retinopathy of prematurity .
The use of GENOSYL ( nitric oxide ) for prevention of BPD in preterm neonates â¤ 34 weeks gestational age is not recommended .

1 . 2 General Information and Indications for Use GENOSYL DS generates and delivers NO for inhalation at the point of use .
The concentration of NO , as set by the user , is monitored , and adjusted to accurately dose the patient throughout an inspired breath .
Only validated devices / components should be used with the GENOSYL DS .
The intended population for inhaled NO treatment is term and near - term neonates in neonatal intensive care units ( NICUs ) .
Refer to the GENOSYL ( nitric oxide ) for inhalation drug label for more detailed information .
The GENOSYL DS is intended for use in the hospital and 1 . 5 Tesla and 3 . 0 Tesla diagnostic imaging environments .
The GENOSYL DS is intended for use by healthcare professionals ( HCPs ) who are licensed and actively practicing pediatric and / or neonatal respiratory therapists ( RTs ) in the United States .
These users are required to set up , administer inhaled Nitric Oxide and provide respiratory care ( including initiation and maintenance of mechanical ventilators ) in the critically ill neonatal population .
The GENOSYL DS starts with liquid N2O4 / NO2 , which is then converted in a proprietary Cassette to NO .
The GENOSYL DS delivers NO into the ventilator stream , where the NO joins a stream of air or O2 and is diluted to the prescribed concentration .
The NO concentration ( dose ) to be delivered to the patient is selected by the user and is set and maintained independently by means of computer - controlled air pumps , Cassette heaters , and a feedback loop that measures the delivered NO concentration .
The GENOSYL DS takes a gas sample removed from the NO gas flow stream immediately prior to the patient and provides real - time output of the NO , NO2 , and O2 concentrations that are being delivered to the patient .
The continuous integrated gas monitoring includes a comprehensive alarm system .
The NO concentration detected from the sample line is used in a feedback loop to adjust the NO concentration delivered into the ventilator circuit .
The GENOSYL DS includes a redundant Console for complete Back - up capability for delivery of NO for inhalation .
Each Console has a back - up battery that provides at least 1 hour of NO delivery in the absence of an external power source .
1 . 3 Principles of Operation GENOSYL DS .
The GENOSYL DS continuously introduces a precisely controlled concentration of Nitric Oxide ( NO ) into the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit .
GENOSYL DS utilizes the known properties of NO and other oxides of nitrogen , namely dinitrogen tetroxide ( N2O4 ) and nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , to create a " tankless " drug / device combination System to produce , at the point of use , ultra - high purity NO for inhalation , providing a consistent , prescribed dose to the patient .
Console .
The GENOSYL DS Console contains the electronics to control the production and to maintain the constant and precise delivery of NO .
The primary features of the Console front panel are displayed in Figure 1 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] NO generation .
The Console uses Cassettes containing liquid N2O4 / NO2 inside a stainless - steel vessel ( the liquid module ) and an antioxidant cartridge .
Upon initiation of a Cassette , the liquid N2O4 is heated , producing NO2 gas , which is mixed with up to 0 . 9 LPM ambient air supplied by the Console .
The NO2 / air is injected into the antioxidant cartridge inside the Cassette , which converts NO2 to NO .
The Cassette is designed to provide NO in concentrations up to 80 ppm .
The maximum and minimum delivered dose for a range of constant inspiratory flow rates is presented in Figure 2 .
The maximum combination of dose ( ppm ) and flow ( LPM ) output of the System is 800 ppm Ã LPM ( e . g . , 20 ppm with 40 LPM , 40 ppm at 20 LPM , etc . ) .
The System is capable of delivering NO at a minimum of 1 ppm Ã LPM ( e . g . , 1 ppm at 1 LPM ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] The total time to deplete the Cassette N2O4 contents depends on the rate of use .
The minimum time to depletion based on use rate is shown in Figure 3 .
The calculated minimum remaining contents at the current output rate is indicated by a gauge presented on the Console display during use .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] NO Injection into the Ventilator Circuit .
After NO is produced in the Cassette , the NO injector introduces the concentrated NO into the ventilator circuit where the NO is diluted to the prescribed concentration ( dose ) and mixed with the O2 or air supplied to the patient .
Before the gas mixture reaches the patient , a sample line removes a small gas sample and sends it back to the Console , where gas sensors continuously measure the supplied NO , NO2 and O2 .
The Console software then compares the measured NO concentration to the set NO concentration and continuously adjusts the delivery of NO to maintain the prescribed NO concentration ( dose ) delivered to the patient ( closed loop control ) .
The Console software commands the NO injection flow rate into the ventilator circuit with a maximum flow rate of 0 . 9 LPM .
Changes in the ventilator settings by the user may cause brief transient changes in the measured NO value .
The Console software will adjust the injected flow rate and the internal temperature of the Cassette to compensate for the changes in the total ventilator flow rate .
For example , a higher minute ventilation will require a higher injection flow rate to produce the same NO concentration .
Mixer .
An inline Mixer is used in the applicable ventilator circuit after the NO injection site and before the gas sample site to mix NO from the Console with the gas supplied by the ventilator , for specific ventilator and tidal volume use cases per Section 10 . 2 .
Gas Monitoring .
The gas mixture delivered to the patient by the GENOSYL DS is continuously monitored with two NO detectors , with one providing redundant back - up , as well as a detector for NO2 and O2 .
A sample of inspired gas is taken from the inspiratory limb , close to the patient , and is measured by the gas sensor within the Console .
The gas monitoring sensors are electrochemical ; they are specific to each gas and provide an electronic signal that is proportional to the concentration of gas present .
Adaptive Sensor .
The Adaptive Sensor is used to detect flow in the patient breathing circuit .
When flow is not detected by the Adaptive Sensor , Nitric Oxide delivery will be interrupted until flow is detected .
The Console will provide a visual and audible high priority alarm when flow is not detected to alert the user ( see Section 8 . 2 ) .
Once flow is detected , the Console will auto resume delivery of nitric oxide at the previously set dose .
An Adaptive Sensor is recommended for use with certain breathing devices .
Refer to Section 3 for recommended set up diagrams .
The GENOSYL DS will properly deliver and control Nitric Oxide dose in the absence of an Adaptive Sensor .
Alarms and Dosing Safeguard Fallback Modes .
The GENOSYL DS alerts the user in the event of excursions of NO , NO2 , and Oxygen from their expected ranges .
Nitric Oxide delivery interruption conditions are as follows : â¢ a ) NO > 100 ppm â¢ b ) NO2 reaches 3 ppm â¢ c ) The measured respiratory circuit dilution flow drops below 0 . 3 SLPM as measured by the Adaptive Sensor .
The Console will provide a visual and audible high priority alarm .
When detecting a sustained gas level higher than the above limits for 11 consecutive seconds , the Console will interrupt delivery of NO until the sampled levels of NO and / or NO2 decrease to a safe level .
Once sampled levels are in acceptable range , the Console will resume delivery with previously set dose .
If the cause of the high gas cannot be resolved , the use of the Back - up Console may be required .
Refer to Section 8 . 1 for additional information on alarms and dosing safeguards .
If NO delivery was interrupted due to the GENOSYL DS Adaptive Sensor reading dropping below 0 . 3 SLPM , the Console will resume delivery with the previously set dose once the Adaptive Sensor reading exceeds 0 . 35 SLPM .
The automatic resumption of dose delivery after the interruption conditions listed above are cleared is one of the safety fallback modes of the GENOSYL DS .
Back - up NO Delivery .
The Back - up Console is used to administer Nitric Oxide when the Dosing Console cannot be used .
This Console has a separate power supply , and at least one Cassette loaded and preheated .
If the Dosing Console fails to deliver NO , the Back - up Console is ready to begin dosing to continue NO delivery .
Transition to a new Cassette .
When a Cassette approaches depletion , the Dosing Console will automatically transition to the second Cassette in the Console .
Once the dosing Cassette is depleted , the Dosing Console will eject the depleted Cassette and alert the user to replace via the Cassette Status Indicator .
Disposal of the Cassette .
Following use , any remaining Cassette contents are purged into an inerting chamber , where the contents are chemically neutralized , rendering the Cassette safe for disposal .
1 . 4 Exposure of Healthcare Providers to NO and NO2 Occupational exposure of healthcare providers to NO or NO2 may occur during Inhaled NO therapy for patients .
Below are examples of calculated and observed exposure to NO or NO2 , in the context of guideline workplace exposure limits .
Calculated and observational methods show that the exposure levels to NO or NO2 from an NO delivery System are significantly less than the levels recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) .
Workplace Limits : NIOSH has recommended workplace exposure limits as follows [ 1 ] .
NO time - weighted ( 8 hours ) average concentration limit of 25 ppm NO2 Recommended exposure limit of 1 ppm Theoretical Calculation .
The build - up of NO in a well - ventilated ICU room , with NO flowing directly into the room , can be evaluated using the following calculation : Room size 1000 ft3 Room volume 28 , 300 L Room ventilation ( 6 complete exchanges / hour ) 2 , 830 L / min NO flow into the room 80 ppm at 14 L / min Average NO room concentration ( 80 Ã 14 ) Ã· 2 , 830 = 0 . 396 ppm ( 0 . 4 ppm ) 0 . 4 ppm of NO Observations of NO Exposure .
The theoretical calculation has been supplemented by actual measurements in three independent studies in actual therapeutic use settings .
[ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] The studies found that detectable exposures to NO and NO2 were brief , infrequent , and well below recommended exposure limits .
If the location for using NO has uncertain ventilation , then the location should be evaluated for NO and NO2 build - up prior to use .

GENOSYL Â® DS [ MULTIMEDIA ] SECTION 9 SYSTEM MAINTENANCE 9 .
SYSTEM MAINTENANCE 9 . 1 Calibration This section describes the process for performing high and low calibration for NO , NO2 , and O2 .
Calibration of the GENOSYL DS should be performed every 14 days to ensure the accuracy of NO , NO2 , and O2 measurements .
All calibrations can be performed at any time the Console is powered on , including while actively dosing .
Air calibrates the low range for the NO and NO2 sensors .
The high range of the NO and NO2 sensors are calibrated by using calibration gas tanks .
The software will notify the user when calibration is due .
The display within the calibration tab provides the status and the calibration due date of the different types of sensors .
Air calibration provides the time of the last calibration since the System automatically performs this calibration every 4 hours while actively dosing or every 24 hours while powered on .
A green check under status indicates that sensor has successfully been executed within the calibration period .
A red X under status indicates that the sensor has not successfully been executed within the calibration period .
During calibration , the display will provide measured readings from each sensor .
Note , there are two redundant NO sensors which are used to verify and ensure accuracy of the dosage provided by the System .
During calibration , the display will provide a real - time status of the test with colored boxes to the right of the displayed sensor output .
A yellow box indicates that the sensor is being calibrated .
A green box indicates that calibration was successful for that sensor .
A red box indicates that calibration for that sensor failed .
WARNING â¢ ONLY use the calibration gas pressure regulators supplied by the manufacturer .
Pressure regulators not supplied by the manufacturer may damage the sensors and may lead to patient injury .
â¢ ALWAYS verify the correct NIST traceable calibration gas is being used and confirm the expiration date of the calibration gas prior to performing calibration .
The use of incorrect or expired gas may result in inaccurate sensor readings and can lead to patient injury .
â¢ NEVER perform NO or NO2 calibration within the MR scanner room .
Calibration equipment is a potential projectile hazard .
CAUTION â¢ ALWAYS perform a full - scale calibration of the GENOSYL DS when prompted by the System prior to use .
â¢ ALWAYS confirm the correct flow direction of the installed one - way check valve in the sampling tee to avoid over pressurization of the sample system and damage to the device .

GENOSYL Â® DS [ MULTIMEDIA ] SECTION 10 MECHANICAL VENTILATION 10 .
MECHANICAL VENTILATION WARNING â¢ ONLY mechanical ventilators validated with the GENOSYL DS should be used .
Not using a validated ventilator system can result in injury or harm .
â¢ DO NOT use the GENOSYL DS with circle anesthesia ventilator systems .
The GENOSYL DS has not been characterized or qualified for use with anesthesia breathing systems with recirculation of gases .
10 . 1 Mechanical Ventilation There are two main effects of connecting the GENOSYL DS to a ventilator breathing circuit : â¢ The System injects up to 0 . 9 LPM of NO / air ( 21 % Oxygen ) into the inspiratory output of the ventilator .
â¢ The System samples up to 0 . 3 LPM from the ventilator circuit as a measurement to the built - in gas analyzers The results of adding and subtracting gas into the ventilator circuit are described in sections 10 . 1 . 1 to 10 . 1 . 4 : 10 . 1 . 1 Oxygen Dilution The ventilator typically is flowing gas to the patient with enhanced oxygen content from room air at 21 % to pure oxygen at 100 % .
The DS is injecting the NO in air with a concentration of oxygen at nominally 21 % .
Thus , except for the case where the ventilator is supplying gas to the patient at 21 % oxygen , there is some dilution of the oxygen to the patient .
This dilution is given by the following equation : Percent O2 to Patient = [ { % O2 / 100 + ( Flowinj / Flowvent ) Ã 0 . 21 } / { 1 + ( Flowinj / Flowvent ) } ] Ã 100 Where : â¢ Flowinj = Injection flow in same units as ventilator flow â¢ Flowvent = Ventilator flow in same units as injection flow â¢ % O2 = Percent oxygen out of ventilator â¢ 0 . 21 = Fraction of oxygen in injection flow ( 21 % ) The table below shows the effect on the actual concentration of oxygen supplied to the patient for set ventilator flow settings with a nominal flow of 0 . 6 LPM of NO / air ( 21 % Oxygen ) into the inspiratory output of the ventilator .

Some minor ventilator adjustments to the minute volume may be required .
Maximum total flow added to the ventilator circuit is 0 . 9 LPM of concentrated NO gas and the maximum total flow removed from the ventilator circuit is 0 . 3 LPM of sampled gas .
10 . 1 . 3 Trigger Sensitivity The addition and subtraction of gases by the GENOSYL DS may affect the trigger sensitivity of the ventilator when using synchronized modes of ventilation .
This may cause the ventilator to auto - trigger in ventilators which have flow trigger modes , especially where the trigger flow is less than the total flow added to the System .
10 . 1 . 4 Maximum NO Delivery The maximum combination of dose ( ppm ) and flow ( LPM ) is 800 .
ppm x LPM ( e . g . , 20 ppm with 40 LPM , 40 ppm at 20 LPM , etc . ) .
The System is capable of delivering NO at a minimum of 1 ppm x LPM ( e . g . , 1 ppm at 1 LPM ) .
See the graph below for the minimum and maximum dose ranges for the System , based on ventilator circuit total minute volume .

Testing was conducted using standard American College of Radiology ( ACR ) sequences and a standard ACR large phantom placed inside a transmit - receive head coil .
Duplicate sequences were performed to acquire the same images with and without the GENOSYL DS Nitric Oxide Delivery System operating on battery power inside the MRI suite .
The GENOSYL DS compatibility test results are as follows : Artifact Dimensional Analysis 1 . 5 T The maximum dimensional change in images acquired during the operation of the GENOSYL DS was < 1 mm .
3 T The maximum dimensional change in images acquired during the operation of the GENOSYL DS was < 1 mm .
Image Quality Signal - to - Noise Ratio Analysis 1 . 5 T The average SNR change was - 35 % .
The average SFNR change was - 42 % .
The PIU values were all 96 % .
3 T The average SNR change was - 25 % .
The average SFNR change was - 22 % .
The PIU values were all greater than 94 % .
The GENOSYL DS does not distort the geometric accuracy and the image intensity uniformity is not adversely affected by the presence of the GENOSYL DS at the 100 Gauss line .
The SNR and SFNR are both impacted by the presence of the GENOSYL DS , to a more pronounced degree when the equipment is powered via a wall outlet inside the MRI suite versus operating on the battery .
NOTE â¢ The test results presented here were obtained with the GENOSYL DS operating on battery power .
â¢ If using the GENOSYL DS while connected to wall power , it is recommended to route the power cords through a waveguide .

Conducted RF IEC 61000 - 4 - 6 6 V rms 150 kHz to 80 MHz in ISM bands [ 1 ] 10 V 80 % AM @ 1 kHz 150 kHz - 80 MHz in ISM bands , Except as indicated on page 10 - 137 , portable and mobile RF communications equipment , including cables , should be used no closer to any part of the GENOSYL DS than the recommended separation distance calculated from the equation applicable to the frequency of the transmitter .
Recommended separation distance : d = 1 . 2 â P d = 1 . 2 â P d = 1 . 2 â P 80 MHz to 800 MHz d = 2 . 3 â P 800 MHz to 2 . 7 GHz where P is the maximum output power rating of the transmitter in watts ( W ) according to the transmitter manufacturer and d is the recommended separation distance in meters ( m ) .
[ 2 ] Radiated RF IEC 61000 - 4 - 3 10 V / m 80 MHz to 2 . 7 GHz 10 V / m 80 MHz to 2 . 7 GHz Field strengths from fixed RF transmitters , as determined by an electromagnetic site survey , [ 3 ] should be less than the compliance level in each frequency range .
[ 4 ] Interference may occur in the vicinity of equipment marked with the following symbol : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ 1 ] The ISM ( industrial , scientific and medical ) bands between 150 kHz and 80 MHz are 6 . 765 MHz to 6 . 795 MHz ; 13 . 553 MHz to 13 . 567 MHz ; 26 . 957 MHz to 27 . 283 MHz ; and 40 . 66 MHz to 40 . 70 MHz .
[ 2 ] The compliance levels in the ISM frequency bands between 150 kHz and 80 MHz and in the frequency range 80 MHz to 2 . 7 GHz are intended to decrease the likelihood that a portable communications device could cause interference if it is inadvertently brought into patient areas .
For this reason , an additional factor of 10 / 3 is used in calculating the recommended separation distance for transmitters in these frequency ranges .
[ 3 ] Field strengths from fixed transmitters , such as base stations for radio ( cellular cordless ) telephones and land mobile radios , amateur radio , AM and F M radio broadcast and TV broadcast cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy .
To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed R transmitters , an electromagnetic site survey should be considered .
If the measured field strength in the location in which the GENOSYL DS is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above , the GENOSYL DS should be observed to verify normal operation .
If abnormal performance is observed , additional measures may be necessary , such as reorienting or relocating the GENOSYL DS .
[ 4 ] Over the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz , field strengths should be less than 3 V / m .
NOTE NOTE 1 : At 80 MHz and 800 MHz , the higher frequency range applies .
NOTE 2 : These guidelines may not apply in all situations .
Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection from structures , objects and people .
Recommended separation distances between portable and mobile RF communications equipment and the GENOSYL DS The GENOSYL DS is intended for use in an electromagnetic environment in which radiated RF disturbances are controlled .
The customer or the user of the GENOSYL DS can help prevent electromagnetic interference by maintaining a minimum distance between portable and mobile RF communications equipment ( transmitters ) and the GENOSYL DS as recommended below , according to the maximum output power of the communications equipment except as indicated on page 10 - 166 .
