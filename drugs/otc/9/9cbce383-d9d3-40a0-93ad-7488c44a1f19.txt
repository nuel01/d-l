[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) 4 / 2022 WARNING : CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives ( COC ) use .
This risk increases with age , particularly in women over 35 years of age , and with the number of cigarettes smoked .
For this reason , COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ] .
WARNING : CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning .
• Women over 35 years old who smoke should not use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol ) .
( 4 ) • Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive ( COC ) use .
( 4 ) 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Syeda ® ( drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets ) is indicated for use by women to prevent pregnancy .
Syeda ® ( drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets ) is an estrogen / progestin COC indicated for use by women to prevent pregnancy .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Take one tablet daily by mouth at the same time every day .
( 2 . 1 ) Tablets must be taken in the order directed on the blister pack .
( 2 . 1 ) 2 . 1 How to Take Syeda Take one tablet by mouth at the same time every day .
The failure rate may increase when pills are missed or taken incorrectly .
To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness , Syeda must be taken as directed , in the order directed on the blister pack .
Single missed pills should be taken as soon as remembered .
2 . 2 How to Start Syeda Instruct the patient to begin taking Syeda either on the first day of her menstrual period ( Day 1 Start ) or on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period ( Sunday Start ) .
Day 1 Start During the first cycle of Syeda use , instruct the patient to take one yellow Syeda daily , beginning on Day 1 of her menstrual cycle .
( The first day of menstruation is Day 1 . )
She should take one yellow Syeda daily for 21 consecutive days , followed by one white tablet daily on Days 22 through 28 .
Syeda should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day , preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid , as needed .
Syeda can be taken without regard to meals .
If Syeda is first taken later than the first day of the menstrual cycle , Syeda should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration .
Instruct the patient to use a non - hormonal contraceptive as back - up during the first 7 days .
The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered .
Sunday Start During the first cycle of Syeda use , instruct the patient to take one yellow Syeda daily , beginning on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period .
She should take one yellow Syedadaily for 21 consecutive days , followed by one white tablet daily on Days 22 through 28 .
Syeda should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day , preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid , as needed .
Syeda can be taken without regard to meals .
Syeda should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration .
Instruct the patient to use a non - hormonal contraceptive as back - up during the first 7 days .
The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered .
The patient should begin her next and all subsequent 28 - day regimens of Syeda on the same day of the week that she began her first regimen , following the same schedule .
She should begin taking her yellow tablets on the next day after ingestion of the last white tablet , regardless of whether or not a menstrual period has occurred or is still in progress .
Anytime a subsequent cycle of Syeda is started later than the day following administration of the last white tablet , the patient should use another method of contraception until she has taken a yellow Syeda daily for seven consecutive days .
When switching from a different birth control pill When switching from another birth control pill , Syeda should be started on the same day that a new pack of the previous oral contraceptive would have been started .
When switching from a method other than a birth control pill When switching from a transdermal patch or vaginal ring , Syeda should be started when the next application would have been due .
When switching from an injection , Syeda should be started when the next dose would have been due .
When switching from an intrauterine contraceptive or an implant , Syedashould be started on the day of removal .
Withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within 3 days following the last yellow tablet .
If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs while taking Syeda , instruct the patient to continue taking Syeda by the regimen described above .
Counsel her that this type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance ; however , advise her that if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged , she should consult her healthcare provider .
Although the occurrence of pregnancy is low if Syeda is taken according to directions , if withdrawal bleeding does not occur , consider the possibility of pregnancy .
If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule ( missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have ) , consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures .
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods , rule out pregnancy .
Discontinue Syeda if pregnancy is confirmed .
The risk of pregnancy increases with each active yellow tablet missed .
For additional patient instructions regarding missed pills , see the “ WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS ” section in the FDA - Approved Patient Labeling .
If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed tablets , it will usually be transient and of no consequence .
If the patient misses one or more white tablets , she should still be protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking a new cycle of yellow tablets on the proper day .
For postpartum women who do not breastfeed or after a second trimester abortion , start Syeda no earlier than 4 weeks postpartum due to the increased risk of thromboembolism .
If the patient starts Syeda postpartum and has not yet had a period , evaluate for possible pregnancy , and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken Syeda for 7 consecutive days .
2 . 3 Advice in Case of Gastrointestinal Disturbances In case of severe vomiting or diarrhea , absorption may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken .
If vomiting occurs within 3 to 4 hours after tablet - taking , this can be regarded as a missed tablet .

Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery .
Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery , in women who are not breastfeeding .
( 5 . 1 ) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins .
Before initiating drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP , consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP - containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE .
( 5 . 1 ) • Hyperkalemia : DRSP has anti - mineralocorticoid activity not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia .
Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long - term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration .
( 5 . 2 , 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 ) • Liver disease : Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if jaundice occurs .
( 5 . 4 ) • High blood pressure : Do not prescribe drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease .
( 5 . 5 ) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects : Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol .
Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia .
( 5 . 7 ) • Headache : Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if indicated .
( 5 . 8 ) • Uterine bleeding : Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea .
( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if an arterial or venous thrombotic ( VTE ) event occurs .
Based on presently available information on drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol , DRSP - containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins .
Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three - fold increase .
Before initiating use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP , consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP - containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE .
Known risk factors for VTE include smoking , obesity , and family history of VTE , in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ] .
A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol to the risk for users of other COCs , including COCs containing levonorgestrel .
Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1 .

Overall , there are two prospective cohort studies ( see Table 1 ) : the US post - approval safety study Ingenix [ Seeger 2007 ] , the European post - approval safety study EURAS ( European Active Surveillance Study ) [ Dinger 2007 ] .
An extension of the EURAS study , the Long - Term Active Surveillance Study ( LASS ) , did not enroll additional subjects , but continued to assess VTE risk .
There are three retrospective cohort studies : one study in the US funded by the FDA ( see Table 1 ) , and two from Denmark [ Lidegaard 2009 , Lidegaard 2011 ] .
There are two case - control studies : the Dutch MEGA study analysis [ van Hylckama Vlieg 2009 ] and the German case - control study [ Dinger 2010 ] .
There are two nested case - control studies that evaluated the risk of non - fatal idiopathic VTE : the PharMetrics study [ Jick 2011 ] and the GPRD study [ Parkin 2011 ] .
The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale ; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP , > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP .

The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10 , 000 woman - years .
The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use .
Data from a large , prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk , as compared to that in non - COC users , is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use .
Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting ( following a 4 week or greater pill - free interval ) the same or a different COC .
The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued .
Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives , for women who use oral contraceptives , for pregnant women , and for women in the postpartum period .
To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective : If 10 , 000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year , between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] If feasible , stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism .
Start drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery , in women who are not breastfeeding .
The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week , whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week .
Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions , especially in women with other risk factors for these events .
COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events ( thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes ) , although , in general , the risk is greatest among older ( > 35 years of age ) , hypertensive women who also smoke .
COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors .
Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors .
Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if there is unexplained loss of vision , proptosis , diplopia , papilledema , or retinal vascular lesions .
Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately .
[ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 ) ] 5 . 2 Hyperkalemia Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP , which has anti - mineralocorticoid activity , including the potential for hyperkalemia in high - risk patients , comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone .
Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia ( that is , renal impairment , hepatic impairment , and adrenal insufficiency ) .
Women receiving daily , long - term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle .
Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors , angiotensin – II receptor antagonists , potassium - sparing diuretics , potassium supplementation , heparin , aldosterone antagonists , and NSAIDs .
Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high - risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long - term and concomitantly .
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals ( e . g . ketoconazole , itraconazole , voriconazole ) , HIV / HCV protease inhibitors ( e . g . , indinavir , boceprevir ) , and clarithromycin [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Malignant Neoplasms Breast Cancer Syeda is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) and breast cancer risk .
Studies do not show an association between ever ( current or past ) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer .
However , some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users ( < 6 months since last use ) and current users with longer duration of COC use [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Cervical Cancer Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia .
However , there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors .
5 . 4 Liver Disease Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if jaundice develops .
Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function .
Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded .
Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use .
An estimate of the attributable risk is 3 . 3 cases / 100 , 000 COC users .
Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra - abdominal hemorrhage .
Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long - term ( > 8 years ) COC users .
However , the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users .
Oral contraceptive - related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy - related cholestasis .
Women with a history of COC - related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use .
5 . 5 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN , were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol - containing medications , such as COCs .
Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ] .
Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen .
5 . 6 High Blood Pressure For women with well - controlled hypertension , monitor blood pressure and stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if blood pressure rises significantly .
Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs .
An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs , and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use .
The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin .
5 . 7 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users .
5 . 8 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol .
COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose - related fashion .
Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia .
A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs .
Women with hypertriglyceridemia , or a family history thereof , may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs .
5 . 9 Headache If a woman taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol develops new headaches that are recurrent , persistent , or severe , evaluate the cause and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if indicated .
An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use ( which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event ) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC .
5 . 10 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled ( breakthrough or intracyclic ) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs , especially during the first three months of use .
If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles , check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy .
If pathology and pregnancy are excluded , bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC .
Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials ( N = 2 , 467 ) show that the percent of women who took drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12 % at cycle 2 to 6 % ( cycle 13 ) .
A total of 24 subjects out of 2 , 837 in the drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol trials ( < 1 % ) discontinued due to bleeding complaints .
These are described as metrorrhagia , vaginal hemorrhage , menorrhagia , abnormal withdrawal bleeding , and menometrorrhagia .
The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects ( 86 % to 88 % ) was 4 to 7 days .
Women who use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding , even if they are not pregnant .
Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials , during cycles 2 to 13 , 1 to 11 % of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding .
Some women may encounter post - pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea , especially when such a condition was pre - existent .
If withdrawal bleeding does not occur , consider the possibility of pregnancy .
If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule ( missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have ) , consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures .
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods , rule out pregnancy .
5 . 11 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy .
Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy , particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb - reduction defects are concerned .
The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [ see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 12 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree .
5 . 13 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests , such as coagulation factors , lipids , glucose tolerance , and binding proteins .
Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid - binding globulin increase with use of COCs [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti - mineralocorticoid activity .
5 . 14 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare .
5 . 15 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema , exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema .
Chloasma may occasionally occur , especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum .
Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling : • Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [ see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Vascular events [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Liver disease [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 4 ) ] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are : • Irregular uterine bleeding • Nausea • Breast tenderness • Headache The most frequent adverse reactions ( a2 % ) are premenstrual syndrome ( 13 . 2 % ) , headache / migraine ( 10 . 7 % ) , breast pain / tenderness / discomfort ( 8 . 3 % ) , nausea / vomiting ( 4 . 5 % ) , abdominal pain / tenderness / discomfort ( 2 . 3 % ) , mood changes ( 2 . 3 % ) .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data provided reflect the experience with the use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol ( 3 mg DRSP / 0 . 03 mg EE ) in the adequate and well - controlled studies for contraception ( N = 2 , 837 ) .
The US pivotal clinical study ( N = 326 ) was a multicenter , open - label trial in healthy women aged 18 to 35 who were treated for up to 13 cycles .
The second pivotal study ( N = 442 ) was a multicenter , randomized , open - label comparative European study of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol vs . 0 . 150 mg desogestrel / 0 . 03 mg EE conducted in healthy women aged 17 to 40 who were treated for up to 26 cycles .
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 2 % of users ) were : premenstrual syndrome ( 13 . 2 % ) , headache / migraine ( 10 . 7 % ) , breast pain / tenderness / discomfort ( 8 . 3 % ) , nausea / vomiting ( 4 . 5 % ) abdominal pain / discomfort / tenderness ( 2 . 3 % ) and mood changes ( depression , depressed mood , irritability , mood swings , mood altered and affect lability ( 2 . 3 % ) .
Adverse Reactions ( ≥ 1 % ) Leading to Study Discontinuation Of 2 , 837 women , 6 . 7 % discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction ; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was headache / migraine ( 1 . 5 % ) .
Serious Adverse Reactions Depression , pulmonary embolism , toxic skin eruption , and uterine leiomyoma .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Five studies that compared breast cancer risk between ever - users ( current or past use ) of COCs and never - users of COCs reported no association between ever use of COCs and breast cancer risk , with effect estimates ranging from 0 . 90 - 1 . 12 ( Figure 3 ) .
Three studies compared breast cancer risk between current or recent COC users ( < 6 months since last use ) and never users of COCs ( Figure 3 ) .
One of these studies reported no association between breast cancer risk and COC use .
The other two studies found an increased relative risk of 1 . 19 - 1 . 33 with current or recent use .
Both of these studies found an increased risk of breast cancer with current use of longer duration , with relative risks ranging from 1 . 03 with less than one year of COC use to approximately 1 . 4 with more than 8 - 10 years of COC use .
Figure 3 : Relative Studies of Risk of Breast Cancer with Combined Oral Contraceptives [ MULTIMEDIA ] RR = relative risk ; OR = odds ratio ; HR = hazard ratio .
“ ever COC ” are females with current or past COC use ; “ never COC use ” are females that never used COCs .
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Adverse reactions , including fatalities , are grouped into System Organ Classes and ordered by frequency .
Vascular disorders : Venous and arterial thromboembolic events ( including pulmonary emboli , deep vein thrombosis , intracardiac thrombosis , intracranial venous sinus thrombosis , sagittal sinus thrombosis , retinal vein occlusion , myocardial infarction and stroke ) , hypertension Hepatobiliary disorders : Gallbladder disease Immune system disorders : Hypersensitivity Metabolism and nutrition disorders : Hyperkalemia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Chloasma 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently - used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations .
Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes ( for example , CYP3A4 ) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding .
Counsel patients to use a back - up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs : Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes , including cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) , may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding .
Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin , barbiturates , carbamazepine , bosentan , felbamate , griseofulvin , oxcarbazepine , rifampin , topiramate and products containing St . John ’ s wort .
Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and / or contraceptive failure .
Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back - up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs , and to continue back - up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability .
Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs : Co - administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 % .
Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations , possibly by inhibition of conjugation .
Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , voriconazole , fluconazole ) , verapamil , macrolides ( e . g . , clarithromycin , erythromycin ) , diltiazem , and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both .
In a clinical drug - drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women , once daily co - administration of DRSP 3 mg / EE 0 . 02 mg .
Containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure .
The exposure of EE was increased mildly [ see WARINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) / Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) protease inhibitors and non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Significant changes ( increase or decrease ) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co - administration with HIV / HCV protease inhibitors or with non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors .
Antibiotics There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics , but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids .
7 . 2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds .
COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine , likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation .
This may reduce seizure control ; therefore , dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary .
Consult the labeling of the concurrently - use drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations .
COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes In clinical studies , administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates ( e . g . , midazolam ) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates ( e . g . , omeprazole and voriconazole ) and CYP1A2 substrates ( e . g . , theophylline and tizanidine ) can have a weak or moderate increase .
Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid - binding globulin increases with use of COCs .
Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation Do not co - administer drospirenone and ethinyl with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , due to potential for ALT elevations [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
7 . 4 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests , such as coagulation factors , lipids , glucose tolerance , and binding proteins .
DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti - mineralocorticoid activity [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 13 ) and DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers : Not recommended ; can decrease milk production .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy .
Epidemiologic studies and meta - analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non - genital birth defects ( including cardiac anomalies and limb - reduction defects ) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy .
The administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy .
COCs should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion .
Women who do not breastfeed may start COCs no earlier than four weeks postpartum .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers When possible , advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception until she has weaned her child .
Estrogen - containing COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers .
This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well - established ; however , it can occur at any time in some women .
Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and / or metabolites are present in breast milk .
After oral administration of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol , about 0 . 02 % of the DRSP dose was excreted into the breast milk of postpartum women within 24 hours .
This results in a maximal daily dose of about 0 . 003 mg DRSP in an infant .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol has been established in women of reproductive age .
Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older .
Use of this product before menarche is not indicated .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population .
8 . 6 Patients with Renal Impairment Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
In subjects with creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) of 50 to 79 mL / min , serum DRSP concentrations were comparable to those in a control group with CLcr 80 mL / min .
In subjects with CLcr of 30 to 49 mL / min , serum DRSP concentrations were on average 37 % higher than those in the control group .
In addition , there is a potential to develop hyperkalemia in subjects with renal impairment whose serum potassium is in the upper reference range , and who are concomitantly using potassium sparing drugs [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
The mean exposure to DRSP in women with moderate liver impairment is approximately three times higher than the exposure in women with normal liver function .
Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol has not been studied in women with severe hepatic impairment .
8 . 8 Race No clinically significant difference was observed between the pharmacokinetics of DRSP or EE in Japanese versus Caucasian women [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdose , including ingestion by children .
Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea .
DRSP is a spironolactone analogue which has anti - mineralocorticoid properties .
Serum concentration of potassium and sodium , and evidence of metabolic acidosis , should be monitored in cases of overdose .

Drospirenone ( 6 R , 7 R , 8 R , 9 S , 10 R , 13 S , 14 S , 15 S , 16 S , 17 S ) - 1 , 3 ' , 4 ' , 6 , 6 a , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 15 a , 16 - hexadecahydro - 10 , 13 - dimethylspiro - [ 17 H - dicyclopropa - [ 6 , 7 : 15 , 16 ] cyclopenta [ a ] phenanthrene - 17 , 2 ' ( 5 H ) - furan ] - 3 , 5 ' ( 2 H ) - dione ) is a synthetic progestational compound and has a molecular weight of 366 . 5 and a molecular formula of C24H30O3 .
Ethinyl estradiol ( 19 - nor - 17 - pregna 1 , 3 , 5 ( 10 ) - triene - 20 - yne - 3 , 17 - diol ) is a synthetic estrogenic compound and has a molecular weight of 296 . 4 and a molecular formula of C20H24O2 .
The structural formulas are as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation .
Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Drospirenone is a spironolactone analogue with anti - mineralocorticoid activity .
The estrogen in Syeda is ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) .
No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of DRSP from a single entity tablet is about 76 % .
The absolute bioavailability of EE is approximately 40 % as a result of presystemic conjugation and first - pass metabolism .
The absolute bioavailability of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol , which is a combination tablet of DRSP and EE , has not been evaluated .
Serum concentrations of DRSP and EE reached peak levels within 1 to 2 hours after administration of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol .
The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional following single doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg .
Following daily dosing of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol , steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 8 days .
There was about 2 to 3 fold accumulation in serum Cmax and AUC ( 0 - 24 h ) values of DRSP following multiple dose administration of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol ( see Table 2 ) .
For EE , steady - state conditions are reported during the second half of a treatment cycle .
Following daily administration of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol serum Cmax and AUC ( 0 - 24 h ) values of EE accumulate by a factor of about 1 . 5 to 2 ( see Table 2 ) .

The extent of absorption of DRSP , however , remained unchanged .
In contrast , the extent of absorption of EE was reduced by about 20 % under fed conditions .
Distribution DRSP and EE serum concentrations decline in two phases .
The apparent volume of distribution of DRSP is approximately 4 L / kg and that of EE is reported to be approximately 4 to 5 L / kg .
DRSP does not bind to sex hormone binding globulin ( SHBG ) or corticosteroid binding globulin ( CBG ) but binds about 97 % to other serum proteins .
Multiple dosing over 3 cycles resulted in no change in the free fraction ( as measured at trough concentrations ) .
EE is reported to be highly but non - specifically bound to serum albumin ( approximately 98 . 5 % ) and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of both SHBG and CBG .
EE induced effects on SHBG and CBG were not affected by variation of the DRSP dosage in the range of 2 to 3 mg .
Metabolism The two main metabolites of DRSP found in human plasma were identified to be the acid form of DRSP generated by opening of the lactone ring and the 4 , 5 - dihydrodrospirenone - 3 - sulfate , formed by reduction and subsequent sulfation .
These metabolites were shown not to be pharmacologically active .
Drospirenone is also subject to oxidative metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4 .
EE has been reported to be subject to significant gut and hepatic first - pass metabolism .
Metabolism of EE and its oxidative metabolites occur primarily by conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate .
CYP3A4 in the liver is responsible for the 2 - hydroxylation which is the major oxidative reaction .
The 2 - hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion .
Excretion DRSP serum concentrations are characterized by a terminal disposition phase half - life of approximately 30 hours after both single and multiple dose regimens .
Excretion of DRSP was nearly complete after ten days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine .
DRSP was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged DRSP were excreted in urine and feces .
At least 20 different metabolites were observed in urine and feces .
About 38 to 47 % of the metabolites in urine were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates .
In feces , about 17 to 20 % of the metabolites were excreted as glucuronides and sulfates .
For EE the terminal disposition phase half - life has been reported to be approximately 24 hours .
EE is not excreted unchanged .
EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and undergoes enterohepatic circulation .
Use in Specific Populations Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol has been established in women of reproductive age .
Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older .
Use of this product before menarche is not indicated .
Geriatric Use Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population .
Race No clinically significant difference was observed between the pharmacokinetics of DRSP or EE in Japanese versus Caucasian women ( age 25 to 35 ) when 3 mg DRSP / 0 . 02 mg EE was administered daily for 21 days .
Other ethnic groups have not been specifically studied .
Renal Impairment Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment .
The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DRSP ( 3 mg daily for 14 days ) and the effect of DRSP on serum potassium concentrations were investigated in three separate groups of female subjects ( n = 28 , age 30 to 65 ) .
All subjects were on a low potassium diet .
During the study , 7 subjects continued the use of potassium - sparing drugs for the treatment of their underlying illness .
On the 14 th day ( steady - state ) of DRSP treatment , the serum DRSP concentrations in the group with CLcr of 50 to 79 mL / min were comparable to those in the control group with CLcr ≥ 80 mL / min .
The serum DRSP concentrations were on average 37 % higher in the group with CLcr of 30 to 49 mL / min compared to those in the control group .
DRSP treatment did not show any clinically significant effect on serum potassium concentration .
Although hyperkalemia was not observed in the study , in five of the seven subjects who continued use of potassium sparing drugs during the study , mean serum potassium concentrations increased by up to 0 . 33 mEq / L .
[ See CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease .
The mean exposure to DRSP in women with moderate liver impairment is approximately three times higher than the exposure in women with normal liver function .
Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol has not been studied in women with severe hepatic impairment [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Drug Interactions Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with oral contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations .
Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes , including CYP3A4 , may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding .
Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs Co - administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20 % .
Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations , possibly by inhibition of conjugation .
In a clinical drug - drug interaction study conducted in 20 premenopausal women , co - administration of a DRSP ( 3 mg ) / EE ( 0 . 02 mg ) COC with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole ( 200 mg twice daily ) for 10 days increased the AUC ( 0 - 24 h ) of DRSP and EE by 2 . 68 - fold ( 90 % CI : 2 . 44 , 2 . 95 ) and 1 . 40 - fold ( 90 % CI : 1 . 31 , 1 . 49 ) , respectively .
The increases in Cmax were 1 . 97 - fold ( 90 % CI : 1 . 79 , 2 . 17 ) and 1 . 39 - fold ( 90 % CI : 1 . 28 , 1 . 52 ) for DRSP and EE , respectively .
Although no clinically relevant effects on safety or laboratory parameters including serum potassium were observed , this study only assessed subjects for 10 days .
The clinical impact for a patient taking a DRSP - containing COC concomitantly with chronic use of a CYP3A4 / 5 inhibitor is unknown [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
HIV / HCV protease inhibitors and non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Significant changes ( increase or decrease ) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co - administration with HIV / HCV protease inhibitors or with non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors .
Antibiotics There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics , but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids .
Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds .
COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine , likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation .
This may reduce seizure control ; therefore , dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary .
Consult the labeling of the concurrently - used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations .
In vitro , EE is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19 , CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 as well as a mechanism - based inhibitor of CYP3A4 / 5 , CYP2C8 , and CYP2J2 .
Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic CYP enzymes have been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies .
In in vitro studies DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 , but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , and CYP3A4 , with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme .
The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate .
In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [ including 12 women with homozygous ( wild type ) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype ] the daily oral administration of 3 mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the oral clearance of omeprazole ( 40 mg , single oral dose ) and the CYP2C19 product 5 - hydroxy omeprazole .
Furthermore , no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found .
These results demonstrate that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo .
Two additional clinical drug - drug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4 were each performed in 24 healthy postmenopausal women .
The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steady state DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSP / day .
Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid - binding globulin increases with use of COCs .
Interactions With Drugs That Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
A drug - drug interaction study of DRSP 3 mg / estradiol ( E2 ) 1 mg versus placebo was performed in 24 mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily .
Potassium concentrations were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects .
Mean serum potassium concentrations in the DRSP / E2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0 . 22 mEq / L higher than those in the placebo group .
Serum potassium concentrations also were measured at multiple time points over 24 hours at baseline and on Day 14 .
On Day 14 , the ratios for serum potassium Cmax and AUC in the DRSP / E2 group to those in the placebo group were 0 . 955 ( 90 % CI : 0 . 914 , 0 . 999 ) and 1 . 010 ( 90 % CI : 0 . 944 , 1 . 08 ) , respectively .
No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia ( serum potassium concentrations > 5 . 5 mEq / L ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 24 month oral carcinogenicity study in mice dosed with 10 mg / kg / day DRSP alone or 1 + 0 . 01 , 3 + 0 . 03 and 10 + 0 . 1 mg / kg / day of DRSP and EE , 0 . 1 to 2 times the exposure ( AUC of DRSP ) of women taking a contraceptive dose , there was an increase in carcinomas of the harderian gland in the group that received the high dose of DRSP alone .
In a similar study in rats given 10 mg / kg / day DRSP alone or 0 . 3 + 0 . 003 , 3 + 0 . 03 and 10 + 0 . 1 mg / kg / day DRSP and EE , 0 . 8 to 10 times the exposure of women taking a contraceptive dose , there was an increased incidence of benign and total ( benign and malignant ) adrenal gland pheochromocytomas in the group receiving the high dose of DRSP .
Mutagenesis studies for DRSP were conducted in vivo and in vitro and no evidence of mutagenic activity was observed .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES In the clinical efficacy studies of up to 2 years duration , 2 , 629 subjects completed 33 , 160 cycles of use without any other contraception .

What are the Most Serious Risks of Taking Birth Control Pills ?

This increased risk is highest when you first start taking birth control pills and when you restart the same or different birth control pills after not using them for a month or more .
Women who use birth control pills with drospirenone ( like Syeda ) may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot .

Talk with your healthcare provider about your risk of getting a blood clot before deciding which birth control pill is right for you .
