2 . 3 Preparation and Administration in Parenteral Nutrition • POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION is for intravenous infusion into a peripheral or central vein only after dilution and admixing .
• POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION is to be prepared only in a suitable work area such as a laminar flow hood ( or an equivalent clean air compounding area ) .
The key factor in the preparation is careful aseptic technique to avoid inadvertent touch contamination during mixing of solutions and addition of other nutrients .
• Transfer the required amount of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION to the parenteral nutrition solution following the admixture of amino acids , dextrose , electrolytes solutions , and prior to lipids ( if added ) .
• Because additives may be incompatible , evaluate all additions to the parenteral nutrition container for compatibility and stability of the resulting preparation .
• Calcium and phosphate ratios must be considered .
Excess addition of calcium and phosphate , especially in the form of mineral salts , may result in the formation of calcium - phosphate precipitates [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Calcium - phosphate stability in parenteral nutrition solutions is dependent upon the pH of the solution , temperature , and relative concentration of each ion .
Discard if any precipitates are observed .
• Inspect the final parenteral solution containing POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION to ensure that : • precipitates have not formed during mixing or addition of additives and inspect again before administration .
• the emulsion has not separated , if lipids have been added .
Separation of the emulsion can be visibly identified by a yellowish streaking or the accumulation of yellowish droplets in the admixed emulsion .
• The final parenteral nutrition solution is for intravenous infusion into a peripheral or central vein .
The choice of a peripheral or central venous route should depend on the osmolarity of the final infusate .
Solutions with osmolarity of 900 mOsm / L or greater must be infused through a central catheter [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Storage and Stability • For single use only .
Discard used vial , including any unused contents .
• Use parenteral nutrition solution promptly after mixing .
Any storage of the admixture should be under refrigeration from 2 ° C to 8 ° C ( 36 ° F to 46 ° F ) and limited to a brief period of time , no longer than 24 hours .
After removal from refrigeration , bring to room temperature and use promptly and complete the infusion within 24 hours .
Discard any remaining admixture .
• Protect the parenteral nutrition solution from light during storage .
2 . 4 Dosage for Administration in Parenteral Nutrition POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION provides phosphorus 3 mmol / mL ( potassium 4 . 7 mEq / mL ) .
The recommended and maximum daily dosage in parenteral nutrition is shown in Table 2 .
Individualize the dosage based upon the patient ’ s clinical condition , nutritional requirements , and the contribution of oral or enteral phosphorus and potassium intake .
The amount of phosphorus that can be added to parenteral nutrition may be limited by the amount of calcium that is also added to the solution .

In addition , inappropriate intravenous administration of undiluted or insufficiently diluted potassium phosphates as a rapid “ IV push ” has resulted in cardiac arrest , cardiac arrhythmias , hypotension , and death .
POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION is for intravenous infusion only after dilution or admixing .
The maximum initial or single dose of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia is phosphorus 45 mmol ( potassium 71 mEq ) .
The recommended infusion rate is approximately phosphorus 6 . 4 mmol / hour ( potassium 10 mEq / hour ) .
Continuous electrocardiographic ( ECG ) monitoring is recommended for higher infusion rates [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Pulmonary Embolism due to Pulmonary Vascular Precipitates Pulmonary vascular emboli and pulmonary distress related to precipitates in the pulmonary vasculature have been described in patients receiving admixed products containing calcium and phosphates or parenteral nutrition .
The cause of precipitate formation has not been determined in all cases ; however , in some fatal cases , pulmonary emboli occurred as a result of calcium phosphate precipitates .
Precipitation has occurred following passage through an in - line filter ; in vivo precipitate formation may also have occurred .
If signs of pulmonary distress occur , stop the parenteral nutrition infusion and initiate a medical evaluation .
In addition to inspection of the solution [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 3 ) ] , the infusion set and catheter should also periodically be checked for precipitates .
5 . 3 Hyperkalemia POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION may increase the risk of hyperkalemia , including life - threatening cardiac events , especially when administered in excessive doses , undiluted or by rapid intravenous infusion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease are at increased risk of developing life - threatening hyperkalemia , when administered intravenous potassium [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Other patients at increased risk of hyperkalemia include those with severe adrenal insufficiency or treated concurrently with other drugs that cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with cardiac disease may be more susceptible to the effects of hyperkalemia .
Consider the amount of potassium from all sources when determining the dose of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION and do not exceed the maximum age - appropriate recommended daily amount of potassium .
In patients with moderate renal impairment ( eGFR ≥ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 to < 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , start at the low end of the dose range and monitor serum potassium , phosphorus , calcium , and magnesium concentrations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 4 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
When administering POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia , check the serum potassium concentration prior to administration .
If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq / dL or more , do not administer POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION and use an alternative source of phosphate [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
The maximum initial or single dose of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia is phosphorus 45 mmol ( potassium 71 mEq ) .
The recommended infusion rate of potassium is 10 mEq / hour .
Continuous electrocardiographic ( ECG ) monitoring is recommended for higher infusion rates of potassium [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 4 Hyperphosphatemia and Hypocalcemia Hyperphosphatemia can occur with intravenous administration of potassium phosphates , especially in patients with renal impairment .
Hyperphosphatemia can cause the formation of insoluble calcium phosphorus products with consequent hypocalcemia , neurological irritability with tetany , nephrocalcinosis with acute kidney injury and more rarely , cardiac irritability with arrhythmias .
Obtain serum calcium concentrations prior to administration and normalize the calcium before administering POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION .
POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION is contraindicated in patients with hyperphosphatemia and / or hypercalcemia [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Monitor serum phosphorus and calcium concentrations during treatment with POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 5 Aluminum Toxicity POTASSIUM PHOSHATES INJECTION contains aluminum that may be toxic .
Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment .
Preterm infants are particularly at risk for aluminum toxicity because their kidneys are immature , and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions , which also contain aluminum .
Patients with renal impairment , including preterm infants , who receive greater than 4 to 5 mcg / kg / day of parenteral aluminum can accumulate aluminum to levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity .
Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration .
Exposure to aluminum from POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION is not more than 4 . 9 mcg / kg / day when : • adults weighing at least 45 kg are administered the recommended maximum dosage of phosphorus ( 45 mmol / day ) for parenteral nutrition .
• pediatric patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg are administered the recommended maximum dosage of phosphorus ( 40 mmol / day ) for parenteral nutrition [ see Dosage and Administrations ( 2 . 4 ) , Description ( 11 ) ] .
When prescribing POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION for use in parenteral nutrition solutions containing other small volume parenteral products , the total daily patient exposure to aluminium from the admixture should be considered and maintained at no more than 5 mcg / kg / day [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION for parenteral nutrition is not recommended in adults weighing less than 45 kg or pediatric patients less than 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg due to the risks of aluminum toxicity [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 6 Hypomagnesemia Intravenous infusion of phosphate has been reported to cause a decrease in serum magnesium ( and calcium ) concentrations when administered to patients with hypercalcemia and diabetic ketoacidosis .
Monitor serum magnesium concentrations during treatment .
5 . 7 Vein Damage and Thrombosis POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION must be diluted and administered in intravenous fluids or used as an admixture in parenteral nutrition .
It is not for direct intravenous infusion .
The infusion of hypertonic solutions into a peripheral vein may result in vein irritation , vein damage , and / or thrombosis .
The primary complication of peripheral administration is venous thrombophlebitis , which manifests as pain , erythema , tenderness or a palpable cord .
Remove the catheter as soon as possible and initiate appropriate medical treatment if thrombophlebitis develops .
When administered peripherally in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia , a generally recommended maximum concentration is phosphorus 6 . 4 mmol / 100 mL ( potassium 10 mEq / 100 mL ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] Parenteral nutrition solutions with an osmolarity of 900 mOsm / L or greater must be infused through a central catheter [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 8 Laboratory Monitoring Monitor serum phosphorus , potassium , calcium and magnesium concentrations during treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 4 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Aluminum Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Hypomagnesemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Vein Damage and Thrombosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] The following adverse reactions in Table 3 have been reported in clinical studies or postmarketing reports in patients receiving intravenously administered potassium phosphates .
Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .

Avoid use of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION in patients receiving such products .
If use cannot be avoided , closely monitor serum potassium concentrations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Administration of the approved recommended dose of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION is not expected to cause major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with intravenous potassium phosphates .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated Maternal and / or Embryo - Fetal Risk Phosphorus is an essential mineral element .
Parenteral supplementation with potassium phosphates should be considered if a pregnant woman ’ s requirements cannot be fulfilled by oral or enteral intake .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Phosphorus and potassium are present in human milk .
Administration of the approved recommended dose of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION is not expected to cause harm to a breastfed infant .
There is no information on the effects of potassium phosphates on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION have been established in : • pediatric patients 12 years and older as a source of phosphorus in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia when oral or enteral replacement is not possible , insufficient , or contraindicated .
• pediatric patients 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg as a source of phosphorus for parenteral nutrition when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible , insufficient , or contraindicated .
The safety of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION for parenteral nutrition has not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age or in adolescents weighing less than 40 kg due to the risk of aluminum toxicity [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In general , dose selection of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION for an elderly patient should be cautious , starting at the low end of the dosing range because of the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
It may be useful to monitor renal function during treatment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Potassium and phosphorus are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of adverse reactions to POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION may be greater in patients with impaired renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 , 5 . 4 , 5 . 5 ) ] .
POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION is contraindicated due to the risk of hyperkalemia in patients with severe renal impairment ( eGFR less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) or end stage renal disease [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
In patients with moderate renal impairment ( eGFR ≥ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 to < 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , start at the low end of the dosage range and monitor serum potassium , phosphorus , calcium , and magnesium concentrations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 4 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Hyperphosphatemia Administration of excessive doses of intravenous potassium phosphates in intravenous fluids as a single dose ranging from approximately 50 to 270 mmol and / or at rapid infusion rates ( over 1 to 3 hours ) has resulted in death , cardiac arrest , cardiac arrhythmia ( including QT prolongation ) , hyperkalemia , hyperphosphatemia , seizures , and tetany .
Hyperphosphatemia is particularly a risk in patients with renal failure .
Hyperphosphatemia leads in turn to hypocalcemia , which may be severe , and to ectopic calcification , particularly in patients with initial hypercalcemia .
Tissue calcification may cause hypotension and organ damage and result in acute renal failure .
Hyperkalemia Excessive administration of phosphates given as potassium salts may also cause hyperkalemia .
Manifestations of hyperkalemia include : • Disturbances in cardiac conduction and arrhythmias , including bradycardia , heart block , asystole , ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation • Hypotension • Muscle weakness including paresthesia , muscular and respiratory paralysis Management In the event of overdosage , discontinue infusions containing potassium phosphates immediately and institute general supportive measures , including ECG monitoring , laboratory monitoring , and correction of serum electrolyte concentrations , especially potassium , phosphorus , calcium , and magnesium .
