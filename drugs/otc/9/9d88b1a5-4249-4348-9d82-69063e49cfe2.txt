( 4 , 5 . 3 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Ketoacidosis : Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis , regardless of blood glucose level .
If suspected , discontinue , evaluate , and treat promptly .
Before initiating , consider risk factors for ketoacidosis .
Patients may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis .
( 5 . 1 ) • Lower Limb Amputation : Consider factors that may increase the risk of amputation before initiating STEGLATRO .
Monitor patients for infections or ulcers of lower limbs , and discontinue if these occur .
( 5 . 2 ) • Volume Depletion : May result in acute kidney injury .
Before initiating , assess and correct volume status in patients with renal impairment or low systolic blood pressure , elderly patients , or patients on diuretics .
Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy .
( 5 . 3 ) • Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis : Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly , if indicated .
( 5 . 4 ) • Hypoglycemia : Consider a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue to reduce risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination .
( 5 . 5 ) • Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum ( Fournier ' s Gangrene ) : Serious , life - threatening cases have occurred in both females and males .
Assess patients presenting with pain or tenderness , erythema , or swelling in the genital or perineal area , along with fever or malaise .
If suspected , institute prompt treatment .
( 5 . 6 ) • Genital Mycotic Infections : Monitor and treat if indicated .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Ketoacidosis Reports of ketoacidosis , a serious life - threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization , have been identified in clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodium glucose co - transporter - 2 ( SGLT2 ) inhibitors including STEGLATRO [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors .
In placebo - controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes , the risk of ketoacidosis was increased in patients who received SGLT2 inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo .
The risk of ketoacidosis may be greater with higher doses .
STEGLATRO is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Patients treated with STEGLATRO who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels , as ketoacidosis associated with STEGLATRO may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg / dL .
If ketoacidosis is suspected , STEGLATRO should be discontinued , patient should be evaluated , and prompt treatment should be instituted .
Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin , fluid and carbohydrate replacement .
In many of the reported cases , and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes , the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis ( often less than 250 mg / dL ) .
Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , generalized malaise , and shortness of breath .
In some but not all cases , factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction , acute febrile illness , reduced caloric intake , surgery , pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency ( e . g . , type 1 diabetes , history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery ) , and alcohol abuse were identified .
Before initiating STEGLATRO , consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis , including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause , caloric restriction , and alcohol abuse .
For patients who undergo scheduled surgery , consider temporarily discontinuing STEGLATRO for at least 4 days prior to surgery [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) ] .
Consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing STEGLATRO in other clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis ( e . g . , prolonged fasting due to acute illness or post - surgery ) .
Ensure risk factors for ketoacidosis are resolved prior to restarting STEGLATRO .
Educate patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue STEGLATRO and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur .
5 . 2 Lower Limb Amputation In a long - term cardiovascular outcomes study [ see Clinical Studies 14 . 2 ] , in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease , the occurrence of non - traumatic lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 4 . 7 , 5 . 7 , and 6 . 0 events per 1000 patient - years in the placebo , ertugliflozin 5 mg , and ertugliflozin 15 mg treatment arms , respectively .
Amputation of the toe and foot were most frequent ( 81 out of 109 patients with lower limb amputations ) .
Some patients had multiple amputations , some involving both lower limbs .
Lower limb infections , gangrene , and diabetic foot ulcers were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation .
Patients with amputations were more likely to be male , have higher A1C ( % ) at baseline , have a history of peripheral arterial disease , amputation or peripheral revascularization procedure , diabetic foot , and to have been taking diuretics or insulin .
Across seven STEGLATRO clinical trials , non - traumatic lower limb amputations were reported in 1 ( 0 . 1 % ) patient in the comparator group , 3 ( 0 . 2 % ) patients in the STEGLATRO 5 mg group , and 8 ( 0 . 5 % ) patients in the STEGLATRO 15 mg group .
Before initiating STEGLATRO , consider factors in the patient history that may predispose them to the need for amputations , such as a history of prior amputation , peripheral vascular disease , neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcers .
Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care .
Monitor patients receiving STEGLATRO for signs and symptoms of infection ( including osteomyelitis ) , new pain or tenderness , sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs , and discontinue STEGLATRO if these complications occur .
5 . 3 Volume Depletion STEGLATRO can cause intravascular volume contraction which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury , some requiring hospitalization and dialysis , in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors , including STEGLATRO .
Patients with impaired renal function ( eGFR less than 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] , elderly patients , patients with low systolic blood pressure , or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension .
Before initiating STEGLATRO in patients with one or more of these characteristics , assess volume status and renal function .
In patients with volume depletion , correct this condition before initiating STEGLATRO .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion , and renal function after initiating therapy .
5 . 4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections , including urosepsis and pyelonephritis , requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors .
Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections .
Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly , if indicated [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) are known to cause hypoglycemia .
STEGLATRO may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and / or an insulin secretagogue [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Therefore , a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with STEGLATRO .
5 . 6 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum ( Fournier ' s Gangrene ) Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum ( Fournier ' s Gangrene ) , a rare but serious and life - threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention , have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors , including STEGLATRO .
Cases have been reported in females and males .
Serious outcomes have included hospitalization , multiple surgeries , and death .
Patients treated with STEGLATRO presenting with pain or tenderness , erythema , or swelling in the genital or perineal area , along with fever or malaise , should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis .
If suspected , start treatment immediately with broad - spectrum antibiotics and , if necessary , surgical debridement .
Discontinue STEGLATRO , closely monitor blood glucose levels , and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control .
5 . 7 Genital Mycotic Infections STEGLATRO increases the risk of genital mycotic infections .
Patients who have a history of genital mycotic infections or who are uncircumcised are more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor and treat appropriately .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Ketoacidosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Lower Limb Amputation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Volume Depletion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum ( Fournier ' s Gangrene ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Genital Mycotic Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 5 % ) were female genital mycotic infections .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Pool of Placebo - Controlled Trials Evaluating STEGLATRO 5 and 15 mg The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of three 26 - week , placebo - controlled trials .
STEGLATRO was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add - on therapy in two trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
These data reflect exposure of 1 , 029 patients to STEGLATRO with a mean exposure duration of approximately 25 weeks .
Patients received STEGLATRO 5 mg ( N = 519 ) , STEGLATRO 15 mg ( N = 510 ) , or placebo ( N = 515 ) once daily .
The mean age of the population was 57 years and 2 % were older than 75 years of age .
Fifty - three percent ( 53 % ) of the population was male and 73 % were Caucasian , 15 % were Asian , and 7 % were Black or African American .
At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7 . 5 years , had a mean HbA1c of 8 . 1 % , and 19 . 4 % had established microvascular complications of diabetes .
Baseline renal function ( mean eGFR 88 . 9 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) was normal or mildly impaired in 97 % of patients and moderately impaired in 3 % of patients .
Table 1 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of STEGLATRO .
These adverse reactions were not present at baseline , occurred more commonly on STEGLATRO than on placebo , and occurred in at least 2 % of patients treated with either STEGLATRO 5 mg or STEGLATRO 15 mg .

Ketoacidosis In a long - term cardiovascular outcomes study VERTIS CV ( eValuation of ERTugliflozin effIcacy and Safety , CardioVascular , [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] , a study in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease , ketoacidosis was identified in 19 ( 0 . 3 % ) STEGLATRO - treated patients and in 2 ( 0 . 1 % ) placebo treated patients .
Across seven other STEGLATRO clinical trials , ketoacidosis was identified in 3 ( 0 . 1 % ) STEGLATRO - treated patients and 0 . 0 % of comparator - treated patients .
Volume Depletion STEGLATRO causes an osmotic diuresis , which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion , particularly in patients with impaired renal function ( eGFR less than 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
In patients with moderate renal impairment , adverse reactions related to volume depletion ( e . g . , dehydration , dizziness postural , presyncope , syncope , hypotension , and orthostatic hypotension ) were reported in 0 % , 4 . 4 % , and 1 . 9 % of patients treated with placebo , STEGLATRO 5 mg , and STEGLATRO 15 mg , respectively .
STEGLATRO may also increase the risk of hypotension in other patients at risk for volume contraction [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 , 8 . 6 ) ] .
Hypoglycemia The incidence of hypoglycemia by study is shown in Table 2 .
Table 2 : Incidence of Overall [ 1 ] and Severe [ 2 ] Hypoglycemia in Placebo - Controlled Clinical Studies in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes MellitusMonotherapy ( 26 weeks ) Placebo ( N = 153 ) STEGLATRO 5 mg ( N = 156 ) STEGLATRO 15 mg ( N = 152 ) Overall [ N ( % ) ] 1 ( 0 . 7 ) 4 ( 2 . 6 ) 4 ( 2 . 6 ) Severe [ N ( % ) ] 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 2 ( 1 . 3 ) Add - on Combination Therapy with Metformin ( 26 weeks ) Placebo ( N = 209 ) STEGLATRO 5 mg ( N = 207 ) STEGLATRO 15 mg ( N = 205 ) Overall [ N ( % ) ] 9 ( 4 . 3 ) 15 ( 7 . 2 ) 16 ( 7 . 8 ) Severe [ N ( % ) ] 1 ( 0 . 5 ) 1 ( 0 . 5 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Add - on Combination Therapy with Metformin and Sitagliptin ( 26 weeks ) Placebo ( N = 153 ) STEGLATRO 5 mg ( N = 156 ) STEGLATRO 15 mg ( N = 153 ) Overall [ N ( % ) ] 5 ( 3 . 3 ) 7 ( 4 . 5 ) 3 ( 2 . 0 ) Severe [ N ( % ) ] 1 ( 0 . 7 ) 1 ( 0 . 6 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) In Combination with Insulin and / or an Insulin Secretagogue in Patients with Moderate Renal Impairment ( 26 weeks ) Placebo ( N = 133 ) STEGLATRO 5 mg ( N = 148 ) STEGLATRO 15 mg ( N = 143 ) Overall [ N ( % ) ] 48 ( 36 . 1 ) 53 ( 35 . 8 ) 39 ( 27 . 3 ) Severe [ N ( % ) ] 3 ( 2 . 3 ) 5 ( 3 . 4 ) 3 ( 2 . 1 ) Add - on Combination with Insulin with or without Metformin ( 18 weeks ) Placebo ( N = 347 ) STEGLATRO 5 mg ( N = 348 ) STEGLATRO 15 mg ( N = 370 ) Overall [ N ( % ) ] 130 ( 37 . 5 ) 137 ( 39 . 4 ) 144 ( 38 . 9 ) Severe [ N ( % ) ] 12 ( 3 . 5 ) 13 ( 3 . 7 ) 19 ( 5 . 1 ) Add - on Combination with a Sulfonylurea ( 18 weeks ) Placebo ( N = 48 ) STEGLATRO 5 mg ( N = 55 ) STEGLATRO 15 mg ( N = 54 ) Overall [ N ( % ) ] 2 ( 4 . 2 ) 4 ( 7 . 3 ) 5 ( 9 . 3 ) Severe [ N ( % ) ] 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Add - on Combination with Metformin and a Sulfonylurea ( 18 weeks ) Placebo ( N = 117 ) STEGLATRO 5 mg ( N = 100 ) STEGLATRO 15 mg ( N = 113 ) Overall [ N ( % ) ] 17 ( 14 . 5 ) 20 ( 20 . 0 ) 30 ( 26 . 5 ) Severe [ N ( % ) ] 1 ( 0 . 9 ) 2 ( 2 . 0 ) 2 ( 1 . 8 ) [ 1 ] Overall hypoglycemic events : plasma or capillary glucose of less than or equal to 70 mg / dL .
[ 2 ] Severe hypoglycemic events : required assistance , lost consciousness , or experienced a seizure regardless of blood glucose .
Genital Mycotic Infections In the pool of three placebo - controlled clinical trials , the incidence of female genital mycotic infections ( e . g . , genital candidiasis , genital infection fungal , vaginal infection , vulvitis , vulvovaginal candidiasis , vulvovaginal mycotic infection , vulvovaginitis ) occurred in 3 % , 9 . 1 % , and 12 . 2 % of females treated with placebo , STEGLATRO 5 mg , and STEGLATRO 15 mg , respectively ( see Table 1 ) .
In females , discontinuation due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0 % and 0 . 6 % of patients treated with placebo and STEGLATRO , respectively .
In the same pool , male genital mycotic infections ( e . g . , balanitis candida , balanoposthitis , genital infection , genital infection fungal ) occurred in 0 . 4 % , 3 . 7 % , and 4 . 2 % of males treated with placebo , STEGLATRO 5 mg , and STEGLATRO 15 mg , respectively ( see Table 1 ) .
Male genital mycotic infections occurred more commonly in uncircumcised males .
In males , discontinuations due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0 % and 0 . 2 % of patients treated with placebo and STEGLATRO , respectively .
Phimosis was reported in 8 of 1729 ( 0 . 5 % ) male ertugliflozin - treated patients , of which four required circumcision .
Urinary Tract Infections In VERTIS CV , urinary tract infections ( e . g . , urinary tract infection , cystitis , dysuria ) occurred in 10 . 2 % , 12 . 2 % and 12 . 0 % of patients treated with placebo , STEGLATRO 5 mg and STEGLATRO 15 mg , respectively .
The incidences of serious urinary tract infections were 0 . 8 % , 0 . 9 % and 0 . 4 % with placebo , STEGLATRO 5 mg and STEGLATRO 15 mg , respectively .
Laboratory Tests Changes in Serum Creatinine and eGFR Initiation of STEGLATRO causes an increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR within weeks of starting therapy and then these changes stabilize .
In a study of patients with moderate renal impairment , larger mean changes were observed .
In a long - term cardiovascular outcomes trial , an initial increase in serum creatinine and a decrease in eGFR within weeks of starting therapy was observed ( at Week 6 eGFR changes of - 2 . 7 , - 3 . 8 and - 0 . 4 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 in the STEGLATRO 5 mg , STEGLATRO 15 mg and placebo arms , respectively ) .
The initial decline was followed by a recovery toward baseline to Week 52 ( eGFR change from baseline of - 0 . 4 , - 1 . 1 and - 0 . 2 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 in STEGLATRO 5 mg , STEGLATRO 15 mg , and placebo arms , respectively ) .
Acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the early renal function changes observed with STEGLATRO since they are reversed after treatment discontinuation .
Increases in Low - Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ( LDL - C ) In the pool of three placebo - controlled trials , dose - related increases in LDL - C were observed in patients treated with STEGLATRO .
Mean percent changes from baseline to Week 26 in LDL - C relative to placebo were 2 . 6 % and 5 . 4 % with STEGLATRO 5 mg and STEGLATRO 15 mg , respectively .
The range of mean baseline LDL - C was 96 . 6 to 97 . 7 mg / dL across treatment groups .
Increases in Hemoglobin In the pool of three placebo - controlled trials , mean changes ( percent changes ) from baseline to Week 26 in hemoglobin were - 0 . 21 g / dL ( - 1 . 4 % ) with placebo , 0 . 46 g / dL ( 3 . 5 % ) with STEGLATRO 5 mg , and 0 . 48 g / dL ( 3 . 5 % ) with STEGLATRO 15 mg .
The range of mean baseline hemoglobin was 13 . 90 to 14 . 00 g / dL across treatment groups .
At the end of treatment , 0 . 0 % , 0 . 2 % , and 0 . 4 % of patients treated with placebo , STEGLATRO 5 mg , and STEGLATRO 15 mg , respectively , had a hemoglobin increase greater than 2 g / dL and above the upper limit of normal .
Increases in Serum Phosphate In the pool of three placebo - controlled trials , mean changes ( percent changes ) from baseline in serum phosphate were 0 . 04 mg / dL ( 1 . 9 % ) with placebo , 0 . 21 mg / dL ( 6 . 8 % ) with STEGLATRO 5 mg , and 0 . 26 mg / dL ( 8 . 5 % ) with STEGLATRO 15 mg .
The range of mean baseline serum phosphate was 3 . 53 to 3 . 54 mg / dL across treatment groups .
In a clinical trial of patients with moderate renal impairment , mean changes ( percent changes ) from baseline at Week 26 in serum phosphate were - 0 . 01 mg / dL ( 0 . 8 % ) with placebo , 0 . 29 mg / dL ( 9 . 7 % ) with STEGLATRO 5 mg , and 0 . 24 mg / dL ( 7 . 8 % ) with STEGLATRO 15 mg .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum ( Fournier ' s Gangrene ) • Angioedema 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 3 : Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with STEGLATROInsulin and Insulin Secretagogues Clinical Impact : The risk of hypoglycemia when STEGLATRO is used in combination with insulin and / or an insulin secretagogue .
Intervention : A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with STEGLATRO .
Lithium Clinical Impact : Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations .
Intervention : Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during STEGLATRO initiation and dosage changes .
Positive Urine Glucose Test Clinical Impact : SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests .
Intervention : Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors .
Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control .
Interference with 1 , 5 - anhydroglucitol ( 1 , 5 - AG ) Assay Clinical Impact : Measurements of 1 , 5 - AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors .
Intervention : Monitoring glycemic control with 1 , 5 - AG assay is not recommended .
Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control .

( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Advise females of the potential risk to a fetus especially during the second and third trimesters .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended .
( 8 . 2 ) • Geriatrics : Higher incidence of adverse reactions related to reduced intravascular volume .
( 5 . 3 , 8 . 5 ) • Renal Impairment : Higher incidence of adverse reactions related to reduced intravascular volume and renal function .
( 5 . 3 , 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal data showing adverse renal effects , STEGLATRO is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy .
The limited available data with STEGLATRO in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
In animal studies , adverse renal changes were observed in rats when ertugliflozin was administered during a period of renal development corresponding to the late second and third trimesters of human pregnancy .
Doses approximately 13 times the maximum clinical dose caused renal pelvic and tubule dilatations and renal mineralization that were not fully reversible .
There was no evidence of fetal harm in rats or rabbits at exposures of ertugliflozin approximately 300 times higher than the maximal clinical dose of 15 mg / day when administered during organogenesis ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 - 10 % in women with pre - gestational diabetes with a HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 - 25 % in women with HbA1c > 10 .
The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo / Fetal Risk Poorly - controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , pre - eclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery , and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , stillbirth , and macrosomia related morbidity .
Data Animal Data When ertugliflozin was orally administered to juvenile rats from PND 21 to PND 90 , increased kidney weight , renal tubule and renal pelvis dilatation , and renal mineralization occurred at doses greater than or equal to 5 mg / kg ( 13 - fold human exposures , based on AUC ) .
These effects occurred with drug exposure during periods of renal development in rats that correspond to the late second and third trimester of human renal development , and did not fully reverse within a 1 - month recovery period .
In embryo - fetal development studies , ertugliflozin ( 50 , 100 and 250 mg / kg / day ) was administered orally to rats on gestation days 6 to 17 and to rabbits on gestation days 7 to 19 .
Ertugliflozin did not adversely affect developmental outcomes in rats and rabbits at maternal exposures that were approximately 300 times the human exposure at the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg / day , based on AUC .
A maternally toxic dose ( 250 mg / kg / day ) in rats ( 707 times the clinical dose ) , was associated with reduced fetal viability , and a higher incidence of a visceral malformation ( membranous ventricular septal defect ) .
In the pre - and post - natal development study in pregnant rats , ertugliflozin was administered to the dams from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 ( weaning ) .
Decreased post - natal growth ( weight gain ) was observed at maternal doses ≥ 100 mg / kg / day ( greater than or equal to 331 times the human exposure at the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg / day , based on AUC ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of STEGLATRO in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Ertugliflozin is present in the milk of lactating rats ( see Data ) .
Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when lactational exposure may occur , there may be risk to the developing human kidney .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant , advise women that the use of STEGLATRO is not recommended while breastfeeding .
Data The lacteal excretion of radiolabeled ertugliflozin in lactating rats was evaluated 10 to 12 days after parturition .
Ertugliflozin derived radioactivity exposure in milk and plasma were similar , with a milk / plasma ratio of 1 . 07 , based on AUC .
Juvenile rats directly exposed to STEGLATRO during a developmental period corresponding to human kidney maturation were associated with a risk to the developing kidney ( persistent increased organ weight , renal mineralization , and renal pelvic and tubular dilatations ) .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of STEGLATRO in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No dosage adjustment of STEGLATRO is recommended based on age .
In STEGLATRO clinical trials , a total of 876 ( 25 . 7 % ) patients treated with STEGLATRO were 65 years and older , and 152 ( 4 . 5 % ) patients treated with STEGLATRO were 75 years and older .
Patients 65 years and older had a higher incidence of adverse reactions related to volume depletion compared to younger patients ; events were reported in 1 . 1 % , 2 . 2 % , and 2 . 6 % of patients treated with comparator , STEGLATRO 5 mg , and STEGLATRO 15 mg , respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In VERTIS CV , a total of 2780 ( 50 . 5 % ) patients treated with STEGLATRO were 65 years and older , and 595 ( 10 . 8 % ) patients treated with STEGLATRO were 75 years and older .
Safety and efficacy were generally similar for patients age 65 years and older compared to patients younger than 65 .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment A 26 - week placebo - controlled study of 313 patients with Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease ( eGFR ≥ 30 to less than 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) treated with STEGLATRO did not demonstrate improvement in glycemic control .
In the VERTIS CV study , there were 1370 patients ( 25 % ) with an eGFR ≥ 90 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , 2929 patients ( 53 % ) with an eGFR of ≥ 60 to less than 90 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , 879 patients ( 16 % ) with an eGFR of ≥ 45 to less than 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , and 299 patients ( 5 % ) with eGFR of 30 to < 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 treated with STEGLATRO .
Similar effects on glycemic control at Week 18 were observed in patients treated with STEGLATRO in each eGFR subgroup and also in the overall patient population .
STEGLATRO is contraindicated in patients on dialysis [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with eGFR ≥ 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of STEGLATRO is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment .
Ertugliflozin has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended for use in this patient population [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of an overdose with STEGLATRO , contact the Poison Control Center .
Employ the usual supportive measures as dictated by the patient ' s clinical status .
Removal of ertugliflozin by hemodialysis has not been studied .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation .
Ertugliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2 .
By inhibiting SGLT2 , ertugliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose , and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Urinary Glucose Excretion and Urinary Volume Dose - dependent increases in the amount of glucose excreted in urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following single - and multiple - dose administration of ertugliflozin .
Dose - response modeling indicates that ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg result in near maximal urinary glucose excretion ( UGE ) .
Enhanced UGE is maintained after multiple - dose administration .
UGE with ertugliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of STEGLATRO on QTc interval was evaluated in a Phase 1 randomized , placebo - and positive - controlled 3 - period crossover study in 42 healthy subjects .
At 6 . 7 times the therapeutic exposures with maximum recommended dose , STEGLATRO does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin are similar in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 398 ng ∙ hr / mL and 81 . 3 ng / mL , respectively , with 5 mg ertugliflozin once - daily treatment , and 1 , 193 ng ∙ hr / mL and 268 ng / mL , respectively , with 15 mg ertugliflozin once - daily treatment .
Steady - state is reached after 4 to 6 days of once - daily dosing with ertugliflozin .
Ertugliflozin does not exhibit time - dependent pharmacokinetics and accumulates in plasma up to 10 - 40 % following multiple dosing .
Absorption Following single - dose oral administration of 5 mg and 15 mg of ertugliflozin , peak plasma concentrations ( median Tmax ) of ertugliflozin occur at 1 hour postdose under fasted conditions .
Plasma Cmax and AUC of ertugliflozin increase in a dose - proportional manner following single doses from 0 . 5 mg ( 0 . 1 times the lowest recommended dose ) to 300 mg ( 20 times the highest recommended dose ) and following multiple doses from 1 mg ( 0 . 2 times the lowest recommended dose ) to 100 mg ( 6 . 7 times the highest recommended dose ) .
The absolute oral bioavailability of ertugliflozin following administration of a 15 mg dose is approximately 100 % .
Effect of Food Administration of STEGLATRO with a high - fat and high - calorie meal decreases ertugliflozin Cmax by 29 % and prolongs Tmax by 1 hour , but does not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state .
The observed effect of food on ertugliflozin pharmacokinetics is not considered clinically relevant , and ertugliflozin may be administered with or without food .
In Phase 3 clinical trials , STEGLATRO was administered without regard to meals .
Distribution The mean steady - state volume of distribution of ertugliflozin following an intravenous dose is 85 . 5 L . Plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin is 93 . 6 % and is independent of ertugliflozin plasma concentrations .
Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment .
The blood - to - plasma concentration ratio of ertugliflozin is 0 . 66 .
Elimination Metabolism Metabolism is the primary clearance mechanism for ertugliflozin .
The major metabolic pathway for ertugliflozin is UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 - mediated O - glucuronidation to two glucuronides that are pharmacologically inactive at clinically relevant concentrations .
CYP - mediated ( oxidative ) metabolism of ertugliflozin is minimal ( 12 % ) .
Excretion The mean systemic plasma clearance following an intravenous 100 µg dose was 11 . 2 L / hr .
The mean elimination half - life in type 2 diabetic patients with normal renal function was estimated to be 16 . 6 hours based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis .
Following administration of an oral [ 14 C ] - ertugliflozin solution to healthy subjects , approximately 40 . 9 % and 50 . 2 % of the drug - related radioactivity was eliminated in feces and urine , respectively .
Only 1 . 5 % of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged ertugliflozin in urine and 33 . 8 % as unchanged ertugliflozin in feces , which is likely due to biliary excretion of glucuronide metabolites and subsequent hydrolysis to parent .
Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment In a clinical pharmacology study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild , moderate , or severe renal impairment ( as determined by eGFR ) , following a single - dose administration of 15 mg STEGLATRO , the mean increases in AUC of ertugliflozin were 1 . 6 - , 1 . 7 - , and 1 . 6 - fold , respectively , for mild , moderate and severe renally impaired patients , compared to subjects with normal renal function .
These increases in ertugliflozin AUC are not considered clinically meaningful .
The 24 - hour urinary glucose excretion declined with increasing severity of renal impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
The plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin was unaffected in patients with renal impairment .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Moderate hepatic impairment ( based on the Child - Pugh classification ) did not result in an increase in exposure of ertugliflozin .
The AUC of ertugliflozin decreased by approximately 13 % , and Cmax decreased by approximately 21 % compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
This decrease in ertugliflozin exposure is not considered clinically meaningful .
There is no clinical experience in patients with Child - Pugh class C ( severe ) hepatic impairment .
The plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin was unaffected in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Effects of Age , Body Weight , Gender , and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis , age , body weight , gender , and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin .
Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In in vitro studies , ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit CYP450 isoenzymes ( CYPs ) 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2C8 , 2B6 , 2D6 , or 3A4 , and did not induce CYPs 1A2 , 2B6 , or 3A4 .
Ertugliflozin was not a time - dependent inhibitor of CYP3A in vitro .
Ertugliflozin did not inhibit UGT1A6 , 1A9 , or 2B7 in vitro and was a weak inhibitor ( IC50 > 39 µM ) of UGT1A1 and 1A4 .
Ertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit UGT1A1 , 1A4 , 1A6 , 1A9 , or 2B7 in vitro .
Overall , ertugliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs eliminated by these enzymes .
Ertugliflozin is a substrate of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) transporters and is not a substrate of organic anion transporters ( OAT1 , OAT3 ) , organic cation transporters ( OCT1 , OCT2 ) , or organic anion transporting polypeptides ( OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 ) .
Ertugliflozin or ertugliflozin glucuronides do not meaningfully inhibit P - gp , OCT2 , OAT1 , or OAT3 transporters , or transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 , at clinically relevant concentrations .
Overall , ertugliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered medications that are substrates of these transporters .
In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions No dose adjustment of STEGLATRO is recommended when coadministered with commonly prescribed medicinal products .
Ertugliflozin pharmacokinetics were similar with and without coadministration of metformin , glimepiride , sitagliptin , and simvastatin in healthy subjects ( see Figure 1 ) .
Coadministration of ertugliflozin with multiple doses of 600 mg once - daily rifampin ( an inducer of UGT and CYP enzymes ) resulted in approximately 39 % and 15 % mean reductions in ertugliflozin AUC and Cmax , respectively , relative to ertugliflozin administered alone .
These changes in exposure are not considered clinically relevant .
Ertugliflozin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin , glimepiride , sitagliptin , and simvastatin when coadministered in healthy subjects ( see Figure 2 ) .
Physiologically - based PK ( PBPK ) modeling suggests that coadministration of mefenamic acid ( UGT inhibitor ) may increase the AUC and Cmax of ertugliflozin by 1 . 51 - and 1 . 19 - fold , respectively .
These predicted changes in exposure are not considered clinically relevant .
Figure 1 : Effects of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Ertugliflozin [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 2 : Effects of Ertugliflozin on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity was evaluated in CD - 1 mice and Sprague - Dawley rats .
In the mouse study , ertugliflozin was administered by oral gavage at doses of 5 , 15 , and 40 mg / kg / day for up to 97 weeks in males and 102 weeks in females .
There were no ertugliflozin - related neoplastic findings at doses up to 40 mg / kg / day ( approximately 50 times human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [ MRHD ] of 15 mg / day based on AUC ) .
In the rat study , ertugliflozin was administered by oral gavage at doses of 1 . 5 , 5 , and 15 mg / kg / day for up to 92 weeks in females and 104 weeks in males .
Ertugliflozin - related neoplastic findings included an increased incidence of adrenal medullary pheochromocytoma ( PCC ) in male rats at 15 mg / kg / day .
Although the molecular mechanism remains unknown , this finding may be related to carbohydrate malabsorption leading to altered calcium homeostasis , which has been associated with PCC development in rats and has unclear relevancy to human risk .
The no - observed - effect level ( NOEL ) for neoplasia was 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 16 times human exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg / day , based on AUC ) .
Mutagenesis Ertugliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the microbial reverse mutation , in vitro cytogenetic ( human lymphocytes ) , and in vivo rat micronucleus assays .
Impairment of Fertility In the rat fertility and embryonic development study , male and female rats were administered ertugliflozin at 5 , 25 , and 250 mg / kg / day .
No effects on fertility were observed at 250 mg / kg / day ( approximately 480 and 570 times male and female human exposures , respectively , at the MRHD of 15 mg / day based on AUC comparison ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Glycemic Control Trials in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus STEGLATRO has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin , sitagliptin , a sulfonylurea , insulin ( with or without metformin ) , metformin plus sitagliptin , metformin plus a sulfonylurea and compared to a sulfonylurea ( glimepiride ) .
STEGLATRO has also been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate renal impairment .
In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment with STEGLATRO reduced hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) compared to placebo .
Reduction in HbA1c was generally similar across subgroups defined by age , sex , race , geographic region , baseline body mass index ( BMI ) , and duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Monotherapy A total of 461 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled ( HbA1c between 7 % and 10 . 5 % ) on diet and exercise participated in a randomized , double - blind , multi - center , 26 - week , placebo - controlled study ( NCT01958671 ) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of STEGLATRO monotherapy .
These patients , who were either treatment naïve or not receiving any background antihyperglycemic treatment ≥ 8 weeks , entered a 2 - week , single - blind , placebo run - in period and were randomized to placebo , STEGLATRO 5 mg , or STEGLATRO 15 mg , administered once daily .
At Week 26 , treatment with STEGLATRO at 5 mg or 15 mg daily provided statistically significant reductions in HbA1c compared to placebo .
STEGLATRO also resulted in a greater proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c < 7 % compared with placebo ( see Table 4 and Figure 3 ) .

Patients were randomized to one of five treatment arms : STEGLATRO 5 mg , STEGLATRO 15 mg , sitagliptin 100 mg , STEGLATRO 5 mg + sitagliptin 100 mg , or STEGLATRO 15 mg + sitagliptin 100 mg .
At Week 26 , STEGLATRO 5 mg or 15 mg + sitagliptin 100 mg provided statistically significantly greater reductions in HbA1c compared to STEGLATRO ( 5 mg or 15 mg ) alone or sitagliptin 100 mg alone .
The mean change from baseline in HbA1c was - 1 . 4 % for STEGLATRO 5 mg or 15 mg + sitagliptin 100 mg versus - 1 . 0 % , for STEGLATRO 5 mg , STEGLATRO 15 mg , or sitagliptin 100 mg , respectively .
More patients receiving STEGLATRO 5 mg or 15 mg + sitagliptin 100 mg achieved an HbA1c < 7 % ( 53 . 3 % and 50 . 9 % , for STEGLATRO 5 mg or 15 mg , respectively , + sitagliptin 100 mg ) compared to the individual components ( 29 . 3 % , 33 . 7 % , and 38 . 5 % for STEGLATRO 5 mg , STEGLATRO 15 mg , or sitagliptin 100 mg , respectively ) .
Add - on Combination Therapy with Metformin and Sitagliptin A total of 463 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled ( HbA1c between 7 % and 10 . 5 % ) on metformin ( ≥ 1 , 500 mg / day for ≥ 8 weeks ) and sitagliptin 100 mg once daily participated in a randomized , double - blind , multi - center , 26 - week , placebo - controlled study ( NCT02036515 ) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of STEGLATRO .
Patients entered a 2 - week , single - blind , placebo run - in period and were randomized to placebo , STEGLATRO 5 mg , or STEGLATRO 15 mg .
At Week 26 , treatment with STEGLATRO at 5 mg or 15 mg daily provided statistically significant reductions in HbA1c .
STEGLATRO also resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c < 7 % compared to placebo ( see Table 7 ) .

Use in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Moderate Renal Impairment 26 - Week Placebo - Controlled Study The efficacy of STEGLATRO was assessed in a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study ( NCT01986855 ) of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate renal impairment ( 468 patients with eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
In this study , 202 patients exposed to STEGLATRO ( 5 mg or 15 mg ) had an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 and 111 patients exposed to STEGLATRO ( 5 mg or 15 mg ) had an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes for the study population was approximately 14 years , and the majority of patients were receiving background insulin ( 55 . 9 % ) and / or sulfonylurea ( 40 . 3 % ) therapy .
Approximately 50 % had a history of cardiovascular disease or heart failure .

14 . 2 Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Established Cardiovascular Disease The effect of STEGLATRO on cardiovascular risk in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was evaluated in the VERTIS CV study ( NCT01986881 ) , a multicenter , multi - national , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , event - driven trial .
The study compared the risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) between STEGLATRO and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease .
A total of 8246 patients were randomized ( placebo N = 2747 , STEGLATRO 5 mg N = 2752 , STEGLATRO 15 mg N = 2747 ) and followed for a median of 3 years .
Approximately 88 % of the study population was Caucasian , 6 % Asian , and 3 % Black .
The mean age was 64 years and approximately 70 % were male .
All patients in the study had inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline ( HbA1c greater than or equal to 7 % ) .
The mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 13 years , the mean HbA1c at baseline was 8 . 2 % and the mean eGFR was 76 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
At baseline , patients were treated with one ( 32 % ) or more ( 67 % ) antidiabetic medications including biguanides ( metformin ) ( 76 % ) , insulin ( 47 % ) , sulfonylureas ( 41 % ) DPP - 4 inhibitors ( 11 % ) and GLP - 1 receptor agonists ( 3 % ) .
Almost all patients ( 99 % ) had established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at baseline including : a documented history of coronary artery disease ( 76 % ) , cerebrovascular disease ( 23 % ) or peripheral artery disease ( 19 % ) .
Approximately 24 % patients had a history of heart failure ( HF ) .
At baseline , the mean systolic blood pressure was 133 mmHg , the mean diastolic blood pressure was 77 mmHg , the mean LDL was 89 mg / dL , and the mean HDL was 44 mg / dL .
At baseline , approximately 81 % of patients were treated with renin angiotensin system inhibitors , 69 % with beta - blockers , 43 % with diuretics , 82 % with statins , 4 % with ezetimibe , and 89 % with antiplatelet agents .
The primary endpoint in VERTIS CV was the time to first occurrence of MACE .
A major adverse cardiovascular event was defined as occurrence of either a cardiovascular death or a nonfatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) or a nonfatal stroke .
The statistical analysis plan pre - specified that the 5 and 15 mg doses would be combined for the analysis .
A Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non - inferiority against the pre - specified risk margin of 1 . 3 for the hazard ratio of MACE .
Type - 1 error was controlled across multiple tests using a hierarchical testing strategy .
The incidence rate of MACE was similar between the STEGLATRO - treated and placebo - treated patients .
The estimated hazard ratio of MACE associated with STEGLATRO relative to placebo was 0 . 97 with 95 . 6 % confidence interval ( 0 . 85 , 1 . 11 ) .
The upper bound of this confidence interval excluded a risk larger than 1 . 3 ( Table 10 ) .
Results for the individual 5 mg and 15 mg doses were consistent with results for the combined dose group .

[ 2 ] MACE was evaluated in subjects who took at least one dose of study medication and , for subjects who discontinued study medication prior to the end of the study , censored events that occurred more than 365 days after the last dose of study medication .
Other endpoints were evaluated using all randomized subjects and events that occurred any time after the first dose of study medication until the last contact date .
The total number of first events was analyzed for each endpoint .
[ 3 ] HR and CI are based on Cox proportional hazards regression model , stratified by cohorts .
For MACE a 95 . 6 % CI is presented , for other endpoints a 95 % CI is presented .

uspi - mk8835 - t - 2210r007 Medication Guide STEGLATRO ® ( steh - GLA - troh ) ( ertugliflozin ) tablets , for oral use This Medication Guide has been approved by the U . S . Food and Drug Administration .
Revised : 10 / 2022 Read this Medication Guide carefully before you start taking STEGLATRO and each time you get a refill .
There may be new information .
This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment .
What is the most important information I should know about STEGLATRO ?
STEGLATRO may cause serious side effects , including : • Ketoacidosis ( increased ketones in your blood or urine ) .
Ketoacidosis has happened in people who have type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes during treatment with STEGLATRO .
Ketoacidosis has also happened in people with diabetes who were sick or who had surgery during treatment with STEGLATRO .
Ketoacidosis is a serious condition , which may need to be treated in a hospital .
Ketoacidosis may lead to death .
Ketoacidosis can happen even if your blood sugar is less than 250 mg / dL .
Stop taking STEGLATRO and call your doctor right away if you get any of the following symptoms : • nausea • vomiting • stomach - area ( abdominal ) pain • tiredness • trouble breathing If you get any of these symptoms during treatment with STEGLATRO , if possible check for ketones in your urine , even if your blood sugar is less than 250 mg / dL .
• Amputations .
STEGLATRO may increase your risk of lower limb amputations .
You may be at a higher risk of lower limb amputation if you : • have a history of amputation • have had blocked or narrowed blood vessels , usually in your leg • have damage to the nerves ( neuropathy ) in your leg • have had diabetic foot ulcers or sores Call your doctor right away if you have new pain or tenderness , any sores , ulcers , or infections in your leg or foot .
Your doctor may decide to stop your STEGLATRO for a while if you have any of these signs or symptoms .
Talk to your doctor about proper foot care .
• Dehydration .
STEGLATRO can cause some people to become dehydrated ( the loss of body water and salt ) .
Dehydration may cause you to feel dizzy , faint , lightheaded , or weak , especially when you stand up ( orthostatic hypotension ) .
There have been reports of sudden worsening of kidney function in people who are taking STEGLATRO .
You may be at risk of dehydration if you : • have low blood pressure • take medicines to lower your blood pressure , including water pills ( diuretics ) • have kidney problems • are on a low sodium ( salt ) diet • are 65 years of age or older Talk to your doctor about what you can do to prevent dehydration including how much fluid you should drink on a daily basis .
• Vaginal yeast infection .
Women who take STEGLATRO may get vaginal yeast infections .
Symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection include : • vaginal odor • white or yellowish vaginal discharge ( discharge may be lumpy or look like cottage cheese ) • vaginal itching • Yeast infection of the penis ( balanitis or balanoposthitis ) .
Men who take STEGLATRO may get a yeast infection of the skin around the penis .
Certain men who are not circumcised may have swelling of the penis that makes it difficult to pull back the skin around the tip of your penis .
Other symptoms of yeast infection of the penis include : • redness , itching , or swelling of the penis • foul smelling discharge from the penis • rash of the penis • pain in the skin around your penis Talk to your doctor about what to do if you get symptoms of a yeast infection of the vagina or penis .
Your doctor may suggest you use an over - the - counter antifungal medicine .
Talk to your doctor right away if you use an over - the - counter antifungal medicine and your symptoms do not go away .
What is STEGLATRO ?
• STEGLATRO is a prescription medicine used in adults with type 2 diabetes to improve blood sugar ( glucose ) control along with diet and exercise .
