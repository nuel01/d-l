Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants ( 5 . 6 ) .
• • Long - Term Suppression of Growth : Monitor height and weight at appropriate intervals in pediatric patients ( 5 . 7 ) .
5 . 1 Potential for Abuse and Dependence CNS stimulants , including methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets , other methylphenidate - containing products , and amphetamines , have a high potential for abuse and dependence .
Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing , and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy [ see Boxed Warning , Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 . 2 , 9 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 2 Serious Cardiovascular Reactions Sudden death , stroke , and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses .
Sudden death has been reported in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD .
Avoid use in patients with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities , cardiomyopathy , serious heart rhythm abnormalities , coronary artery disease , and other serious heart problems .
Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain , unexplained syncope , or arrhythmias during methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets treatment .
5 . 3 Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure ( mean increase approximately 2 to 4 mmHg ) and heart rate ( mean increase approximately 3 to 6 beats per minute ) .
Individuals may have larger increases .
Monitor all patients for hypertension and tachycardia .
5 . 4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation of Preexisting Psychosis CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a preexisting psychotic disorder .
Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed mood episode in patients .
Prior to initiating treatment , screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode ( e . g . , comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide , bipolar disorder , or depression ) .
New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants , at recommended doses , may cause psychotic or manic symptoms ( e . g . , hallucinations , delusional thinking , or mania ) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania .
If such symptoms occur , consider discontinuing methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets .
In a pooled analysis of multiple short - term , placebo - controlled studies of CNS stimulants , psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0 . 1 % of CNS stimulant - treated patients , compared to 0 in placebo - treated patients .
5 . 5 Priapism Prolonged and painful erections , sometimes requiring surgical intervention , have been reported with methylphenidate products in both pediatric and adult patients .
Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug , often subsequent to an increase in dose .
Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal ( drug holidays or during discontinuation ) .
Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention .
5 . 6 Peripheral Vasculopathy , Including Raynaud ’ s Phenomenon CNS stimulants , including methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets , used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy , including Raynaud ’ s phenomenon .
Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild ; however , very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and / or soft tissue breakdown .
Effects of peripheral vasculopathy , including Raynaud ’ s phenomenon , were observed in postmarketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment .
Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug .
Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants .
Further clinical evaluation ( e . g . , rheumatology referral ) may be appropriate for certain patients .
5 . 7 Long - Term Suppression of Growth CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients .
Careful follow - up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non - medication treatment groups over 14 months , as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate - treated and non - medication treated patients over 36 months ( to the ages of 10 to 13 years ) , suggests that consistently medicated pediatric patients ( i . e . , treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year ) have a temporary slowing in growth rate ( on average , a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2 . 7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years ) , without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development .
Closely monitor growth ( weight and height ) in pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants , including methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets .
Patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted .

Risk Summary Published studies and postmarketing reports on methylphenidate use during pregnancy have not identified a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
There may be risks to the fetus associated with the use of CNS stimulants use during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
No effects on morphological development were observed in embryo - fetal development studies with oral administration of methylphenidate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 10 and 15 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 60 mg / day given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis .
However , spina bifida was observed in rabbits at a dose 52 times the MRHD given to adolescents .
A decrease in pup body weight was observed in a pre - and post - natal development study with oral administration of methylphenidate to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses 6 times the MRHD given to adolescents ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions CNS stimulants , such as methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets , can cause vasoconstriction and thereby decrease placental perfusion .
No fetal and / or neonatal adverse reactions have been reported with the use of therapeutic doses of methylphenidate during pregnancy ; however , premature delivery and low birth weight infants have been reported in amphetamine - dependent mothers .
Data Animal Data In embryo - fetal development studies conducted in rats and rabbits , methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 75 and 200 mg / kg / day , respectively , during the period of organogenesis .
Malformations ( increased incidence of fetal spina bifida ) were observed in rabbits at the highest dose , which is approximately 52 times the MRHD of 60 mg / day given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis .
The no effect level for embryo - fetal development in rabbits was 60 mg / kg / day ( 15 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis ) .
There was no evidence of morphological development effects in rats , although increased incidences of fetal skeletal variations were seen at the highest dose level ( 10 times the MRHD of 60 mg / day given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis ) , which was also maternally toxic .
The no effect level for embryo - fetal development in rats was 25 mg / kg / day ( 3 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
When methylphenidate was administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses of up to 45 mg / kg / day , offspring body weight gain was decreased at the highest dose ( 6 times the MRHD of 60 mg / day given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis ) , but no other effects on postnatal development were observed .
The no effect level for pre - and postnatal development in rats was 15 mg / kg / day ( ~ 2 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published literature , based on milk sampling from seven mothers reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk , which resulted in infant doses of 0 . 16 % to 0 . 7 % of the maternal weight - adjusted dosage and a milk / plasma ratio ranging between 1 . 1 and 2 . 7 .
There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production .
Long - term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from stimulant exposure are unknown .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions , such as agitation , insomnia , anorexia , and reduced weight gain .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets for the treatment of ADHD have been established in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years .
The safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets in pediatric patients less than 6 years have not been established .
The long - term efficacy of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets in pediatric patients has not been established .
Long - Term Suppression of Growth Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants , including methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets .
Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Rats treated with methylphenidate early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation demonstrated a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity in adulthood .
A deficit in acquisition of a specific learning task was observed in females only .
The doses at which these findings were observed are at least 4 times the MRHD of 60 mg / day given to children on a mg / m2 basis .
In a study conducted in young rats , methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg / kg / day for 9 weeks , starting early in the postnatal period ( postnatal Day 7 ) and continuing through sexual maturity ( postnatal Week 10 ) .
When these animals were tested as adults ( postnatal Weeks 13 to 14 ) , decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in males and females previously treated with 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 4 times the MRHD of 60 mg / day given to children on a mg / m2 basis ) or greater , and a deficit in the acquisition of a specific learning task was seen in females exposed to the highest dose ( 8 times the MRHD given to children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
The no effect level for juvenile neurobehavioral development in rats was 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 5 times the MRHD given to children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
The clinical significance of the long - term behavioral effects observed in rats is unknown .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets have not been studied in the geriatric population .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets contain methylphenidate hydrochloride , a Schedule II controlled substance .

11 DESCRIPTION Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets , USP contain methylphenidate hydrochloride , a CNS stimulant .
It is available as tablets of 5 mg , 10 mg , and 20 mg strength for oral administration .
Methylphenidate hydrochloride is methyl α - phenyl - 2 - piperidineacetate hydrochloride , and its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Methylphenidate hydrochloride USP is a white to off - white fine crystalline powder .
Its solutions are acid to litmus .
It is freely soluble in water and in methanol , soluble in alcohol , and slightly soluble in chloroform and in acetone .
Its molecular weight is 269 . 77 g / mol .
Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets contain the following inactive ingredients : Hypromellose , lactose monohydrate , microcrystalline cellulose , polyethylene glycol 8000 , stearic acid , ferric oxide yellow ( 5 - mg and 20 - mg tablets ) , and FD & C Blue # 2 ( 10 - mg tablets ) .
FDA approved dissolution test specifications differ from USP .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Methylphenidate hydrochloride is a CNS stimulant .
The mode of therapeutic action in ADHD and narcolepsy is not known .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d - and l - threo enantiomers .
The d - threo enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l - threo enantiomer .
Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space .
Cardiac Electrophysiology A formal QT study has not been conducted in patients taking methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets .
The effect of dexmethylphenidate , the pharmacologically active d - enantiomer of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets , on the QT interval was evaluated in a double - blind , placebo - and open - label active ( moxifloxacin ) - controlled study following single doses of dexmethlyphenidate XR 40 mg ( maximum recommended adult total daily dosage ) in 75 healthy volunteers .
Electrocardiograms were collected up to 12 hours postdose .
Frederica ’ s method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval ( QTcF ) .
The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was less than 5 ms , and the upper limit of the 90 % confidence interval was below 10 ms for all time - matched comparisons versus placebo .
This was below the threshold of clinical concern and there was no evident exposure response relationship .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Methylphenidate hydrochloride in the methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release tablets are more slowly but as extensively absorbed as in the regular tablets .
Relative bioavailability of the methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release tablets compared to the methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets , measured by the urinary excretion of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets major metabolite ( α - phenyl - 2 - piperidine acetic acid ) was 105 % ( 49 % to 168 % ) in children and 101 % ( 85 % to 152 % ) in adults .
The time to peak rate in children was 1 . 9 hours ( 0 . 3 to 4 . 4 hours ) for the methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets and 4 . 7 hours ( 1 . 3 to 8 . 2 hours ) for the methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
An average of 67 % of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release tablets dose was excreted in children as compared to 86 % in adults .
Effect of Food After a high - fat meal , both area under the curve ( AUC ) ( by 25 % ) and Cmax ( by 27 % ) are higher .
Time to Cmax ( Tmax ) is faster after a high - fat meal ( median Tmax : 2 . 5 hours ) as compared to without food ( median Tmax : 3 hours ) .
Distribution Binding to plasma proteins is low ( 10 % to 33 % ) .
The volume of distribution was 2 . 65 ± 1 . 11 L / kg for d - methylphenidate and 1 . 80 ± 0 . 91 L / kg for l - methylphenidate .
Elimination The systemic clearance is 0 . 40 ± 0 . 12 L / h / kg for d - methylphenidate and 0 . 73 ± 0 . 28 L / h / kg for l - methylphenidate .
Metabolism Methylphenidate is metabolized primarily by de - esterification to alpha - phenyl - piperidine acetic acid ( ritalinic acid ) , which has little or no pharmacologic activity .
Excretion After oral administration , 78 % to 97 % of the dose is excreted in the urine and 1 % to 3 % in feces in the form of metabolites within 48 to 96 hours .
Most of the dose is excreted in the urine as alpha - phenyl - 2 - piperidine acetic acid ( 60 % to 86 % ) .
The cumulative urinary excretion of alpha phenyl - 2 - piperidine acetic acid are not significantly different for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
Studies in Specific Populations Male and Female Patients In a clinical study involving adult subjects who received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release tablets , plasma concentrations of methylphenidate hydrochloride ’ s major metabolite appeared to be greater in females than in males .
No gender differences were observed for methylphenidate hydrochloride plasma concentration in the same subjects .
Racial or Ethnic Groups There is insufficient experience with the use of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets to detect ethnic variations in pharmacokinetics .
Patients with Renal Impairment Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets have not been studied in renally - impaired patients .
Renal impairment is expected to have minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate since less than 1 % of a radiolabeled dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged compound , and the major metabolite ( ritalinic acid ) , has little or no pharmacologic activity .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment .
Hepatic impairment is expected to have minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate since it is metabolized primarily to ritalinic acid by nonmicrosomal hydrolytic esterases that are widely distributed throughout the body .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice , methylphenidate caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas , and in males only , an increase in hepatoblastomas at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg / kg / day .
This dose is approximately 2 times the MRHD of 60 mg / day given to children on mg / m2 basis .
Hepatoblastoma is a relatively rare rodent malignant tumor type .
There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors .
The mouse strain used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors and the significance of these results to humans is unknown .
Methylphenidate did not cause any increase in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats ; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 4 times the MRHD ( children ) on a mg / m2 basis .
In a 24 - week carcinogenicity study in the transgenic mouse strain p53 + / - , which is sensitive to genotoxic carcinogens , there was no evidence of carcinogenicity .
Male and female mice were fed diets containing the same concentration of methylphenidate as in the lifetime carcinogenicity study ; the high - dose groups were exposed to 60 to 74 mg / kg / day of methylphenidate .
Mutagenesis Methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay , in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay , or in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay using human lymphocytes .
Sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations were increased , indicative of a weak clastogenic response , in an in vitro assay in cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary cells .
Methylphenidate was negative in vivo in males and females in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility No human data on the effect of methylphenidate on fertility are available .
