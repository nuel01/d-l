DESCRIPTION Amiloride HCl , an antikaliuretic - diuretic agent , is a pyrazine - carbonyl - guanidine that is unrelated chemically to other known antikaliuretic or diuretic agents .
It is the salt of a moderately strong base ( pKa 8 . 7 ) .
It is designated chemically as 3 , 5 - diamino - 6 - chloro - N - ( diaminomethylene ) pyrazinecarboxamide monohydrochloride , dihydrate and has a molecular weight of 302 . 12 .
Its empirical formula is C 6H8CIN7O • HCl • 2H2O and its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each tablet for oral administration contains 5 mg of Amiloride HCI , calculated on the anhydrous basis .
Each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients : colloidal silicon dioxide , croscarmellose sodium , D & C yellow # 10 lake , dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate , FD & C yellow # 6 lake , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose and silicon dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Amiloride HCl is a potassium - conserving ( antikaliuretic ) drug that possesses weak ( compared with thiazide diuretics ) natriuretic , diuretic , and antihypertensive activity .
These effects have been partially additive to the effects of thiazide diuretics in some clinical studies .
When administered with a thiazide or loop diuretic , amiloride has been shown to decrease the enhanced urinary excretion of magnesium which occurs when a thiazide or loop diuretic is used alone .
Amiloride has potassium - conserving activity in patients receiving kaliureticdiuretic agents .
Amiloride HCl is not an aldosterone antagonist and its effects are seen even in the absence of aldosterone .
Amiloride exerts its potassium sparing effect through the inhibition of sodium reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubule , cortical collecting tubule and collecting duct ; this decreases the net negative potential of the tubular lumen and reduces both potassium and hydrogen secretion and their subsequent excretion .
This mechanism accounts in large part for the potassium sparing action of amiloride .
Amiloride usually begins to act within 2 hours after an oral dose .
Its effect on electrolyte excretion reaches a peak between 6 and 10 hours and lasts about 24 hours .
Peak plasma levels are obtained in 3 to 4 hours and the plasma half - life varies from 6 to 9 hours .
Effects on electrolytes increase with single doses of amiloride HCl up to approximately 15 mg .
Amiloride HCl is not metabolized by the liver but is excreted unchanged by the kidneys .
About 50 percent of a 20 mg dose of amiloride HCl is excreted in the urine and 40 percent in the stool within 72 hours .
Amiloride has little effect on glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow .
Because amiloride HCl is not metabolized by the liver , drug accumulation is not anticipated in patients with hepatic dysfunction , but accumulation can occur if the hepatorenal syndrome develops .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amiloride HCl is indicated as adjunctive treatment with thiazide diuretics or other kaliureticdiuretic agents in congestive heart failure or hypertension to : • help restore normal serum potassium levels in patients who develop hypokalemia on the kaliuretic diuretic .
• prevent development of hypokalemia in patients who would be exposed to particular risk if hypokalemia were to develop , e . g . , digitalized patients or patients with significant cardiac arrhythmias .
The use of potassium - conserving agents is often unnecessary in patients receiving diuretics for uncomplicated essential hypertension when such patients have a normal diet .
Amiloride HCl has little additive diuretic or antihypertensive effect when added to a thiazide diuretic .
Amiloride HCl should rarely be used alone .
It has weak ( compared with thiazides ) diuretic and antihypertensive effects .
Used as single agents , potassium sparing diuretics , including amiloride HCl , result in an increased risk of hyperkalemia ( approximately 10 % with amiloride ) .
Amiloride HCl should be used alone only when persistent hypokalemia has been documented and only with careful titration of the dose and close monitoring of serum electrolytes .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Hyperkalemia Amiloride HCl should not be used in the presence of elevated serum potassium levels ( greater than 5 . 5 mEq per liter ) .
Antikaliuretic Therapy or Potassium Supplementation Amiloride HCl should not be given to patients receiving other potassium - conserving agents , such as spironolactone or triamterene .
Potassium supplementation in the form of medication , potassium - containing salt substitutes or a potassium - rich diet should not be used with amiloride HCl except in severe and / or refractory cases of hypokalemia .
Such concomitant therapy can be associated with rapid increases in serum potassium levels .
If potassium supplementation is used , careful monitoring of the serum potassium level is necessary .
Impaired Renal Function Anuria , acute or chronic renal insufficiency , and evidence of diabetic nephropathy are contraindications to the use of amiloride HCl .
Patients with evidence of renal functional impairment ( blood urea nitrogen [ BUN ] levels over 30 mg per 100 mL or serum creatinine levels over 1 . 5 mg per 100 mL ) or diabetes mellitus should not receive the drug without careful , frequent and continuing monitoring of serum electrolytes , creatinine , and BUN levels .
Potassium retention associated with the use of an antikaliuretic agent is accentuated in the presence of renal impairment and may result in the rapid development of hyperkalemia .
Hypersensitivity Amiloride HCl is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product .
WARNINGS Hyperkalemia Like other potassium - conserving agents , amiloride may cause hyperkalemia ( serum potassium levels greater than 5 . 5 mEq per liter ) which , if uncorrected , is potentially fatal .
Hyperkalemia occurs commonly ( about 10 % ) when amiloride is used without a kaliuretic diuretic .
This incidence is greater in patients with renal impairment , diabetes mellitus ( with or without recognized renal insufficiency ) , and in the elderly .
When amiloride is used concomitantly with a thiazide diuretic in patients without these complications , the risk of hyperkalemia is reduced to about 1 - 2 % .
It is thus essential to monitor serum potassium levels carefully in any patient receiving amiloride , particularly when it is first introduced , at the time of diuretic dosage adjustments , and during any illness that could affect renal function .
The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased when potassium - conserving agents , including amiloride HCl , are administered concomitantly with an angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor , an angiotensin II receptor antagonist , cyclosporine or tacrolimus .
( See PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions . )
Warning signs or symptoms of hyperkalemia include paresthesias , muscular weakness , fatigue , flaccid paralysis of the extremities , bradycardia , shock , and ECG abnormalities .
Monitoring of the serum potassium level is essential because mild hyperkalemia is not usually associated with an abnormal ECG .
When abnormal , the ECG in hyperkalemia is characterized primarily by tall , peaked T waves or elevations from previous tracings .
There may also be lowering of the R wave and increased depth of the S wave , widening and even disappearance of the P wave , progressive widening of the QRS complex , prolongation of the PR interval , and ST depression .
Treatment of hyperkalemia : If hyperkalemia occurs in patients taking amiloride HCl , the drug should be discontinued immediately .
If the serum potassium level exceeds 6 . 5 mEq per liter , active measures should be taken to reduce it .
Such measures include the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate solution or oral or parenteral glucose with a rapid - acting insulin preparation .
If needed , a cation exchange resin such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate may be given orally or by enema .
Patients with persistent hyperkalemia may require dialysis .
Diabetes Mellitus In diabetic patients , hyperkalemia has been reported with the use of all potassium - conserving diuretics , including amiloride HCl , even in patients without evidence of diabetic nephropathy .
Therefore , amiloride HCl should be avoided , if possible , in diabetic patients and , if it is used , serum electrolytes and renal function must be monitored frequently .
Amiloride HCl should be discontinued at least 3 days before glucose tolerance testing .
Metabolic or Respiratory Acidosis Antikaliuretic therapy should be instituted only with caution in severely ill patients in whom respiratory or metabolic acidosis may occur , such as patients with cardiopulmonary disease or poorly controlled diabetes .
If amiloride HCl is given to these patients , frequent monitoring of acid - base balance is necessary .
Shifts in acid - base balance alter the ratio of extracellular / intracellular potassium , and the development of acidosis may be associated with rapid increases in serum potassium levels .
GENERAL PRECAUTIONS Electrolyte Imbalance and BUN Increases Hyponatremia and hypochloremia may occur when amiloride HCl is used with other diuretics and increases in BUN levels have been reported .
These increases usually have accompanied vigorous fluid elimination , especially when diuretic therapy was used in seriously ill patients , such as those who had hepatic cirrhosis with ascites and metabolic alkalosis , or those with resistant edema .
Therefore , when amiloride HCl is given with other diuretics to such patients , careful monitoring of serum electrolytes and BUN levels is important .
In patients with pre - existing severe liver disease , hepatic encephalopathy , manifested by tremors , confusion , and coma , and increased jaundice , have been reported in association with diuretics , including amiloride HCl .
Drug Interactions When amiloride HCl is administered concomitantly with an angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor , an angiotensin II receptor antagonist , cyclosporine or tacrolimus , the risk of hyperkalemia may be increased .
Therefore , if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia , they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium .
( See WARNINGS ) .
Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity .
Read circulars for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy .
In some patients , the administration of a non - steroidal anti - inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effects of loop , potassium - sparing and thiazide diuretics .
Therefore , when amiloride HCl and non - steroidal anti - inflammatory agents are used concomitantly , the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained .
Since indomethacin and potassium - sparing diuretics , including amiloride HCl , may each be associated with increased serum potassium levels , the potential effects on potassium kinetics and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently .
Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when amiloride HCl was administered for 92 weeks to mice at doses up to 10 mg / kg / day ( 25 times the maximum daily human dose ) .
Amiloride HCl has also been administered for 104 weeks to male and female rats at doses up to 6 and 8 mg / kg / day ( 15 and 20 times the maximum daily dose for humans , respectively ) and showed no evidence of carcinogenicity .
Amiloride HCl was devoid of mutagenic activity in various strains of Salmonella typhimurium with or without a mammalian liver microsomal activation system ( Ames test ) .
Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B . Teratogenicity studies with amiloride HCl in rabbits and mice given 20 and 25 times the maximum human dose , respectively , revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus , although studies showed that the drug crossed the placenta in modest amounts .
Reproduction studies in rats at 20 times the expected maximum daily dose for humans showed no evidence of impaired fertility .
At approximately 5 or more times the expected maximum daily dose for humans , some toxicity was seen in adult rats and rabbits and a decrease in rat pup growth and survival occurred .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown that amiloride is excreted in milk in concentrations higher than those found in blood , but it is not known whether amiloride is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from amiloride HCl , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of amiloride HCI did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
( See CONTRAINDICATIONS , Impaired Renal Function . )
ADVERSE REACTIONS Amiloride HCl is usually well tolerated and , except for hyperkalemia ( serum potassium levels greater than 5 . 5 mEq liter - see WARNINGS ) , significant adverse effects have been reported infrequently .
Minor adverse reactions were reported relatively frequently ( about 20 % ) but the relationship of many of the reports to amiloride HCl is uncertain and the overall frequency was similar in hydrochlorothiazide treated groups .
Nausea / anorexia , abdominal pain , flatulence , and mild skin rash have been reported and probably are related to amiloride .
Other adverse experiences that have been reported with amiloride are generally those known to be associated with diuresis , or with the underlying disease being treated .
The adverse reactions for amiloride HCl listed in the following table have been arranged into two groups : ( 1 ) incidence greater than one percent ; and ( 2 ) incidence one percent or less .
The incidence for group ( 1 ) was determined from clinical studies conducted in the United States ( 837 patients treated with amiloride HCl ) .
The adverse effects listed in group ( 2 ) include reports from the same clinical studies and voluntary reports since marketing .
The probability of a causal relationship exists between amiloride HCl and these adverse reactions , some of which have been reported only rarely .
* Reactions occurring in 3 % to 8 % of patients treated with amiloride HCl .
( Those reactions occurring in less than 3 % of the patients are unmarked . )

However , in these rarely reported events , that possibility cannot be excluded .
Therefore , these observations are listed to serve as alerting information to physicians .
Activation of probable pre - existing peptic ulcer Aplastic anemia Neutropenia Abnormal liver function OVERDOSAGE No data are available in regard to overdosage in humans .
The oral LD 50 of amiloride HCl ( calculated as the base ) is 56 mg / kg in mice and 36 to 85 mg / kg in rats , depending on the strain .
It is not known whether the drug is dialyzable .
The most likely signs and symptoms to be expected with overdosage are dehydration and electrolyte imbalance .
These can be treated by established procedures .
Therapy with amiloride HCl should be discontinued and the patient observed closely .
There is no specific antidote . Emesis should be induced or gastric lavage performed . Treatment is symptomatic and supportive .
If hyperkalemia occurs , active measures should be taken to reduce the serum potassium levels .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Amiloride HCl should be administered with food .
Amiloride HCl , one 5 mg tablet daily , should be added to the usual antihypertensive or diuretic dosage of a kaliuretic diuretic .
The dosage may be increased to 10 mg per day , if necessary .
More than two 5 mg tablets of amiloride HCl daily usually are not needed , and there is little controlled experience with such doses .
If persistent hypokalemia is documented with 10 mg , the dose can be increased to 15 mg , then 20 mg , with careful monitoring of electrolytes .
In treating patients with congestive heart failure after an initial diuresis has been achieved , potassium loss may also decrease and the need for amiloride HCl should be re - evaluated .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary .
Maintenance therapy may be on an intermittent basis .
If it is necessary to use amiloride HCl alone ( see INDICATIONS ) , the starting dosage should be one 5 mg tablet daily .
This dosage may be increased to 10 mg per day , if necessary .
More than two 5 mg tablets usually are not needed , and there is little controlled experience with such doses .
If persistent hypokalemia is documented with 10 mg , the dose can be increased to 15 mg , then 20 mg , with careful monitoring of electrolytes .
