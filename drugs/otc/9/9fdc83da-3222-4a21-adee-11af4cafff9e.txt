FOR TOPICAL USE ONLY NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC USE DESCRIPTION Noritate ® ( metronidazole cream ) Cream , 1 % , contains metronidazole USP .
Chemically , metronidazole is 2 - methyl - 5 - nitro - 1 H - imidazole - 1 - ethanol .
The molecular formula for metronidazole is C6H9N3O3 .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Metronidazole has a molecular weight of 171 . 16 .
It is a white to pale yellow crystalline powder .
It is slightly soluble in alcohol and has a solubility in water of 10 mg / mL at 20 ° C . Metronidazole is a member of the imidazole class of antibacterial agents and is classified as an antiprotozoal and antibacterial agent .
Noritate is an emollient cream ; each gram contains 10 mg micronized metronidazole USP , in a base of glycerin USP , glyceryl monostearate NF , methylparaben NF , propylparaben NF , purified water USP , stearic acid NF and trolamine NF .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics : When a one gram dose of Noritate Cream , 1 % , was applied in a single application to the face of 16 healthy volunteers , low concentrations of metronidazole were detected in the plasma of 7 of the volunteers .
The mean ± SD Cmax of metronidazole was 27 . 6 ± 7 . 3 ng / mL , which is about 1 % of the value reported for a single 250 mg oral dose of metronidazole .
The time to maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) in the volunteers with detectable metronidazole was 8 - 12 hours after topical application .
Pharmacodynamics : The mechanisms by which metronidazole acts in reducing inflammatory lesions of rosacea are unknown .
Clinical Studies : Safety and efficacy of Noritate were evaluated in two randomized vehicle - controlled clinical studies for the treatment of rosacea , which excluded patients who had nodules , moderate or severe rhinophyma , dense telangiectases , plaque - like facial edema or ocular involvement and those who had a history of not responding to metronidazole therapy for rosacea .
Of the patients included in the efficacy database ( n = 416 ) , there were 142 men and 274 women .
Endpoint efficacy data comparisons for patients treated with daily Noritate or vehicle applications are listed below .

Erythema scores : 0 = none , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate and 3 = severe .
Safety Studies : Studies of contact sensitization ( n = 258 ) , phototoxicity ( n = 21 ) , and photocontact sensitization ( n = 29 ) of Noritate were conducted .
No evidence of sensitization or phototoxicity was seen in these studies .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Noritate is indicated for the topical treatment of inflammatory lesions and erythema of rosacea .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Noritate is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to metronidazole or to any other ingredient in this formulation .
PRECAUTIONS General : If a reaction suggesting local skin irritation occurs , patients should be directed to discontinue use of the medication .
Conjunctivitis associated with topical use of metronidazole on the face has been reported .
Contact with the eyes should be avoided .
Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole and should be used with care in patients with evidence of , or history of , blood dyscrasia .
Information for Patients : Patients using Noritate should receive the following information and instructions : • 1 .
This medication is to be used as directed .
• 2 .
It is for external use only .
• 3 .
Avoid contact with the eyes .
• 4 .
Cleanse affected area ( s ) before applying Noritate .
• 5 .
This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it is prescribed .
• 6 .
Patients should report any adverse reaction to their physician .
Drug Interactions : Oral metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of coumarin and warfarin resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time .
Drug interactions should be kept in mind when Noritate is prescribed for patients who are receiving anticoagulant treatment , although they are less likely to occur with topical metronidazole administration because of low absorption .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics . )
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Metronidazole has shown evidence of carcinogenic activity in a number of studies involving chronic , oral administration in mice and rats but not in studies involving hamsters .
In several long - term studies in mice , oral doses of approximately 225 mg / m2 / day or greater ( approximately 37 times the human topical dose on a mg / m2 basis ) were associated with an increase in pulmonary tumors and lymphomas .
Several long - term oral studies in the rat have shown statistically significant increases in mammary and hepatic tumors at doses > 885 mg / m2 / day ( 144 times the topical human dose ) .
Metronidazole has shown evidence of mutagenic activity in several in vitro bacterial assay systems .
In addition , a dose - related increase in the frequency of micronuclei was observed in mice after intraperitoneal injections .
An increase in chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes was reported in patients with Crohn ’ s disease who were treated with 200 to 1200 mg / day of metronidazole for 1 to 24 months .
However , in another study , no increase in chromosomal aberrations in circulating lymphocytes was observed in patients with Crohn ’ s disease treated with the drug for 8 months .
In one published study , using albino hairless mice , intraperitoneal administration of metronidazole at a dose of 45 mg / m2 / day ( approximately 7 times the human topical dose on a mg / m2 basis ) was associated with an increase in ultraviolet radiation - induced skin carcinogenesis .
Neither dermal carcinogenicity nor photocarcinogenicity studies have been performed with Noritate or any marketed metronidazole formulations .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects : There are no adequate and well - controlled studies with the use of Noritate in pregnant women .
Metronidazole crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation rapidly .
No fetotoxicity was observed after oral administration of metronidazole to rats or mice at 200 and 20 times , respectively , the expected clinical dose .
However , oral metronidazole has shown carcinogenic activity in rodents .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , Noritate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : After oral administration , metronidazole is secreted in breast milk in concentrations similar to those found in the plasma .
Even though blood levels taken after topical metronidazole application are significantly lower than those achieved after oral metronidazole , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother and the risk to the infant .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Safety data from 302 patients who used Noritate ( n = 200 ) or vehicle control ( n = 102 ) once daily in clinical trials and experienced an adverse event considered to be treatment related include : application site reaction ( Noritate 1 , vehicle 1 ) , condition aggravated ( Noritate 1 , vehicle 0 ) , paresthesia ( Noritate 0 , vehicle 1 ) , acne ( Noritate 1 , vehicle 0 ) , dry skin ( Noritate 0 , vehicle 2 ) .
The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity .
Two patients treated with Noritate once daily discontinued treatment because of adverse events : one for a severe flare of comedonal acne and one for rosacea aggravated .
Additional clinical adverse effects reported spontaneously since the drug was marketed are uncommon and include tingling or numbness of extremities , allergic reactions , skin and eye irritation , rash , headache , nausea and dry mouth .
