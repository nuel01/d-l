6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ALECENSA .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and lymphatic system disorders : hemolytic anemia .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Do not breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action , ALECENSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on ALECENSA use in pregnant women .
Administration of alectinib to pregnant rats and rabbits by oral gavage during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo - fetal toxicity and abortion at maternally toxic doses with exposures approximately 2 . 7 times those observed in humans treated with alectinib at 600 mg twice daily ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a preliminary rabbit embryo - fetal study , administration of alectinib by oral gavage during the period of organogenesis resulted in abortion or complete embryo - fetal mortality at a maternally toxic dose of 27 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 . 9 - fold the estimated area under the curve ( AUC0 - 24 h , ss ) in humans treated with alectinib 600 mg BID ) in three of six pregnant rabbits .
The remaining three pregnant rabbits in this group had few live fetuses , decreased fetal and placental weights , and retroesophageal subclavian artery .
In a rat preliminary embryo - fetal development study , administration of alectinib during organogenesis resulted in complete litter loss in all pregnant rats at 27 mg / kg / day ( approximately 4 . 5 - fold the estimated AUC0 - 24 h , ss in humans treated with alectinib 600 mg BID ) .
Doses greater than or equal to 9 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 . 7 - fold the estimated human AUC0 - 24 h , ss in humans treated with alectinib 600 mg BID ) , resulted in maternal toxicity as well as developmental toxicities including decreased fetal weight , dilated ureter , thymic cord , small ventricle and thin ventricle wall , and reduced number of sacral and caudal vertebrae .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of alectinib or its metabolites in human milk , the effects of alectinib on the breastfed infant , or its effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from alectinib , advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with ALECENSA and for 1 week after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females ALECENSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALECENSA and for 1 week after the final dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Males Based on genotoxicity findings , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALECENSA and for 3 months following the final dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ALECENSA in pediatric patients have not been established .
Animal Data Juvenile animal studies have not been conducted using alectinib .
In general toxicology studies , treatment of rats with doses of alectinib resulting in exposures greater than or equal to approximately 4 . 5 times those in humans treated with alectinib at 600 mg twice daily resulted in changes in the growing teeth and bones .
Findings in teeth included discoloration and changes in tooth size along with histopathological disarrangement of the ameloblast and odontoblast layers .
There were also decreases in the trabecular bone and increased osteoclast activity in the femur and sternum .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ALECENSA did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment .
The safety of ALECENSA in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min ) or end - stage renal disease has not been studied [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild ( Child - Pugh A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh B ) hepatic impairment .
Increased exposure of alectinib occurred in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) .
The recommended dose of ALECENSA in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) is 450 mg orally twice daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE No experience with overdose is available .
There is no specific antidote for overdose with ALECENSA .
Alectinib and its major active metabolite M4 are > 99 % bound to plasma proteins ; therefore , hemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in the treatment of overdose .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Alectinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets ALK and RET .
In nonclinical studies , alectinib inhibited ALK phosphorylation and ALK - mediated activation of the downstream signaling proteins STAT3 and AKT , and decreased tumor cell viability in multiple cell lines harboring ALK fusions , amplifications , or activating mutations .
The major active metabolite of alectinib , M4 , showed similar in vitro potency and activity .
Alectinib and M4 demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against multiple mutant forms of the ALK enzyme , including some mutations identified in NSCLC tumors in patients who have progressed on crizotinib .
In mouse models implanted with tumors carrying ALK fusions , administration of alectinib resulted in antitumor activity and prolonged survival , including in mouse models implanted intracranially with ALK - driven tumor cell lines .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The ability of alectinib to prolong the QT interval was assessed in 221 patients administered ALECENSA 600 mg twice daily in clinical studies .
ALECENSA did not prolong the QTc ( QT corrected for heart rate ) interval to any clinically relevant extent .
One patient had a maximum post - baseline QTcF value of greater than 500 msec , and one patient had a maximum QTcF change from baseline of greater than 60 msec .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of alectinib and its major active metabolite M4 have been characterized in patients with ALK - positive NSCLC and healthy subjects .
In patients with ALK - positive NSCLC , the geometric mean ( coefficient of variation % ) steady - state maximal concentration ( Cmax , ss ) for alectinib was 665 ng / mL ( 44 % ) and for M4 was 246 ng / mL ( 45 % ) with peak to trough concentration ratio of 1 . 2 .
The geometric mean steady - state area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours ( AUC0 - 12 h , ss ) for alectinib was 7 , 430 ng * h / mL ( 46 % ) and for M4 was 2 , 810 ng * h / mL ( 46 % ) .
Alectinib exposure is dose proportional across the dose range of 460 mg to 900 mg ( i . e . , 0 . 75 to 1 . 5 times the approved recommended dosage ) under fed conditions .
Alectinib and M4 reached steady - state concentrations by day 7 .
The geometric mean accumulation was approximately 6 - fold for both alectinib and M4 .
Absorption Alectinib reached maximal concentrations at 4 hours following administration of ALECENSA 600 mg twice daily under fed conditions in patients with ALK - positive NSCLC .
The absolute bioavailability of alectinib was 37 % ( 90 % CI : 34 % , 40 % ) under fed conditions .
A high - fat , high - calorie meal increased the combined exposure ( AUC0 - inf ) of alectinib plus M4 by 3 . 1 - fold ( 90 % CI : 2 . 7 , 3 . 6 ) following oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of ALECENSA .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution is 4 , 016 L for alectinib and 10 , 093 L for M4 .
Alectinib and M4 are bound to human plasma proteins greater than 99 % , independent of drug concentration .
Alectinib concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with ALK - positive NSCLC approximate estimated alectinib free concentrations in the plasma .
In vitro studies suggest that alectinib is not a substrate of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) , but M4 is a substrate of P - gp .
Alectinib and M4 are not substrates of breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , organic anion - transporting polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 , or OATP1B3 .
Elimination The apparent clearance ( CL / F ) is 81 . 9 L / hour for alectinib and 217 L / hour for M4 .
The geometric mean elimination half - life is 33 hours for alectinib and 31 hours for M4 in patients with ALK - positive NSCLC .
Metabolism Alectinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 to its major active metabolite M4 .
The geometric mean metabolite / parent exposure ratio at steady - state is 0 . 40 .
M4 is subsequently metabolized by CYP3A4 .
Alectinib and M4 were the main circulating moieties in plasma , constituting 76 % of the total radioactivity .
Excretion Ninety - eight percent of the radioactivity was excreted in feces following oral administration of a single radiolabeled dose of alectinib under fed conditions .
Eighty - four percent of the dose was excreted in the feces as unchanged alectinib , and 6 % of the dose was excreted as M4 .
Excretion of radioactivity in urine was less than 0 . 5 % of administered radiolabeled dose of alectinib .
Specific Populations Age ( 21 to 83 years ) , body weight ( 38 to 128 kg ) , mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin 1 to ≤ 1 . 5 × ULN and AST any value ) , mild to moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL / min ) , race ( White , Asian , and Other ) , and sex had no clinically meaningful effect on the systemic exposure of alectinib and M4 .
The pharmacokinetics of alectinib have not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min ) , or end - stage renal disease .
Hepatic Impairment : Following administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg ALECENSA , the geometric mean ratio [ 90 % confidence interval ] for the combined AUCinf of alectinib and M4 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh B ) was 1 . 36 [ 0 . 947 , 1 . 96 ] and in subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) was 1 . 76 [ 0 . 984 , 3 . 15 ] as compared to that in subjects with normal hepatic function .
The combined Cmax of alectinib and M4 was comparable among the three groups .
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment .
The recommended dose of ALECENSA in patients with severe hepatic impairment is 450 mg orally twice daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Alectinib No clinically meaningful effect on the combined exposure of alectinib plus M4 was observed in clinical studies following co - administration of ALECENSA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor ( posaconazole ) , a strong CYP3A inducer ( rifampin ) , or an acid - reducing agent ( esomeprazole ) .
Effect of Alectinib on Other Drugs No clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of midazolam ( sensitive CYP3A substrate ) or repaglinide ( sensitive CYP2C8 substrate ) is expected following co - administration with ALECENSA .
In vitro studies suggest that alectinib and M4 do not inhibit CYP1A2 , 2B6 , 2C9 , 2C19 or 2D6 .
In vitro studies suggest that alectinib and M4 inhibit P - gp and BCRP .
Alectinib did not inhibit OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OAT1 , OAT3 , or OCT2 transport activity in vitro .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with alectinib have not been conducted .
Alectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay , but was positive with an increased number of micronuclei in a rat bone marrow micronucleus test .
The mechanism of micronucleus induction was abnormal chromosome segregation ( aneugenicity ) and not a clastogenic effect on chromosomes .
No studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of alectinib on fertility .
No adverse effects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in general toxicology studies conducted in rats and monkeys .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Previously Untreated ALK - Positive Metastatic NSCLC The efficacy of ALECENSA for the treatment of patients with ALK - positive NSCLC who had not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease was established in an open - label , randomized , active - controlled , multicenter study ( ALEX : NCT02075840 ) .
Patients were required to have an ECOG performance status of 0 - 2 and ALK - positive NSCLC as identified by the VENTANA ALK ( D5F3 ) CDx assay .
Neurologically stable patients with treated or untreated central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases , including leptomeningeal metastases , were eligible ; patients with neurologic signs and symptoms due to CNS metastases were required to have completed whole brain radiation or gamma knife irradiation at least 14 days prior to enrollment and be clinically stable .
Patients with a baseline QTc > 470 ms were ineligible .
Patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive ALECENSA 600 mg orally twice daily or crizotinib 250 mg orally twice daily .
Randomization was stratified by ECOG performance status ( 0 / 1 vs . 2 ) , race ( Asian vs . non - Asian ) , and the presence or absence of CNS metastases at baseline .
Treatment on both arms was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
The major efficacy outcome measure was progression - free survival ( PFS ) as determined by investigator assessment according to RECIST v1 . 1 .
Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS as determined by independent review committee ( IRC ) , time to CNS progression by IRC based on RECIST v1 . 1 , objective response rate ( ORR ) and duration of response ( DOR ) , and overall survival ( OS ) .
Additional exploratory outcome measures were CNS objective response rate ( CNS - ORR ) and CNS duration of response ( CNS - DOR ) by IRC in patients with CNS metastases at baseline .
A total of 303 patients were randomized to ALECENSA ( n = 152 ) or crizotinib ( n = 151 ) .
The demographic characteristics of the study population were 56 % female , median age 56 years ( range : 18 to 91 years ) , 50 % White , 46 % Asian , 1 % Black , and 3 % other races .
The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma ( 92 % ) and never smoked ( 63 % ) .
CNS metastases were present in 40 % ( n = 122 ) of patients : of these , 43 patients had measurable CNS lesions as determined by an IRC .
The ALEX study demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS .
The time to cause - specific CNS progression as assessed by IRC was also significantly improved ; there was a lower incidence of progression in the CNS as the first site of disease progression , alone or with concurrent systemic progression , in the ALECENSA arm ( 12 % ) as compared to the crizotinib arm ( 45 % ) .
Efficacy results from ALEX are summarized in Table 7 and Figure 1 .
