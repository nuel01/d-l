1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Dopamine Hydrochloride in Dextrose Injection is indicated to improve hemodynamic status in patients in distributive shock , or shock due to reduced cardiac output .
Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection is a catecholamine indicated to improve hemodynamic status in patients in shock .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Correct hypovolemia , acidosis , and hypoxia prior to use .
( 2 . 1 ) • Administer in a large vein with an infusion pump preferably in an intensive care setting .
( 2 . 1 ) • Recommended starting dosage in adults and pediatric patients is 2 to 5 mcg / kg / minute as a continuous intravenous infusion .
Titrate in 5 to 10 mcg / kg / minute increments based on hemodynamic response and tolerability , up to not more than 50 mcg / kg / minute .
( 2 . 2 ) • See the Full Prescribing Information for important preparation instructions and drug incompatibilities .
( 2 . 3 ) 2 . 1 Administration Instructions Correct Hypovolemia , Acidosis , and Hypoxia Address hypovolemia , acidosis , and hypoxia before initiating Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection .
If patient does not respond to therapy , suspect occult hypovolemia .
Acidosis may reduce the effectiveness of dopamine [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Administration Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection is a premixed infusion solution that does not require dilution prior to intravenous administration .
Administer Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection into a large vein [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] with the use of an infusion pump preferably in an intensive care setting .
Remove outer wrap ( moisture and oxygen barrier ) only when ready to administer the product .
Discard product if outer wrap is damaged ( e . g . , tears or holes ) .
Inspect Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration ( the solution is clear to slightly yellow ) .
Do not administer if the solution is darker than slightly yellow or the container is damaged .
Use higher concentration premixed solutions ( e . g . , 3200 mcg / mL or 1600 mcg / mL strengths ) in patients requiring fluid restriction .
Discontinuation When discontinuing Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection , gradually reduce the infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dosage in adults and pediatric patients is 2 to 5 mcg / kg / minute as a continuous intravenous infusion [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Titrate the infusion rate in 5 to 10 mcg / kg / minute increments based on hemodynamic response and tolerability , up to but not more than 50 mcg / kg / minute .
Infusion rates may be calculated using the following formula : Infusion Rate ( mL / hour ) = [ Dose ( mcg / kg / minute ) × Weight ( kg ) × 60 ( minutes / hour ) ] Concentration ( mcg / mL ) Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows : Example 1 : for a 60 kg person at the recommended initial dose of 2 mcg / kg / minute using an 800 mcg / mL concentration , the infusion rate would be as follows : Infusion Rate ( mL / hour ) = [ 2 ( mcg / kg / minute ) × 60 ( kg ) × 60 ( minutes / hour ) ] = 9 ( mL / hour ) 800 ( mcg / mL ) Example 2 : for a 70 kg person at a dose of 5 mcg / kg / minute using a 3 , 200 mcg / mL concentration , the infusion rate would be as follows : Infusion Rate ( mL / hour ) = [ 5 ( mcg / kg / minute ) × 70 ( kg ) × 60 ( minutes / hour ) ] = 6 . 56 ( mL / hour ) 3200 ( mcg / mL ) 2 . 3 Drug Incompatibilities Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection is incompatible with the following products ; therefore , avoid simultaneous administration ( through the same infusion set ) : • Sodium bicarbonate or other alkalinizing substances , because dopamine is inactivated in alkaline solution .
• Blood , because of the risk of pseudoagglutination of red cells • Iron salts Do not add additional medications in the premixed infusion solution .

( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Tissue ischemia : Severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction can occur .
Address hypovolemia prior to use , monitor extremities , and infuse into large vein .
( 5 . 1 ) • Cardiac arrhythmias : Monitor closely .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypotension after abrupt discontinuation : Gradually reduce infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids .
( 5 . 3 ) • Severe hypersensitivity reactions due to sodium metabisulfite excipient : May cause anaphylaxis including life - threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in susceptible individuals .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of dopamine to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction , decreased renal perfusion and hypouresis , tissue hypoxia , lactic acidosis , and poor systemic blood flow despite " normal " blood pressure .
Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions .
Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients .
Extravasation of Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue .
To reduce the risk of extravasation , infuse into a large vein [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] , check the infusion site frequently for free flow , and monitor for signs of extravasation .
Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred , infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible , using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with : • 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection in adults • 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 mg / kg of phentolamine mesylate up to a maximum of 10 mg per dose in pediatric patients .
Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours .
5 . 2 Cardiac Arrhythmias Dopamine may cause arrhythmias .
Monitor patients with arrhythmias and treat appropriately .
5 . 3 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension .
Gradually reduce the infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids .
5 . 4 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions due to Sodium Metabisulfite Excipient Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection , contains sodium metabisulfite , a sulfite that may cause allergic - type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life - threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people .
The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low .
Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non - asthmatic people .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Tissue Ischemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Cardiac Arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of dopamine .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiac Disorders : anginal pain , palpitation Gastrointestinal Disorders : nausea , vomiting Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : azotemia Nervous System Disorders : headache , anxiety Respiratory Disorders : dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : piloerection Vascular Disorders : hypertension The most common adverse reaction is localized vasoconstriction due to extravasation .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with dopamine .
Table 1 : Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with DopamineHalogenated Anesthetics Clinical Impact : Concomitant use may increase cardiac autonomic irritability and can sensitize the myocardium to the action of dopamine which may lead to ventricular arrhythmias and hypertension .
Intervention : Monitor cardiac rhythm .
Examples : desflurane , enflurane , isoflurane , and sevoflurane .
MAO Inhibitors Clinical Impact : Because dopamine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) , inhibition of this enzyme prolongs and potentiates the effect of dopamine which may result in severe hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia .
Intervention : Reduce the recommended starting dosage to no greater than one - tenth ( 1 / 10 ) of the recommended dose in patients who have been treated with MAO inhibitors within two to three weeks prior to the administration of Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection .
Examples : isocarboxazid , phenelzine , tranylcypromine , rasagiline , selegiline , linezolid .
Tricyclic Antidepressants Clinical Impact : Concomitant use may potentiate the cardiovascular effects of dopamine ( e . g . , hypertension ) .
Intervention : Monitor blood pressure .
Examples : amitriptyline , desipramine , doxepin , imipramine , nortriptyline .
Vasopressors Clinical Impact : Concomitant use may result in severe hypertension .
Intervention : Monitor blood pressure .
Examples : norepinephrine , epinephrine , oxytocin .
• Halogenated anesthetics : Can sensitize the myocardium to the effects of dopamine and can produce ventricular arrhythmias and hypertension .
( 7 ) • MAO inhibitors : Risk of severe hypertension .
Reduce recommended Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection dosage .
( 7 ) • Tricyclic antidepressants : Risk of hypertension .
Monitor blood pressure .
( 7 ) • Vasopressors : Risk of severe hypertension .
Monitor blood pressure .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no human data with dopamine use in pregnant women .
There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with shock , which can be fatal if left untreated ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
In animal reproduction studies , adverse developmental outcomes were observed with intravenous dopamine HCl administration in pregnant rats during organogenesis at dosages , on a mcg / m2 basis , of one - third the human starting dosage of 2 mcg / kg / minute ( 90 mcg / m2 / minute ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies carry some risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4 % and 15 – 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Hypotension associated with distributive shock , or shock due to reduced cardiac output are medical emergencies in pregnancy which can be fatal if left untreated .
Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with distributive shock , or shock due to reduced cardiac output may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality .
Life - sustaining therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld due to potential concerns regarding the effects of dopamine on the fetus .
Labor or Delivery Vasopressor drugs , including dopamine , may cause severe maternal hypertension when used concomitantly with some oxytocic drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies in rats and rabbits at dopamine HCl dosages up to 6 mg / kg / day intravenously ( on a mcg / m2 basis , one - third and two - thirds , respectively , the human starting dosage of 2 mcg / kg / minute ) during organogenesis produced no detectable teratogenic or embryotoxic effects , although maternal toxicity consisting of mortalities , decreased body weight gain , and pharmacotoxic signs were observed in rats .
In a published study , administration of 10 mg / kg / day dopamine HCl ( on a mcg / m2 basis , two - thirds the human starting dosage of 2 mcg / kg / minute ) to pregnant rats throughout gestation or for 5 days starting on gestation day 10 or 15 resulted in decreased body weight gain , increased mortality , and slight increase in cataract formation among the offspring .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data regarding the presence of dopamine in human milk , the effects of dopamine on the breastfed infant , or the effects of the drug on milk production .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Dopamine HCl infusions have been used in pediatric patients from birth through adolescence .
Most reports in pediatric patients describe dosing that is similar ( on a mcg / kg / minute basis ) to that used in adults [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Except for vasoconstrictive effects caused by inadvertent infusion of dopamine into the umbilical artery , adverse reactions unique to pediatric patients have not been identified , nor have adverse reactions identified in adults been found to be more common in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of dopamine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
10 OVERDOSAGE Manifestations of overdosage include excessive blood pressure elevation .
In the case of accidental overdosage , reduce rate of Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection infusion , or temporarily discontinue the Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection infusion until the overdosage related adverse reactions resolves .
Since dopamine ' s duration of action is short , no additional remedial measures are usually necessary .
If these measures fail to resolve the overdosage related adverse reactions , consider using an alpha - adrenergic blocking agent ( e . g . , phentolamine ) .
11 DESCRIPTION Dopamine Hydrochloride in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , premixed solution of dopamine hydrochloride in 5 % dextrose injection for intravenous infusion .
Each 100 mL contains 80 mg ( 800 mcg / mL ) , 160 mg ( 1600 mcg / mL ) or 320 mg ( 3200 mcg / mL ) of dopamine HCl ; 5 grams of hydrous dextrose , in Water for Injection , and 50 mg of sodium metabisulfite ( a stabilizer ) ; pH = 3 . 8 ( 2 . 5 to 4 . 5 ) , and the following osmolar concentrations : 261 , 269 , or 286 mOsmol / liter , respectively .
May contain hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment .
Dopamine HCl is chemically designated 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenethylamine hydrochloride ( C8H11NO2 ∙ HCl ) , a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water .
Dopamine HCl has a molecular weight of 189 . 64 and it has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Dopamine ( also referred to as 3 - hydroxytyramine ) is a naturally occurring endogenous catecholamine .
Dextrose , USP is chemically designated D - glucose monohydrate ( C6H12O6 ∙ H2O ) , a hexose sugar freely soluble in water .
The molecular weight of dextrose ( D - glucose ) monohydrate is 198 . 17 and it has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H2O .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Dopamine is a natural catecholamine formed by the decarboxylation of 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylalanine ( DOPA ) .
It is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system , especially in the nigrostriatal tract , and in a few peripheral sympathetic nerves .
Dopamine elicits its pharmacological action by activating dopamine D1 and D2 receptors , beta - 1 receptors and alpha - 1 receptors .
The activation of different receptors leading to its effects are dependent on dopamine dose .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Dopamine ' s onset of action occurs within five minutes of intravenous administration and the duration of action is less than about ten minutes .
Dopamine effects are dosage - dependent .
• At < 5 mcg / kg / minute , dopamine HCl activates dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the renal , mesenteric , and coronary vasculature causing vasodilation .
• At 5 to 10 mcg / kg / minute , dopamine HCl activates beta - 1 receptors enhancing heart rate and contractility .
• At > 10 mcg / kg / minute , dopamine HCl activates alpha - 1 receptors causing vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Following intravenous administration , dopamine is widely distributed in the body but does not cross the blood - brain barrier to a significant extent .
Elimination The half - life of dopamine in adults is less than 2 minutes .
Metabolism About 75 % of dopamine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) and catechol O - methyl transferase ( COMT ) in the liver , kidney , and plasma to the inactive compounds homovanillic acid ( HVA ) and 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid , and about 25 % is metabolized to norepinephrine in the adrenergic nerve terminals .
Excretion About 80 % of dopamine is renally excreted as inactive metabolites within 24 hours .
Dopamine is stored in vesicles or diffused back into the plasma .
Specific Populations Pediatric Patients The reported clearance rate of dopamine in critically ill infants and pediatric patients ranged from 46 to 168 mL / kg / minute , with the higher values seen in the younger patients .
The reported apparent volume of distribution in neonates was 0 . 6 to 4 L / kg , leading to an elimination half - life of 5 to 11 minutes .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of dopamine .
Mutagenesis Dopamine HCl at doses approaching maximal solubility showed no clear genotoxic potential in the Ames test .
Although there was a reproducible dose - dependent increase in the number of revertant colonies with strains TA100 and TA98 , both with and without metabolic activation , the small increase was considered inconclusive evidence of mutagenicity .
In the L5178Y TK + / - mouse lymphoma assay , dopamine HCl at the highest concentrations used of 750 mcg / mL without metabolic activation , and 3000 mcg / mL with activation , was toxic and associated with increases in mutant frequencies when compared to untreated and solvent controls ; at the lower concentrations no increases over controls were noted .
No clear evidence of clastogenic potential was reported in the in vivo mouse or male rat bone marrow micronucleus test when the animals were treated intravenously with up to 224 mg / kg and 30 mg / kg of dopamine HCl , respectively .
