CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic / antihypertensive drug product that combines natriuretic and antikaliuretic effects .
Each component complements the action of the other .
The hydrochlorothiazide component blocks the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions , and thereby increases the quantity of sodium traversing the distal tubule and the volume of water excreted .
A portion of the additional sodium presented to the distal tubule is exchanged there for potassium and hydrogen ions .
With continued use of hydrochlorothiazide and depletion of sodium , compensatory mechanisms tend to increase this exchange and may produce excessive loss of potassium , hydrogen and chloride ions .
Hydrochlorothiazide also decreases the excretion of calcium and uric acid , may increase the excretion of iodide , and may reduce glomerular filtration rate .
The exact mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of hydrochlorothiazide is not known .
The triamterene component of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsule exerts its diuretic effect on the distal renal tubule to inhibit the reabsorption of sodium in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ions .
Its natriuretic activity is limited by the amount of sodium reaching its site of action .
Although it blocks the increase in this exchange that is stimulated by mineralocorticoids ( chiefly aldosterone ) , it is not a competitive antagonist of aldosterone and its activity can be demonstrated in adrenalectomized rats and patients with Addison ’ s disease .
As a result , the dose of triamterene required is not proportionally related to the level of mineralocorticoid activity , but is dictated by the response of the individual patients , and the kaliuretic effect of concomitantly administered drugs .
By inhibiting the distal tubular exchange mechanism , triamterene maintains or increases the sodium excretion and reduces the excess loss of potassium , hydrogen , and chloride ions induced by hydrochlorothiazide .
As with hydrochlorothiazide , triamterene may reduce glomerular filtration and renal plasma flow .
Via this mechanism it may reduce uric acid excretion although it has no tubular effect on uric acid reabsorption or secretion .
Triamterene does not affect calcium excretion .
No predictable antihypertensive effect has been demonstrated for triamterene .
Duration of diuretic activity and effective dosage range of the hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene components are similar .
Onset of diuresis with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide takes place within one hour , peaks at two to three hours and tapers off during the subsequent seven to nine hours .
Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsule are well absorbed .
Upon administration of a single oral dose to fasted normal male volunteers , the following mean pharmacokinetic parameters were determined : AUC ( 0 - 48 ) ng * hrs / mL ( ± SD ) C max ng / mL ( ± SD ) Median T max Hrs Ae mg ( ± SD ) triamterene 148 . 7 ( 87 . 9 ) 46 . 4 ( 29 . 4 ) 1 . 1 2 . 7 ( 1 . 4 ) hydroxytriamterene sulfate 1865 ( 471 ) 720 ( 364 ) 1 . 3 19 . 7 ( 6 . 1 ) hydrochlorothiazide 834 ( 177 ) 135 . 1 ( 35 . 7 ) 2 . 0 14 . 3 ( 3 . 8 ) Where AUC ( 0 - 48 ) , C max , T max and Ae represent area under the plasma concentration versus time plot , maximum plasma concentration , time to reach C max and amount excreted in urine over 48 hours .
One triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsule is bioequivalent to a single - entity 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide tablet and 37 . 5 mg triamterene capsule used in the double - blind clinical trial below .
( See Clinical Trials . )
In a limited study involving 12 subjects , coadministration of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsule with a high - fat meal resulted in : ( 1 ) an increase in the mean bioavailability of triamterene by about 67 % ( 90 % confidence interval = 0 . 99 , 1 . 90 ) , p - hydroxytriamterene sulfate by about 50 % ( 90 % confidence interval = 1 . 06 , 1 . 77 ) , hydrochlorothiazide by about 17 % ( 90 % confidence interval = 0 . 90 , 1 . 34 ) ; ( 2 ) increases in the peak concentrations of triamterene and p - hydroxytriamterene ; and ( 3 ) a delay of up to 2 hours in the absorption of the active constituents .
Clinical Trials A placebo - controlled , double - blind trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules .
This trial demonstrated that triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules 37 . 5 mg / 25 mg were effective in controlling blood pressure while reducing the incidence of hydrochlorothiazide - induced hypokalemia .
This trial involved 636 patients with mild to moderate hypertension controlled by hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily and who had hypokalemia ( serum potassium < 3 . 5 mEq / L ) secondary to the hydrochlorothiazide .
Patients were randomly assigned to 4 weeks ’ treatment with once - daily regimens of 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide plus placebo , or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide combined with one of the following doses of triamterene : 25 mg , 37 . 5 mg , 50 mg or 75 mg .
Blood pressure and serum potassium were monitored at baseline and throughout the trial .
All five treatment groups had similar mean blood pressure and serum potassium concentrations at baseline ( mean systolic blood pressure range : 137 ± 14 mmHg to 140 ± 16 mmHg ; mean diastolic blood pressure range : 86 ± 9 mmHg to 88 ± 8 mmHg ; mean serum potassium range : 2 . 3 to 3 . 4 mEq / L with the majority of patients having values between 3 . 1 and 3 . 4 mEq / L ) .
While all triamterene regimens reversed hypokalemia , at week 4 the 37 . 5 mg regimen proved optimal compared with the other tested regimens .
On this regimen , 81 % of the patients had a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) reversal of hypokalemia vs . 59 % of patients on the placebo / hydrochlorothiazide regimen .
The mean serum potassium concentration on 37 . 5 mg triamterene went from 3 . 2 ± 0 . 2 mEq / L at baseline to 3 . 7 ± 0 . 3 mEq / L at week 4 , a significantly greater ( p < 0 . 05 ) improvement than that achieved with placebo / hydrochlorothiazide ( i . e . , 3 . 2 ± 0 . 2 mEq / L at baseline and 3 . 5 ± 0 . 4 mEq / L at week 4 ) .
Also , 51 % of patients in the 37 . 5 mg triamterene group had an increase in serum potassium of ≥ 0 . 5 mEq / L at week 4 vs . 33 % in the placebo group .
The 37 . 5 mg triamterene / 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide regimen also maintained control of blood pressure ; mean supine systolic blood pressure at week 4 was 138 ± 21 mmHg while mean supine diastolic blood pressure was 87 ± 13 mmHg .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE This fixed combination drug is not indicated for the initial therapy of edema or hypertension except in individuals in whom the development of hypokalemia cannot be risked .
Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules are indicated for the treatment of hypertension or edema in patients who develop hypokalemia on hydrochlorothiazide alone .
Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules are also indicated for those patients who require a thiazide diuretic and in whom the development of hypokalemia cannot be risked .
Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may be used alone or as an adjunct to other antihypertensive drugs , such as beta - blockers .
Since triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may enhance the action of these agents , dosage adjustments may be necessary .
Usage in Pregnancy The routine use of diuretics in an otherwise healthy woman is inappropriate and exposes mother and fetus to unnecessary hazard .
Diuretics do not prevent development of toxemia of pregnancy , and there is no satisfactory evidence that they are useful in the treatment of developed toxemia .
Edema during pregnancy may arise from pathological causes or from the physiologic and mechanical consequences of pregnancy .
Diuretics are indicated in pregnancy when edema is due to pathologic causes , just as they are in the absence of pregnancy .
Dependent edema in pregnancy resulting from restriction of venous return by the expanded uterus is properly treated through elevation of the lower extremities and use of support hose ; use of diuretics to lower intravascular volume in this case is illogical and unnecessary .
There is hypervolemia during normal pregnancy which is harmful to neither the fetus nor the mother ( in the absence of cardiovascular disease ) , but which is associated with edema , including generalized edema in the majority of pregnant women .
If this edema produces discomfort , increased recumbency will often provide relief .
In rare instances this edema may cause extreme discomfort which is not relieved by rest .
In these cases a short course of diuretics may provide relief and may be appropriate .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Antikaliuretic Therapy and Potassium Supplementation Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should not be given to patients receiving other potassium - sparing agents such as spironolactone , amiloride , or other formulations containing triamterene .
Concomitant potassium - containing salt substitutes should also not be used .
Potassium supplementation should not be used with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide except in severe cases of hypokalemia .
Such concomitant therapy can be associated with rapid increases in serum potassium levels .
If potassium supplementation is used , careful monitoring of the serum potassium level is necessary .
Impaired Renal Function Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients with anuria , acute and chronic renal insufficiency or significant renal impairment .
Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity to either drug in the preparation or to other sulfonamide - derived drugs is a contraindication .
Hyperkalemia Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should not be used in patients with preexisting elevated serum potassium .
WARNINGS Hyperkalemia : Abnormal elevation of serum potassium levels ( greater than or equal to 5 . 5 mEq / liter ) can occur with all potassium - sparing diuretic combinations , including triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide .
Hyperkalemia is more likely to occur in patients with renal impairment and diabetes ( even without evidence of renal impairment ) , and in the elderly or severely ill .
Since uncorrected hyperkalemia may be fatal , serum potassium levels must be monitored at frequent intervals especially in patients first receiving triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide , when dosages are changed or with any illness that may influence renal function .
If hyperkalemia is suspected ( warning signs include paresthesias , muscular weakness , fatigue , flaccid paralysis of the extremities , bradycardia , and shock ) , an electrocardiogram ( ECG ) should be obtained .
However , it is important to monitor serum potassium levels because hyperkalemia may not be associated with ECG changes .
If hyperkalemia is present , triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued immediately and a thiazide alone should be substituted .
If the serum potassium exceeds 6 . 5 mEq / liter more vigorous therapy is required .
The clinical situation dictates the procedures to be employed .
These include the intravenous administration of calcium chloride solution , sodium bicarbonate solution , and / or the oral or parenteral administration of glucose with a rapid - acting insulin preparation .
Cationic exchange resins such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate may be orally or rectally administered .
Persistent hyperkalemia may require dialysis .
The development of hyperkalemia associated with potassium - sparing diuretics is accentuated in the presence of renal impairment ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS section ) .
Patients with mild renal functional impairment should not receive this drug without frequent and continuing monitoring of serum electrolytes .
Cumulative drug effects may be observed in patients with impaired renal function .
The renal clearances of hydrochlorothiazide and the pharmacologically active metabolite of triamterene , the sulfate ester of hydroxytriamterene , have been shown to be reduced and the plasma levels increased following triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide administration to elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function .
Hyperkalemia has been reported in diabetic patients with the use of potassium - sparing agents even in the absence of apparent renal impairment .
Accordingly , serum electrolytes must be frequently monitored if triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide is used in diabetic patients .
Metabolic or Respiratory Acidosis Potassium - sparing therapy should also be avoided in severely ill patients in whom respiratory or metabolic acidosis may occur .
Acidosis may be associated with rapid elevations in serum potassium levels .
If triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide is employed , frequent evaluations of acid / base balance and serum electrolytes are necessary .
Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle - Closure Glaucoma Hydrochlorothiazide , a sulfonamide , can cause an idiosyncratic reaction , resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle - closure glaucoma .
Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation .
Untreated acute angle - closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss .
The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible .
Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled .
Risk factors for developing acute angle - closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy .
PRECAUTIONS Diabetes Caution should be exercised when administering triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide to patients with diabetes , since thiazides may cause hyperglycemia , glycosuria , and alter insulin requirements in diabetes .
Also , diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide administration .
Impaired Hepatic Function Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function .
They can precipitate hepatic coma in patients with severe liver disease .
Potassium depletion induced by the thiazide may be important in this connection .
Administer triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide cautiously and be alert for such early signs of impending coma as confusion , drowsiness , and tremor ; if mental confusion increases discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide for a few days .
Attention must be given to other factors that may precipitate hepatic coma , such as blood in the gastrointestinal tract or preexisting potassium depletion .
Hypokalemia Hypokalemia is uncommon with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide but , should it develop , corrective measures should be taken such as potassium supplementation or increased intake of potassium - rich foods .
Institute such measures cautiously with frequent determinations of serum potassium levels , especially in patients receiving digitalis or with a history of cardiac arrhythmias .
If serious hypokalemia ( serum potassium less than 3 . 0 mEq / L ) is demonstrated by repeat serum potassium determinations , triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued and potassium chloride supplementation initiated .
Less serious hypokalemia should be evaluated with regard to other coexisting conditions and treated accordingly .
Electrolyte Imbalance Electrolyte imbalance , often encountered in such conditions as heart failure , renal disease or cirrhosis of the liver , may also be aggravated by diuretics and should be considered during therapy with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide when using high doses for prolonged periods or in patients on a salt - restricted diet .
Serum determinations of electrolytes should be performed , and are particularly important if the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving fluids parenterally .
Possible fluid and electrolyte imbalance may be indicated by such warning signs as : dry mouth , thirst , weakness , lethargy , drowsiness , restlessness , muscle pain or cramps , muscular fatigue , hypotension , oliguria , tachycardia , and gastrointestinal symptoms .
Hypochloremia Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances ( as in liver disease or renal disease ) , chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis .
Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather ; appropriate therapy is water restriction , rather than administration of salt , except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening .
In actual salt depletion , appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice .
Renal Stones Triamterene has been found in renal stones in association with the other usual calculus components .
Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution in patients with a history of renal stones .
Laboratory Tests Serum Potassium The normal adult range of serum potassium is 3 . 5 to 5 . 0 mEq per liter with 4 . 5 mEq often being used for a reference point .
If hypokalemia should develop , corrective measures should be taken such as potassium supplementation or increased dietary intake of potassium - rich foods .
Institute such measures cautiously with frequent determinations of serum potassium levels .
Potassium levels persistently above 6 mEq per liter require careful observation and treatment .
Serum potassium levels do not necessarily indicate true body potassium concentration .
A rise in plasma pH may cause a decrease in plasma potassium concentration and an increase in the intracellular potassium concentration .
Discontinue corrective measures for hypokalemia immediately if laboratory determinations reveal an abnormal elevation of serum potassium .
Discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide and substitute a thiazide diuretic alone until potassium levels return to normal .
Serum Creatinine and BUN Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may produce an elevated blood urea nitrogen level , creatinine level or both .
This apparently is secondary to a reversible reduction of glomerular filtration rate or a depletion of intravascular fluid volume ( prerenal azotemia ) rather than renal toxicity ; levels usually return to normal when triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide is discontinued .
If azotemia increases , discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide .
Periodic BUN or serum creatinine determinations should be made , especially in elderly patients and in patients with suspected or confirmed renal insufficiency .
Serum PBI Thiazide may decrease serum PBI levels without sign of thyroid disturbance .
Parathyroid Function Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function .
Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides .
Pathologic changes in the parathyroid glands with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy .
The common complications of hyperparathyroidism such as bone resorption and peptic ulceration have not been seen .
Drug Interactions Angiotensin - converting Enzyme Inhibitors Potassium - sparing agents should be used with caution in conjunction with angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors due to an increased risk of hyperkalemia .
Oral Hypoglycemic Drugs Concurrent use with chlorpropamide may increase the risk of severe hyponatremia .
Nonsteroidal Anti - inflammatory Drugs A possible interaction resulting in acute renal failure has been reported in a few patients on triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide when treated with indomethacin , a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory agent .
Caution is advised in administering nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory agents with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide .
Lithium Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and increase the risk of lithium toxicity .
Read circulars for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide .
Surgical Considerations Thiazides have been shown to decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine ( an effect attributed to loss of sodium ) .
This diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use .
Thiazides have also been shown to increase the paralyzing effect of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants such as tubocurarine ( an effect attributed to potassium loss ) ; consequently caution should be observed in patients undergoing surgery .
Other Considerations Concurrent use of hydrochlorothiazide with amphotericin B or corticosteroids or corticotropin ( ACTH ) may intensify electrolyte imbalance , particularly hypokalemia , although the presence of triamterene minimizes the hypokalemic effect .
Thiazides may add to or potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs .
See INDICATIONS AND USAGE for concomitant use with other antihypertensive drugs .
The effect of oral anticoagulants may be decreased when used concurrently with hydrochlorothiazide ; dosage adjustments may be necessary .
Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of blood uric acid ; dosage adjustments of antigout medication may be necessary to control hyperuricemia and gout .
The following agents given together with triamterene may promote serum potassium accumulation and possibly result in hyperkalemia because of the potassium - sparing nature of triamterene , especially in patients with renal insufficiency : blood from blood bank ( may contain up to 30 mEq of potassium per liter of plasma or up to 65 mEq per liter of whole blood when stored for more than 10 days ) ; low - salt milk ( may contain up to 60 mEq of potassium per liter ) ; potassium - containing medications ( such as parenteral penicillin G potassium ) ; salt substitutes ( most contain substantial amounts of potassium ) .
Exchange resins , such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate , whether administered orally or rectally , reduce serum potassium levels by sodium replacement of the potassium ; fluid retention may occur in some patients because of the increased sodium intake .
Chronic or overuse of laxatives may reduce serum potassium levels by promoting excessive potassium loss from the intestinal tract ; laxatives may interfere with the potassium - retaining effects of triamterene .
The effectiveness of methenamine may be decreased when used concurrently with hydrochlorothiazide because of alkalinization of the urine .
Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions Triamterene and quinidine have similar fluorescence spectra ; thus , triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide will interfere with the fluorescent measurement of quinidine .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term studies have not been conducted with the triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide combination , or with triamterene alone .
Hydrochlorothiazide Two - year feeding studies in mice and rats , conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program ( NTP ) , treated mice and rats with doses of hydrochlorothiazide up to 600 and 100 mg / kg / day , respectively .
On a body - weight basis , these doses are 600 times ( in mice ) and 100 times ( in rats ) the Maximum Recommended Human Dose ( MRHD ) for the hydrochlorothiazide component of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules at 50 mg / day ( or 1 . 0 mg / kg / day based on 50 kg individuals ) .
On the basis of body - surface area , these doses are 56 times ( in mice ) and 21 times ( in rats ) the MRHD .
These studies uncovered no evidence of carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in rats or female mice , but there was equivocal evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice .
Mutagenesis Studies of the mutagenic potential of the triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide combination , or of triamterene alone have not been performed .
Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in in vitro assays using strains TA 98 , TA 100 , TA 1535 , TA 1537 and TA 1538 of Salmonella typhimurium ( the Ames test ) ; in the Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) test for chromosomal aberrations ; or in in vivo assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes , Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes , and the Drosophila sex - linked recessive lethal trait gene .
Positive test results were obtained in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange ( clastogenicity ) test , and in the mouse Lymphoma Cell ( mutagenicity ) assays , using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide of 43 to 1300 mcg / mL .
Positive test results were also obtained in the Aspergillus nidulans nondisjunction assay , using an unspecified concentration of hydrochlorothiazide .
Impairment of Fertility Studies of the effects of the triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide combination , or of triamterene alone on animal reproductive function have not been conducted .
Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed , via their diet , to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg / kg / day , respectively , prior to mating and throughout gestation .
Corresponding multiples of the MRHD are 100 ( mice ) and 4 ( rats ) on the basis of body - weight and 9 . 4 ( mice ) and 0 . 8 ( rats ) on the basis of body - surface area .
Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Teratogenic Effects Triamterene and Hydrochlorothiazide Animal reproduction studies to determine the potential for fetal harm by triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide have not been conducted .
However , a One Generation Study in the rat approximated triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide composition by using a 1 : 1 ratio of triamterene to hydrochlorothiazide ( 30 : 30 mg / kg / day ) ; there was no evidence of teratogenicity at those doses which were , on a body - weight basis , 15 and 30 times , respectively , the MRHD , and on the basis of body - surface area , 3 . 1 and 6 . 2 times , respectively , the MRHD .
The safe use of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide in pregnancy has not been established since there are no adequate and well - controlled studies with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide in pregnant women .
Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus .
Triamterene Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses as high as 20 times the MRHD on the basis of body - weight , and 6 times the human dose on the basis of body - surface area without evidence of harm to the fetus due to triamterene .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide was orally administered to pregnant mice and rats during respective periods of major organogenesis at doses up to 3 , 000 and 1 , 000 mg / kg / day , respectively .
At these doses , which are multiples of the MRHD equal to 3 , 000 for mice and 1 , 000 for rats , based on body - weight , and equal to 282 for mice and 206 for rats , based on body - surface area , there was no evidence of harm to the fetus .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nonteratogenic Effects Thiazides and triamterene have been shown to cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood .
The use of thiazides and triamterene in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against possible hazards to the fetus .
These hazards include fetal or neonatal jaundice , pancreatitis , thrombocytopenia and possible other adverse reactions which have occurred in the adult .
Nursing Mothers Thiazides and triamterene in combination have not been studied in nursing mothers .
Triamterene appears in animal milk ; this may occur in humans .
Thiazides are excreted in human breast milk .
If use of the combination drug product is deemed essential , the patient should stop nursing .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
