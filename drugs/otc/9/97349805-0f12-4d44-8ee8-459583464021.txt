® A CLEANER MOUTH A HEALTHIER YOU ® ClōSYS ® SILVER ® Serious Science for Sensitive Mouths ™ Our Story Founder of CloSYS ® & Periodontist Dr . Perry Ratcliff had a bold belief that there had to be a better / gentler way to help with oral care .
Dr . Ratcliff did n't agree with the common myth ‘ If it hurts , it must be good for you . ’
CloSYS ® took a different approach — keep it gentle , yet effective , and people will use it long enough to make a difference in their oral health .
After discovering that his first patented formula was not only extremely gentle but incredibly effective , he gathered a small group of dental professionals and business leaders to start their journey toward what is today CloSYS ® Oral Care What Makes CloSYS ® Product Different ?
Simply put , CloSYS ® is the Gentlest .
Oral Care .
Ever .
® All CloSYS ® formulas are pH balanced , highly effective and extremely gentle so they are not harsh or irritating to sensitive mouths .
And because it ’ s so gentle , it means you can swish it in your mouth longer without having to spit it out early and risk not getting the full benefit of the rinse .
CloSYS ® products are free of alcohol , sulfates , triclosan , and other harsh ingredients that can burn or irritate sensitive mouths .
