DESCRIPTION : NEXAVIR ® Injection ( liver derivative complex ) is a sterile solution containing 25 . 5 mg liver derivative complex per ml in sterile water for injection .
NEXAVIR ® Injection is composed of peptides and amino acids .
The product contains no protein and does not exhibit anti - anemia activity .
NEXAVIR ® Injection also contains as inactive ingredients : phenol 0 . 5 % , sterile water for Injection , pH is adjusted with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide when necessary .
CLINICAL PHARMACOI . OGY : The specific action of NEXAVIR ® is to enhance the resolution of inflammation and edema .
In the late 1920 ' s , it was demonstrated that liver was of benefit to patients suffering from acne vulgaris .
1 As a consequence , various techniques were employed for isolating the active " factor " from liver .
Studies published in the late 1930 ' s and early 1940 ' s 2 , 3 , 4 showed activity in a specially purified liver fraction .
During subsequent years , refinements in the isolation of the active material led to the marketing of NEXAVIR ® .
Initially it was thought that the primary action of NEXAVIR ® was on the capillaries and precapillary sphincters .
However , it is now believed that this effect is a secondary one and that the primary action of NEXAVIR ® is in response to injury at the cellular level .
The capillary changes observed following administration of NEXAVIR ® appear to be part of a more fundamental anti - inflammatory effect .
In the normal animal , no consistent pharmacodynamic action has been demonstrated for NEXAVIR ® .
In particular , there is no effect on systemic blood pressure , no action on the autonomic nervous system and no alteration in prothrombin , coagulation or bleeding times .
It is concluded that the specific action of the product is only apparent when tissues have been subjected to injury and when inflammation and edema are present .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE : A wide range of dermatological clinical conditions benefit from NEXAVIR ® therapy .
The common denominator in these varied conditions is the presence of inflammation and edema .
Favourable responses to the administration of NEXAVIR ® in patients with acne vulgaris 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , herpes zoster , " poison ivy " dermatitis , pityriasis rosea , seborrheic dermatitis , urticaria and eczema 9 , 10 , 11 , severe sunburn 12 and rosacea 13 have been reported .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : Contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity or intolerance to liver or pork products .
WARNING : Use with caution in patients suspected of being hypersensitive to liver or with other allergic diatheses .
PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions : NEXAVIR ® contains tyramine and should not be administered to patients taking MAO inhibitors because hypertensive crisis may occur .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : No long - term animal studies have examined the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of NEXAVIR ® .
NEXAVIR ® s effect upon reproductive capacity is similarly unknown .
Pregnancy - Pregnancy Category C : Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with NEXAVIR ® .
It is also not known whether NEXAVIR ® can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
NEXAVIR ® should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when NEXAVIR ® is administered to a nursing woman .
