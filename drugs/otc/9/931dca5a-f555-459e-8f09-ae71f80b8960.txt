DESCRIPTION ENABLEX ® ( darifenacin ) is an extended - release tablet which contains 7 . 5 mg or 15 mg darifenacin as its hydrobromide salt .
The active moiety , darifenacin , is a potent muscarinic receptor antagonist .
Chemically , darifenacin hydrobromide is ( S ) - 2 - { 1 - [ 2 - ( 2 , 3 - dihydrobenzofuran - 5 - yl ) ethyl ] - 3 - pyrrolidinyl } - 2 , 2 - diphenylacetamide hydrobromide .
The empirical formula of darifenacin hydrobromide is C28H30N2O2 . HBr .
The structural formula is [ MULTIMEDIA ] Darifenacin hydrobromide is a white to almost white , crystalline powder , with a molecular weight of 507 . 5 .
ENABLEX is a once a day extended release tablet and contains the following inactive ingredients : dibasic calcium phosphate , hypromellose ( hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ) , magnesium stearate , polyethylene glycol , talc , titanium dioxide .
The 15 - mg tablet also contains iron oxide red and iron oxide yellow .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY [ MULTIMEDIA ] General Darifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist .
Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions , including contractions of the urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion .
In vitro studies using human recombinant muscarinic receptor subtypes show that darifenacin has greater affinity for the M3 receptor than for the other known muscarinic receptors ( 9 - and 12 - fold greater affinity for M3 compared to M1 and M5 , respectively , and 59 - fold greater affinity for M3 compared to both M2 and M4 ) .
M3 receptors are involved in contraction of human bladder and gastrointestinal smooth muscle , saliva production , and iris sphincter function .
Adverse drug effects such as dry mouth , constipation and abnormal vision may be mediated through effects on M3 receptors in these organs .
Pharmacodynamics In three cystometric studies performed in patients with involuntary detrusor contractions , increased bladder capacity was demonstrated by an increased volume threshold for unstable contractions and diminished frequency of unstable detrusor contractions after ENABLEX ® ( darifenacin ) extended - release tablet treatment .
These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the urinary bladder .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration of ENABLEX to healthy volunteers , peak plasma concentrations of darifenacin are reached approximately seven hours after multiple dosing and steady - state plasma concentrations are achieved by the sixth day of dosing .
The mean ( SD ) steady - state time course of ENABLEX 7 . 5 mg and 15 mg extended - release tablets is depicted in Figure 1 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] * Includes 95 EMs and 6 PMs for 7 . 5 mg ; 104 EMs and 10 PMs for 15 mg .
A summary of mean ( standard deviation , SD ) steady - state pharmacokinetic parameters of ENABLEX 7 . 5 mg and 15 mg extended - release tablets in extensive ( EMs ) and poor ( PMs ) metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 1 .

Regarding EM and PM , see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics , Variability in Metabolism .
The mean oral bioavailability of ENABLEX in EMs at steady state is estimated to be 15 % and 19 % for 7 . 5 - mg and 15 - mg tablets , respectively .
Effect of Food There is no effect of food on multiple - dose pharmacokinetics from ENABLEX extended - release tablets .
Distribution Darifenacin is approximately 98 % bound to plasma proteins ( primarily to alpha - 1 - acid - glycoprotein ) .
The steady - state volume of distribution ( Vss ) is estimated to be 163 L . Metabolism Darifenacin is extensively metabolized by the liver following oral dosing .
Metabolism is mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 .
The three main metabolic routes are as follows : • monohydroxylation in the dihydrobenzofuran ring ; • dihydrobenzofuran ring opening ; • N - dealkylation of the pyrrolidine nitrogen .
The initial products of the hydroxylation and N - dealkylation pathways are the major circulating metabolites but they are unlikely to contribute significantly to the overall clinical effect of darifenacin .
Variability in Metabolism A subset of individuals ( approximately 7 % Caucasians and 2 % African Americans ) are poor metabolizers ( PMs ) of CYP2D6 metabolized drugs .
Individuals with normal CYP2D6 activity are referred to as extensive metabolizers ( EMs ) .
The metabolism of darifenacin in PMs will be principally mediated via CYP3A4 .
The darifenacin ratios ( PM : EM ) for Cmax and AUC following darifenacin 15 mg once - daily at steady state were 1 . 9 and 1 . 7 , respectively .
Excretion Following administration of an oral dose of 14 C - darifenacin solution to healthy volunteers , approximately 60 % of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 40 % in the feces .
Only a small percentage of the excreted dose was unchanged darifenacin ( 3 % ) .
Estimated darifenacin clearance is 40 L / h for EMs and 32 L / h for PMs .
The elimination half - life of darifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 13 - 19 hours .
Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age : No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly .
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of patient data indicated a trend for clearance of darifenacin to decrease with age ( 6 % per decade relative to a median age of 44 ) .
Following administration of ENABLEX 15 mg once - daily , darifenacin exposure at steady state was approximately 12 % - 19 % higher in volunteers between 45 and 65 years of age compared to younger volunteers aged 18 to 44 years ( see PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use ) .
Pediatric : The pharmacokinetics of ENABLEX have not been studied in the pediatric population .
Gender : No dose adjustment is recommended based on gender .
PK parameters were calculated for 22 male and 25 female healthy volunteers .
Darifenacin Cmax and AUC at steady state were approximately 57 % - 79 % and 61 % - 73 % higher in females than in males , respectively .
Race : The effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of ENABLEX has not been characterized .
Renal Insufficiency : No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment .
A study of subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment ( creatinine clearance between 10 and 136 mL / min ) given ENABLEX 15 mg once dailyto steady state demonstrated no clear relationship between renal function and darifenacin clearance .
Hepatic Insufficiency : The daily dose of ENABLEX should not exceed 7 . 5 mg once daily for patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh B ) ( see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh A ) .
ENABLEX pharmacokinetics were investigated in subjects with mild ( Child Pugh A ) or moderate ( Child Pugh B ) impairment of hepatic function given ENABLEX 15 mg once daily to steady state .
Mild hepatic impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of darifenacin .
However , protein binding of darifenacin was affected by moderate hepatic impairment .
After adjusting for plasma protein binding , unbound darifenacin exposure was estimated to be 4 . 7 - fold higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than subjects with normal hepatic function .
Subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh C ) have not been studied , therefore ENABLEX is not recommended for use in these patients ( see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Drug - Drug Interactions Effects of Other Drugs on Darifenacin Darifenacin metabolism is primarily mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 .
Therefore , inducers of CYP3A4 or inhibitors of either of these enzymes may alter darifenacin pharmacokinetics .
CYP2D6 Inhibitors : No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors .
Darifenacin exposure following 30 mg once daily at steady state was 33 % higher in the presence of the potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine 20 mg .
CYP3A4 Inhibitors : The daily dose of ENABLEX should not exceed 7 . 5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir , nelfinavir , clarithromycin and nefazodone ) ( see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
In a drug interaction study , when a 7 . 5 mg once - dailydose of ENABLEX was given to steady state and coadministered with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg , mean darifenacin Cmax increased to 11 . 2 ng / mL for EMs ( n = 10 ) and 55 . 4 ng / mL for one PM subject ( n = 1 ) .
Mean AUC increased to 143 and 939 ng . h / mL for EMs and for one PM subject , respectively .
When a 15 mg daily dose of ENABLEX was given with ketoconazole , mean darifenacin Cmax increased to 67 . 6 ng / mL and 58 . 9 ng / mL for EMs ( n = 3 ) and one PM subject ( n = 1 ) , respectively .
Mean AUC increased to 1110 and 931 ng . h / mL for EMs and for one PM subject , respectively .
No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , erythromycin , fluconazole , diltiazem and verapamil ) .
The mean Cmax and AUC of darifenacin following 30 mg once - daily dosing at steady state were 128 % and 95 % higher , respectively , in the presence of erythromycin .
Coadministration of fluconazole and darifenacin 30 mg once daily at steady state increased darifenacin Cmax and AUC by 88 % and 84 % , respectively .
The mean Cmax and AUC of darifenacin following 30 mg once daily at steady state were 42 % and 34 % higher , respectively , in the presence of cimetidine , a mixed CYP P450 enzyme inhibitor .
Effects of Darifenacin on Other Drugs In Vitro Studies : Based on in vitro human microsomal studies , ENABLEX is not expected to inhibit CYP1A2 or CYP2C9 at clinically relevant concentrations .
In Vivo Studies : The potential for clinical doses of ENABLEX to act as inhibitors of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 substrates was investigated in specific drug interaction studies .
CYP2D6 Substrates : Caution should be taken when ENABLEX is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window , such as flecainide , thioridazine and tricyclic antidepressants ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) .
The mean Cmax and AUC of imipramine , a CYP2D6 substrate , were increased 57 % and 70 % , respectively , in the presence of steady - state darifenacin 30 mg once daily .
This was accompanied by a 3 . 6 - fold increase in the mean Cmax and AUC of desipramine , the active metabolite of imipramine .
CYP3A4 Substrates : Darifenacin ( 30 mg daily ) coadministered with a single oral dose of midazolam 7 . 5 mg resulted in a 17 % increase in midazolam exposure .
Darifenacin ( 10 mg t . i . d . ) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of the combination oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol .
Other Drugs : Darifenacin had no significant effect on prothrombin time when a single dose of warfarin 30 mg was coadministered with darifenacin ( 30 mg daily ) at steady state .
Standard therapeutic prothrombin time monitoring for warfarin should be continued .
Routine therapeutic drug monitoring for digoxin should be continued .
Darifenacin ( 30 mg daily ) coadministered with digoxin ( 0 . 25 mg ) at steady state resulted in a 16 % increase in digoxin exposure .
Electrophysiology The effect of six - day treatment of 15 - mg and 75 - mg ENABLEX on QT / QTc interval was evaluated in a multiple - dose , double - blind , randomized , placebo - and active - controlled ( moxifloxacin 400 mg ) parallel - arm design study in 179 healthy adults ( 44 % male , 56 % female ) aged 18 to 65 .
Subjects included 18 % PMs and 82 % EMs .
The QT interval was measured over a 24 - hour period both predosing and at steady state .
The 75 - mg ENABLEX dose was chosen because this achieves exposure similar to that observed in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers administered the highest recommended dose ( 15 mg ) of darifenacin in the presence of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor .
At the doses studied , ENABLEX did not result in QT / QTc interval prolongation at any time during the steady state , while moxifloxacin treatment resulted in a mean increase from baseline QTcF of about 7 . 0 msec when compared to placebo .
In this study , darifenacin 15 - mg and 75 - mg doses demonstrated a mean heart rate change of 3 . 1 and 1 . 3 bpm , respectively , when compared to placebo .
However , in the Phase II / III clinical studies , the change in median HR following treatment with ENABLEX was no different from placebo .
CLINICAL STUDIES ENABLEX ® ( darifenacin ) extended - release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urgency , urge urinary incontinence , and increased urinary frequency in three randomized , fixed - dose , placebo - controlled , multicenter , double - blind , 12 - week studies ( Studies 1 , 2 and 3 ) and one randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter , dose - titration study ( Study 4 ) .
For study eligibility in all four studies , patients with symptoms of overactive bladder for at least six months were required to demonstrate at least eight micturitions and at least one episode of urinary urgency per day , and at least five episodes of urge urinary incontinence per week .
The majority of patients were white ( 94 % ) and female ( 84 % ) , with a mean age of 58 years , range 19 to 93 years .
Thirty - three percent of patients were > 65 years of age .
These characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups .
The study population was inclusive of both naïve patients who had not received prior pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder ( 60 % ) and those who had ( 40 % ) .
Table 2 shows the efficacy data collected from 7 - or 14 - day voiding diaries in the three fixed - dose placebo - controlled studies of 1 , 059 patients treated with placebo , 7 . 5 mg or 15 mg once - daily ENABLEX for 12 weeks .
A significant decrease in the primary endpoint , change from baseline in average weekly urge urinary incontinence episodes was observed in all three studies .
Data is also shown for two secondary endpoints , change from baseline in the average number of micturitions per day ( urinary frequency ) and change from baseline in the average volume voided per micturition .

Further , these effects were sustained throughout the 12 - week treatment period .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] INDICATIONS AND USAGE ENABLEX ® ( darifenacin ) extended - release tablets are indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence , urgency and frequency .
CONTRAINDICATIONS ENABLEX ® ( darifenacin ) extended - release tabletsare contraindicated in patients with urinary retention , gastric retention or uncontrolled narrow - angle glaucoma and in patients who are at risk for these conditions .
ENABLEX is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients .
PRECAUTIONS General Risk of Urinary Retention ENABLEX ® ( darifenacin ) extended - release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention .
Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility ENABLEX should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention .
ENABLEX , like other anticholinergic drugs , may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as severe constipation , ulcerative colitis , and myasthenia gravis .
Controlled Narrow - Angle Glaucoma ENABLEX should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow - angle glaucoma and only where the potential benefits outweigh the risks .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment There are no dosing adjustments for patients with mild hepatic impairment .
The daily dose of ENABLEX should not exceed 7 . 5 mg for patients with moderate hepatic impairment .
ENABLEX has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore is not recommended for use in this patient population ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Information for Patients Patients should be informed that anticholinergic agents , such as ENABLEX , may produce clinically significant adverse effects related to anticholinergic pharmacological activity including constipation , urinary retention and blurred vision .
Heat prostration ( due to decreased sweating ) can occur when anticholinergics such as ENABLEX are used in a hot environment .
Because anticholinergics , such as ENABLEX , may produce dizziness or blurred vision , patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until the drug ’ s effects have been determined .
Patients should read the patient information leaflet before starting therapy with ENABLEX .
ENABLEX extended - release tablets should be taken once daily with liquid .
They may be taken with or without food , and should be swallowed whole and not chewed , divided or crushed .
Drug Interactions The daily dose of ENABLEX should not exceed 7 . 5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir , nelfinavir , clarithromycin and nefazadone ) ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Caution should be taken when ENABLEX is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window , such as flecainide , thioridazine and tricyclic antidepressants ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) .
The concomitant use of ENABLEX with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and / or severity of dry mouth , constipation , blurred vision and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects .
Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to effects on gastrointestinal motility .
Drug Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between darifenacin and laboratory tests have not been studied .
Carcinogenesis / Mutagenesis / Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with darifenacin were conducted in mice and rats .
No evidence of drug - related carcinogenicity was revealed in a 24 - month study in mice at dietary doses up to 100 mg / kg / day or approximately 32 times the estimated human - free AUC0 - 24 h reached with 15 mg , the maximum recommended human dose ( AUC at MRHD ) and in a 24 - month study in rats at doses up to 15 mg / kg / day or up to approximately 12 times the AUC at MRHD in female rats and approximately eight times the AUC at MRHD in male rats .
Darifenacin was not mutagenic in the bacterial mutation assays ( Ames test ) and the Chinese hamster ovary assay , and not clastogenic in the human lymphocyte assay , and the in vivomouse bone marrow cytogenetics assay .
There was no evidence for effects on fertility in male or female rats treated at oral doses up to 50 mg / kg / day .
Exposures in this study correspond to approximately 78 times the AUC at MRHD .
Pregnancy Category C Darifenacin was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses up to 50 and 30 mg / kg / day , respectively .
At the dose of 50 mg / kg in rats , there was a delay in the ossification of the sacral and caudal vertebrae which was not observed at 10 mg / kg ( approximately 13 times the AUC of free plasma concentration at MRHD ) .
Exposure in this study at 50 mg / kg corresponds to approximately 59 times the AUC of free plasma concentration at MRHD .
Dystocia was observed in dams at 10 mg / kg / day ( 17 times the AUC of free plasma concentration at MRHD ) .
Slight developmental delays were observed in pups at this dose .
At 3 mg / kg / day ( five times the AUC of free plasma concentration at MRHD ) there were no effects on dams or pups .
At the dose of 30 mg / kg in rabbits , darifenacin was shown to increase postimplantation loss but not at 10 mg / kg ( nine times the AUC of free plasma concentration at MRHD ) .
Exposure to unbound drug at 30 mg / kg in this study corresponds to approximately 28 times the AUC at MRHD .
In rabbits , dilated ureter and / or kidney pelvis was observed in offspring at 30 mg / kg / day and one case was observed at 10 mg / kg / day along with urinary bladder dilation consistent with pharmacological action of darifenacin .
No effect was observed at 3 mg / kg / day ( 2 . 8 times the AUC of free plasma concentration at MRHD ) .
There are no studies of darifenacin in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , ENABLEX should be used during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers Darifenacin is excreted into the milk of rats .
It is not known whether darifenacin is excreted into human milk and therefore caution should be exercised before ENABLEX is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ENABLEX in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use In the Phase III fixed - dose , placebo - controlled , clinical studies , 30 % of patients treated with ENABLEX were over 65 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients ( n = 207 ) and younger patients < 65 years ( n = 464 ) .
No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations and CLINICAL STUDIES ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS During the clinical development of ENABLEX ® ( darifenacin ) extended - release tablets , a total of 7 , 363 patients and volunteers were treated with doses of darifenacin from 3 . 75 mg to 75 mg once daily .
The safety of ENABLEX was evaluated in Phase II and III controlled clinical trials in a total of 8 , 830 patients , 6 , 001 of whom were treated with ENABLEX .
Of this total , 1 , 069 patients participated in three , 12 - week , Phase III , fixed - dose efficacy and safety studies .
Of this total , 337 and 334 patients received ENABLEX 7 . 5 mg daily and 15 mg daily , respectively .
In all long - term trials combined , 1 , 216 and 672 patients received treatment with ENABLEX for at least 24 and 52 weeks , respectively .
In all placebo - controlled trials combined , the incidence of serious adverse events for 7 . 5 mg , 15 mg and placebo was similar .
In all fixed - dose Phase III studies combined , 3 . 3 % of patients treated with ENABLEX discontinued due to all adverse events versus 2 . 6 % in placebo .
Dry mouth leading to study discontinuation occurred in 0 % , 0 . 9 % , and 0 % of patients treated with ENABLEX 7 . 5 mg daily , ENABLEX 15 mg daily and placebo , respectively .
Constipation leading to study discontinuation occurred in 0 . 6 % , 1 . 2 % , and 0 . 3 % of patients treated with ENABLEX 7 . 5 mg daily , ENABLEX 15 mg daily and placebo , respectively .
