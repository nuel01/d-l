Description Flor - Opal ® is a unique , sustained - release , 0 . 5 % fluoride ion in a sticky , viscous gel to be used with a custom tray .
Flor - Opal is a clear , nearly tasteless , high - viscosity sticky gel with a pH of ~ 6 . 5 .

Procedure • 1 .
Read and understand instructions before using or dispensing to patients .
• 2 .
Fabricate tray to meet patient ' s needs .
See laboratory instructions ( page 2 ) or send the working cast / model and prescription order form to Ultradent .
Areas of sensitivity should be indicated on the cast before sending the model .
If patient already has a custom bleaching tray , instruct them to apply Flor - Opal in the same manner as the bleaching gel .
Note : Trays made only for Flor - Opal may be constructed without scalloping ; however , one should scallop trays made for Opalescence ® bleaching .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • 3 . Flor - Opal is dispensed in 1 . 2 ml unit dose syringes .
An application of a complete arch should use most of the contents of one unit dose syringe .
Tray is loaded by running gel on underside of occlusal and incisal areas .
• 4 .
The length and number of times the tray is worn depends on the condition , the patient , and the clinician .
Recommended treatment times generally range from 2 to 8 hours .
Wearing the tray at night may be suggested since the gel generally stays active in the tray 8 - 10 hours because of slower muscle and salivary activity at night .
Gel usually lasts 4 - 6 hours with daytime activity .
• 5 .
Tray should be removed at meal times .
Following tray removal , patient should brush and rinse with water .
DO NOT swallow solution during rinsing .
Wash tray and store in a tray storage case .
Fresh gel should be used for each application .
• 6 .
Gel may be warmed before placing in tray to avoid thermal sensitivity .
