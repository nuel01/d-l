( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Peripheral Neuropathy POLIVY can cause peripheral neuropathy , including severe cases .
Peripheral neuropathy occurs as early as the first cycle of treatment and is a cumulative effect [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
POLIVY may exacerbate pre - existing peripheral neuropathy .
In Study GO29365 , of 173 patients treated with POLIVY , 40 % reported new or worsening peripheral neuropathy , with a median time to onset of 2 . 1 months .
The peripheral neuropathy was Grade 1 in 26 % of cases , Grade 2 in 12 % , and Grade 3 in 2 . 3 % .
Peripheral neuropathy resulted in POLIVY dose reduction in 2 . 9 % of treated patients , dose delay in 1 . 2 % , and permanent discontinuation in 2 . 9 % .
Sixty - five percent of patients reported improvement or resolution of peripheral neuropathy after a median of 1 month , and 48 % reported complete resolution .
The peripheral neuropathy is predominantly sensory ; however , motor and sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy also occur .
Monitor for symptoms of peripheral neuropathy such as hypoesthesia , hyperesthesia , paresthesia , dysesthesia , neuropathic pain , burning sensation , weakness , or gait disturbance .
Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy may require a delay , dose reduction , or discontinuation of POLIVY [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Infusion - Related Reactions POLIVY can cause infusion - related reactions , including severe cases .
Delayed infusion - related reactions as late as 24 hours after receiving POLIVY have occurred .
With premedication , 7 % of patients ( 12 / 173 ) in Study GO29365 reported infusion - related reactions after the administration of POLIVY .
The reactions were Grade 1 in 67 % , Grade 2 in 25 % , and Grade 3 in 8 % .
Symptoms included fever , chills , flushing , dyspnea , hypotension , and urticaria .
Administer an antihistamine and antipyretic prior to the administration of POLIVY , and monitor patients closely throughout the infusion .
If an infusion - related reaction occurs , interrupt the infusion and institute appropriate medical management [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 3 Myelosuppression Treatment with POLIVY can cause serious or severe myelosuppression , including neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , and anemia .
In patients treated with POLIVY plus BR ( n = 45 ) , 42 % received primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony - stimulating factor .
Grade 3 or higher hematologic adverse reactions included neutropenia ( 42 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 40 % ) , anemia ( 24 % ) , lymphopenia ( 13 % ) , and febrile neutropenia ( 11 % ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Grade 4 hematologic adverse reactions included neutropenia ( 24 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 16 % ) , lymphopenia ( 9 % ) , and febrile neutropenia ( 4 . 4 % ) .
Cytopenias were the most common reason for treatment discontinuation ( 18 % of all patients ) .
Monitor complete blood counts throughout treatment .
Cytopenias may require a delay , dose reduction , or discontinuation of POLIVY [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Consider prophylactic granulocyte colony - stimulating factor administration .
5 . 4 Serious and Opportunistic Infections Fatal and / or serious infections , including opportunistic infections such as sepsis , pneumonia ( including Pneumocystis jiroveci and other fungal pneumonia ) , herpesvirus infection , and cytomegalovirus infection have occurred in patients treated with POLIVY [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 32 % ( 55 / 173 ) of patients treated with POLIVY .
Infection - related deaths were reported in 2 . 9 % of patients within 90 days of last treatment .
Closely monitor patients during treatment for signs of infection .
Administer prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and herpesvirus .
5 . 5 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) PML has been reported after treatment with POLIVY ( 0 . 6 % , 1 / 173 ) .
Monitor for new or worsening neurological , cognitive , or behavioral changes .
Hold POLIVY and any concomitant chemotherapy if PML is suspected , and permanently discontinue if the diagnosis is confirmed .
5 . 6 Tumor Lysis Syndrome POLIVY may cause tumor lysis syndrome .
Patients with high tumor burden and rapidly proliferative tumor may be at increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome .
Monitor closely and take appropriate measures , including tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis .
5 . 7 Hepatotoxicity Serious cases of hepatotoxicity that were consistent with hepatocellular injury , including elevations of transaminases and / or bilirubin , have occurred in patients treated with POLIVY .
In recipients of POLIVY in Study GO29365 ( n = 173 ) , Grade 3 and 4 transaminase elevations developed in 1 . 9 % and 1 . 9 % , respectively .
Laboratory values suggestive of drug - induced liver injury ( both an ALT or AST greater than 3 times upper limit of normal [ ULN ] and total bilirubin greater than 2 times ULN ) occurred in 2 . 3 % of patients .
Preexisting liver disease , elevated baseline liver enzymes , and concomitant medications may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity .
Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin level .
5 . 8 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings from animal studies , POLIVY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
The small molecule component of POLIVY , MMAE , administered to rats caused adverse developmental outcomes , including embryo - fetal mortality and structural abnormalities , at exposures below those occurring clinically at the recommended dose .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with POLIVY and for at least 3 months after the last dose .
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with POLIVY and for at least 5 months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .

Patients treated with POLIVY plus BR received a median of 5 cycles , with 49 % receiving 6 cycles .
Patients treated with BR alone received a median of 3 cycles , with 23 % receiving 6 cycles .
Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 7 % of recipients of POLIVY plus BR within 90 days of last treatment .
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 64 % , most often from infection .
Serious adverse reactions in ≥ 5 % of recipients of POLIVY plus BR included pneumonia ( 16 % ) , febrile neutropenia ( 11 % ) , pyrexia ( 9 % ) , and sepsis ( 7 % ) .
In recipients of POLIVY plus BR , adverse reactions led to dose reduction in 18 % , dose interruption in 51 % , and permanent discontinuation of all treatment in 31 % .
The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and / or neutropenia .

Other clinically relevant adverse reactions ( < 20 % any grade ) included : • General disorders : infusion - related reaction ( 7 % ) • Infection : upper respiratory tract infection ( 16 % ) , lower respiratory tract infection ( 10 % ) , herpesvirus infection ( 12 % ) , cytomegalovirus infection ( 1 . 2 % ) • Respiratory : dyspnea ( 19 % ) , pneumonitis ( 1 . 7 % ) • Nervous system disorders : dizziness ( 10 % ) • Investigations : weight decrease ( 10 % ) , transaminase elevation ( 8 % ) , lipase increase ( 3 . 5 % ) • Musculoskeletal disorders : arthralgia ( 7 % ) • Eye disorders : blurred vision ( 1 . 2 % ) 6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to polatuzumab vedotin - piiq in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
Across all arms of Study GO29365 , 8 / 134 ( 6 % ) patients tested positive for antibodies against polatuzumab vedotin - piiq at one or more post - baseline time points .
Across clinical trials , 14 / 536 ( 2 . 6 % ) evaluable POLIVY - treated patients tested positive for such antibodies at one or more post - baseline time points .
Due to the limited number of patients with antibodies against polatuzumab vedotin - piiq , no conclusions can be drawn concerning a potential effect of immunogenicity on efficacy or safety .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers has the potential to affect the exposure to unconjugated monomethyl auristatin E ( MMAE ) .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on POLIVY Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase unconjugated MMAE AUC [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may increase POLIVY toxicities .
Monitor patients for signs of toxicity .
Strong CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may decrease unconjugated MMAE AUC [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Hepatic impairment has the potential to increase exposure to MMAE .
Monitor patients for adverse reactions .
( 8 . 6 ) • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , POLIVY can cause fetal harm .
There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug - associated risk .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of the small molecule component of POLIVY , MMAE , to pregnant rats during organogenesis at exposures below the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 1 . 8 mg / kg POLIVY every 21 days resulted in embryo - fetal mortality and structural abnormalities ( see Data ) .
Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risks to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4 % and 15 – 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data No embryo - fetal development studies in animals have been performed with polatuzumab vedotin - piiq .
In an embryo - fetal developmental study in pregnant rats , administration of two intravenous doses of MMAE , the small molecule component of POLIVY , on gestational days 6 and 13 caused embryo - fetal mortality and structural abnormalities , including protruding tongue , malrotated limbs , gastroschisis , and agnathia compared to controls at a dose of 0 . 2 mg / kg ( approximately 0 . 5 - fold the human area under the curve [ AUC ] at the recommended dose ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of polatuzumab vedotin - piiq in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with POLIVY and for at least 2 months after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating POLIVY [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Females POLIVY can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with POLIVY and for 3 months after the final dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Males Based on genotoxicity findings , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with POLIVY and for at least 5 months after the final dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicity ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Based on findings from animal studies , POLIVY may impair male fertility .
The reversibility of this effect is unknown [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of POLIVY have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Among 173 patients treated with POLIVY in Study GO29365 , 95 ( 55 % ) were ≥ 65 years of age .
Patients aged ≥ 65 had a numerically higher incidence of serious adverse reactions ( 64 % ) than patients aged < 65 ( 53 % ) .
Clinical studies of POLIVY did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged ≥ 65 to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Avoid the administration of POLIVY in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( bilirubin greater than 1 . 5 × ULN ) .
Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment are likely to have increased exposure to MMAE , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions .
POLIVY has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
No adjustment in the starting dose is required when administering POLIVY to patients with mild hepatic impairment ( bilirubin greater than ULN to less than or equal to 1 . 5 × ULN or AST greater than ULN ) .
11 DESCRIPTION Polatuzumab vedotin - piiq is a CD79b - directed antibody - drug conjugate ( ADC ) consisting of three components : 1 ) the humanized immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibody specific for human CD79b ; 2 ) the small molecule anti - mitotic agent MMAE ; and 3 ) a protease - cleavable linker maleimidocaproyl - valine - citrulline - p - aminobenzyloxycarbonyl ( mc - vc - PAB ) that covalently attaches MMAE to the polatuzumab antibody .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Polatuzumab vedotin - piiq has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa .
An average of 3 . 5 molecules of MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule .
Polatuzumab vedotin - piiq is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components .
The antibody is produced by mammalian ( Chinese hamster ovary ) cells , and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Polatuzumab vedotin - piiq is a CD79b - directed antibody - drug conjugate with activity against dividing B cells .
The small molecule , MMAE , is an anti - mitotic agent covalently attached to the antibody via a cleavable linker .
The monoclonal antibody binds to CD79b , a B - cell specific surface protein , which is a component of the B - cell receptor .
Upon binding CD79b , polatuzumab vedotin - piiq is internalized , and the linker is cleaved by lysosomal proteases to enable intracellular delivery of MMAE .
MMAE binds to microtubules and kills dividing cells by inhibiting cell division and inducing apoptosis .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Over polatuzumab vedotin - piiq dosages of 0 . 1 to 2 . 4 mg / kg ( 0 . 06 to 1 . 33 times the approved recommended dosage ) , a higher exposure was associated with higher incidence of some adverse reactions ( e . g . , ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy , ≥ Grade 3 anemia ) and a lower exposure was associated with lower efficacy .
Cardiac Electrophysiology Polatuzumab vedotin - piiq did not prolong the mean QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent based on ECG data from two open - label studies in patients with previously treated B - cell malignancies at the recommended dosage .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The exposure parameters of antibody - conjugated MMAE ( acMMAE ) and unconjugated MMAE ( the cytotoxic component of polatuzumab vedotin - piiq ) are summarized in Table 7 .
The plasma exposure of acMMAE and unconjugated MMAE increased proportionally over a polatuzumab vedotin - piiq dose range from 0 . 1 to 2 . 4 mg / kg ( 0 . 06 to 1 . 33 times the approved recommended dosage ) .
Cycle 3 acMMAE AUC were predicted to increase by approximately 30 % over Cycle 1 AUC , and achieved more than 90 % of the Cycle 6 AUC .
Unconjugated MMAE plasma exposures were < 3 % of acMMAE exposures , and the AUC and Cmax were predicted to decrease after repeated every - 3 - week dosing .
Table 7 Exposure Parameters of acMMAE and Unconjugated MMAE [ 1 ] acMMAE Mean ( ± SD ) Unconjugated MMAE Mean ( ± SD ) Cmax = maximum concentration , AUCinf = area under the concentration - time curve from time zero to infinity .
Cmax ( ng / mL ) 803 ( ± 233 ) 6 . 82 ( ± 4 . 73 ) AUCinf ( day * ng / mL ) 1860 ( ± 966 ) 52 . 3 ( ± 18 . 0 ) [ 1 ] After the first polatuzumab vedotin - piiq dose of 1 . 8 mg / kg .
Distribution The acMMAE central volume of distribution estimated based on population PK analysis is 3 . 15 L . For humans , MMAE plasma protein binding is 71 % to 77 % and the blood - to - plasma ratio is 0 . 79 to 0 . 98 , in vitro .
Elimination The acMMAE terminal half - life is approximately 12 days ( 95 % CI : 8 . 1 to 19 . 5 days ) at Cycle 6 with predicted clearance of 0 . 9 L / day .
The unconjugated MMAE terminal half - life is approximately 4 days after the first polatuzumab vedotin - piiq dose .
Metabolism Polatuzumab vedotin - piiq catabolism has not been studied in humans ; however , it is expected to undergo catabolism to small peptides , amino acids , unconjugated MMAE , and unconjugated MMAE - related catabolites .
MMAE is a substrate for CYP3A4 .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of polatuzumab vedotin - piiq were observed based on age ( 20 to 89 years ) , sex , or race / ethnicity ( Asian and non - Asian ) .
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of acMMAE or unconjugated MMAE were observed based on mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 to 89 mL / min ) .
In mild hepatic impairment ( AST or ALT > 1 . 0 to 2 . 5 × ULN or total bilirubin > 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 × ULN ) , there was a 40 % increase in MMAE exposure , which was not deemed clinically significant .
The effect of severe renal impairment ( CLcr 15 to 29 mL / min ) , end - stage renal disease with or without dialysis , moderate to severe hepatic impairment ( AST or ALT > 2 . 5 × ULN or total bilirubin > 1 . 5 × ULN ) , or liver transplantation on the pharmacokinetics of acMMAE or unconjugated MMAE is unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies No dedicated clinical drug - drug interaction studies with POLIVY in humans have been conducted .
Physiologically - Based Pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) Modeling Predictions : Strong CYP3A Inhibitor : Concomitant use of polatuzumab vedotin - piiq with ketoconazole ( strong CYP3A inhibitor ) is predicted to increase unconjugated MMAE AUC by 45 % .
Strong CYP3A Inducer : Concomitant use of polatuzumab vedotin - piiq with rifampin ( strong CYP3A inducer ) is predicted to decrease unconjugated MMAE AUC by 63 % .
Sensitive CYP3A Substrate : Concomitant use of polatuzumab vedotin - piiq is predicted not to affect exposure to midazolam ( sensitive CYP3A substrate ) .
Population Pharmacokinetic ( popPK ) Modeling Predictions : Bendamustine or Rituximab : No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of acMMAE or unconjugated MMAE when polatuzumab vedotin - piiq is used concomitantly with bendamustine or rituximab .
In Vitro Studies Where Drug Interaction Potential Was Not Further Evaluated Clinically : Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) Enzymes : MMAE does not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP2D6 .
MMAE does not induce major CYP enzymes .
Transporter Systems : MMAE does not inhibit P - gp .
MMAE is a P - gp substrate .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies in animals have not been performed with polatuzumab vedotin - piiq or MMAE .
MMAE was positive for genotoxicity in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus study through an aneugenic mechanism .
MMAE was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay or the L5178Y mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay .
Fertility studies in animals have not been performed with polatuzumab vedotin - piiq or MMAE .
However , results of repeat - dose toxicity in rats indicate the potential for polatuzumab vedotin - piiq to impair male fertility .
In the 4 - week repeat - dose toxicity study in rats with weekly dosing of 2 , 6 , and 10 mg / kg , dose - dependent testicular seminiferous tubule degeneration with abnormal lumen contents in the epididymis was observed .
Findings in the testes and epididymis did not reverse and correlated with decreased testes weight and gross findings of small and / or soft testes at recovery necropsy in males given doses ≥ 2 mg / kg ( below the exposure at the recommended dose based on unconjugated MMAE AUC ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B - cell Lymphoma The efficacy of POLIVY was evaluated in Study GO29365 ( NCT02257567 ) , an open - label , multicenter clinical trial that included a cohort of 80 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL after at least one prior regimen .
Patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either POLIVY in combination with bendamustine and a rituximab product ( BR ) or BR alone for six 21 - day cycles .
Randomization was stratified by duration of response ( DOR ) to last therapy .
Eligible patients were not candidates for autologous HSCT at study entry .
The study excluded patients with Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy , prior allogeneic HSCT , active central nervous system lymphoma , or transformed lymphoma .
Following premedication with an antihistamine and antipyretic , POLIVY was given by intravenous infusion at 1 . 8 mg / kg on Day 2 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 – 6 .
Bendamustine was administered at 90 mg / m2 intravenously daily on Days 2 and 3 of Cycle 1 and on Days 1 and 2 of Cycles 2 – 6 .
A rituximab product was administered at a dose of 375 mg / m2 intravenously on Day 1 of Cycles 1 – 6 .
The cycle length was 21 days .
Of the 80 patients randomized to receive POLIVY plus BR ( n = 40 ) or BR alone ( n = 40 ) , the median age was 69 years ( range : 30 – 86 years ) , 66 % were male , and 71 % were white .
Most patients ( 98 % ) had DLBCL not otherwise specified .
The primary reasons patients were not candidates for HSCT included age ( 40 % ) , insufficient response to salvage therapy ( 26 % ) , and prior transplant failure ( 20 % ) .
The median number of prior therapies was 2 ( range : 1 – 7 ) , with 29 % receiving one prior therapy , 25 % receiving 2 prior therapies , and 46 % receiving 3 or more prior therapies .
Eighty percent of patients had refractory disease to last therapy .
In the POLIVY plus BR arm , patients received a median of 5 cycles , with 49 % receiving 6 cycles .
In the BR arm , patients received a median of 3 cycles , with 23 % receiving 6 cycles .
Efficacy was based on complete response ( CR ) rate at the end of treatment and DOR , as determined by an independent review committee ( IRC ) .
Other efficacy measures included IRC - assessed best overall response .
Response rates are summarized in Table 8 .
