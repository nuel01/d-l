Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure : Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : Thrombotic microangiopathy Endocrine Disorders : Hyperthyroidism Gastrointestinal Disorders : Gastrointestinal perforation , fistula Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : Dehydration Nervous System Disorders : Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome ( RPLS ) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Severe cutaneous reaction ( e . g . , Erythema multiforme , Stevens - Johnson syndrome ) , impaired wound healing Vascular Disorders : Arterial ( including aortic ) aneurysms , dissections , and rupture 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Avoid coadministration or reduce Iclusig dose if coadministration cannot be avoided .
( 2 . 3 , 7 . 1 ) • Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid coadministration .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on Iclusig Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of Iclusig with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increases ponatinib plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may increase the risk of Iclusig adverse reactions .
Avoid coadministration of Iclusig with strong CYP3A inhibitors .
If coadministration of Iclusig with strong CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided , reduce the Iclusig dosage [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Strong CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of Iclusig with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases ponatinib plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Avoid coadministration of Iclusig with strong CYP3A inducers unless the benefit outweighs the risk of decreased ponatinib exposure .
Monitor patients for reduced efficacy .
Selection of concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A induction potential is recommended .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , Iclusig can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available data on Iclusig use in pregnant women .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of ponatinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at doses lower than human exposures at the recommended human dose ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data Ponatinib was studied for effects on embryo - fetal development in pregnant rats given oral doses of 0 . 3 mg / kg / day , 1 mg / kg / day , and 3 mg / kg / day during organogenesis ( 25 rats per group ) .
At the maternally toxic dose of 3 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose of 45 mg / day ) , ponatinib caused embryo - fetal toxicity as shown by increased resorptions , reduced body weight , external alterations , multiple soft tissue and skeletal alterations , and reduced ossification .
Embryo - fetal toxicities also were observed at 1 mg / kg / day ( approximately 24 % the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose ) and involved multiple fetal soft tissue and skeletal alterations , including reduced ossification .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data on the presence of ponatinib in human milk or the effects on the breastfed child or on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child from ponatinib , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Iclusig and for 6 days following the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Iclusig can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Iclusig .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Iclusig and for 3 weeks after the last dose .
Infertility Based on animal data , ponatinib may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential .
It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data A juvenile toxicity study in 15 day old rats was conducted with daily oral gavage administration of ponatinib at 0 . 75 mg / kg / day , 1 . 5 mg / kg / day , or 3 mg / kg / day for 21 days .
There were no adverse effects of ponatinib on juvenile rat developmental parameters ( vaginal opening , preputial separation or bone measurements ) observed in this study .
Once daily oral administration of 3 mg / kg / day ponatinib to juvenile rats beginning on Day 15 postpartum ( pp ) resulted in mortality related to inflammatory effects after 6 to 7 days following initiation of treatment .
The dose of 3 mg / kg / day is approximately 0 . 32 times the clinical dose on a mg / m2 basis for a child .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 94 patients with CP - CML who received Iclusig at a starting dose of 45 mg in OPTIC , 17 % were 65 years and older and 2 . 1 % were 75 years and older .
Patients aged 65 years and older had a lower ≤ 1 % BCR - ABL1IS rate at 12 months ( 27 % ) as compared with patients less than 65 years of age ( 47 % ) .
AOEs occurred in 38 % ( 6 / 16 ) of patients 65 years and older and 9 % ( 7 / 78 ) of patients less than 65 years of age [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Of the 449 patients who received Iclusig in PACE , 35 % were 65 years and older and 8 % were 75 years and older .
In patients with CP - CML , patients aged 65 years and older had a lower major cytogenetic response rate ( 40 % ) as compared with patients less than 65 years of age ( 65 % ) .
In patients with AP - CML , BP - CML , and Ph + ALL , patients aged 65 years and older had a similar hematologic response rate ( 45 % ) as compared with patients less than 65 years of age ( 44 % ) .
AOEs occurred in 35 % ( 54 / 155 ) of patients 65 years and older and in 21 % ( 61 / 294 ) of patients less than 65 years of age [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Patients aged 65 years or older are more likely to experience adverse reactions including vascular occlusion , decreased platelet count , peripheral edema , increased lipase , dyspnea , asthenia , muscle spasms , and decreased appetite .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment are more likely to experience adverse reactions compared to patients with normal hepatic function .
Reduce the starting dose of Iclusig for patients with pre - existing hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh A , B , or C ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The safety of multiple doses , or doses higher than 30 mg , has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdoses with Iclusig were reported in clinical trials .
One patient was estimated to have been administered 540 mg via nasogastric tube .
Two hours after the overdosage , the patient had an uncorrected QT interval of 520 ms . Subsequent ECGs showed normal sinus rhythm with uncorrected QT intervals of 480 ms and 400 ms . The patient died 9 days after the overdosage from pneumonia and sepsis .
Another patient self - administered 165 mg on Cycle 1 Day 2 .
The patient experienced fatigue and non - cardiac chest pain on Day 3 .
Multiple doses of 90 mg per day for 12 days in a patient resulted in pneumonia , systemic inflammatory response , atrial fibrillation , and a moderate pericardial effusion .
In the event of an overdosage , stop Iclusig , observe the patient and provide supportive treatment as appropriate .
11 DESCRIPTION Ponatinib is a kinase inhibitor .
The chemical name for ponatinib hydrochloride is 3 - ( imidazo [ 1 , 2 - b ] pyridazin - 3 - ylethynyl ) - 4 - methyl - N - { 4 - [ ( 4 - methylpiperazin - 1 - yl ) methyl ] - 3 - ( trifluoromethyl ) phenyl } benzamide hydrochloride .
The molecular formula is C29H28ClF3N6O which corresponds to a formula weight of 569 . 02 g / mol .
Its structure is shown below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Ponatinib HCl is an off - white to yellow powder with pKa of 2 . 77 and 7 . 8 .
The solubility of ponatinib in pH 1 . 7 , 2 . 7 , and 7 . 5 buffers is 7790 mcg / mL , 3 . 44 mcg / mL , and 0 . 16 mcg / mL , respectively , indicating a decrease in solubility with increasing pH . Each tablet for oral administration contains 10 mg , 15 mg , 30 mg or 45 mg of ponatinib equivalent to 10 . 68 mg , 16 . 03 mg , 32 . 05 mg , and 48 . 08 mg of ponatinib hydrochloride with the following inactive ingredients : lactose monohydrate , microcrystalline cellulose , sodium starch glycolate ( type B ) , colloidal silicon dioxide , magnesium stearate and a tablet coating .
The tablet coating consists of talc , polyethylene glycol , polyvinyl alcohol , and titanium dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ponatinib is a kinase inhibitor .
Ponatinib inhibited the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity of ABL and T315I mutant ABL with IC50 concentrations of 0 . 4 nM and 2 . 0 nM , respectively .
Ponatinib inhibited the in vitro activity of additional kinases with IC50 concentrations between 0 . 1 nM and 20 nM , including members of the VEGFR , PDGFR , FGFR , EPH receptors and SRC families of kinases , and KIT , RET , TIE2 , and FLT3 .
Ponatinib inhibited the in vitro viability of cells expressing native or mutant BCR - ABL , including T315I .
In mice , treatment with ponatinib reduced the size of tumors expressing native or T315I mutant BCR - ABL when compared to controls .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In PACE , the dose intensity - safety relationship indicated that there are significant increases in Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions ( hypertension , thrombocytopenia , pancreatitis , neutropenia , rash , ALT increase , AST increase , lipase increase , myelosuppression ) over the dose range of 15 mg to 45 mg .
In addition to dose , increased age and history of ischemia , hypertension , diabetes , or hypercholesterolemia were also contributory factors to a higher incidence of AOEs .
In OPTIC , an exposure - response relationship between ponatinib exposure and molecular response rate at 12 months was observed .
A relationship between higher ponatinib exposures and higher incidence of adverse reactions , including thrombocytopenia ( Grade ≥ 3 ) and AOEs , was observed .
In vitro , there was no significant inhibition of platelet aggregation with ponatinib at concentrations seen clinically and up to 0 . 7 mcg / mL ( 1 . 23 μM ) .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The QT interval prolongation potential of Iclusig was assessed in 39 patients with cancer who received Iclusig 30 mg , 45 mg , or 60 mg ( 0 . 67 to 1 . 33 times the approved recommended starting dose ) orally once daily .
No large mean increase ( i . e . , > 20 msec ) in QTc interval was detected .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Ponatinib administered to patients with cancer exhibited approximately dose proportional increases in both steady - state Cmax and AUC over the dose range of 2 mg to 60 mg ( 0 . 04 to 1 . 33 times the approved recommended starting dose ) .
The mean ( CV % ) Cmax and AUC ( 0 - 24 ) of Iclusig 45 mg orally once daily at presumed steady - state in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies were 73 ng / mL ( 74 % ) and 1253 ng ∙ hr / mL ( 73 % ) , respectively .
Exposure increased by approximately 90 % ( median ) [ range : 20 % to 440 % ] between the first dose and presumed steady - state .
Absorption The absolute bioavailability of ponatinib is unknown .
Peak concentrations of ponatinib are observed within 6 hours after Iclusig oral administration .
Effect of Food : Following ingestion of either a high - fat ( approximately 900 to 1000 calories with approximately 150 , 250 , and 500 to 600 calories derived from protein , carbohydrate , and fat , respectively ) or low - fat meal ( approximately 547 calories with approximately 56 , 428 and 63 calories derived from protein , carbohydrate , and fat , respectively ) by 22 healthy volunteers , plasma ponatinib exposures ( AUC and Cmax ) were not different when compared to fasting conditions .
Distribution Ponatinib is greater than 99 % bound to plasma proteins in vitro .
There was no plasma protein binding displacement of ponatinib ( 145 nM ) in vitro by other highly protein bound medications ( ibuprofen , nifedipine , propranolol , salicylic acid , and warfarin ) .
The mean ( CV % ) apparent steady - state volume of distribution is 1 , 223 liters ( 102 % ) following oral administration of Iclusig 45 mg orally once daily for 28 days in patients with cancer .
Elimination The mean ( range ) terminal elimination half - life of ponatinib was approximately 24 ( 12 to 66 ) hours following Iclusig 45 mg orally once daily for 28 days in patients with cancer .
Metabolism At least 64 % of a dose undergoes Phase I and Phase II metabolism .
CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C8 , CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 are involved in the Phase I metabolism of ponatinib in vitro .
Ponatinib is also metabolized by esterases and / or amidases .
Excretion Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled ponatinib , approximately 87 % of the radioactive dose was recovered in the feces and approximately 5 % in the urine .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of ponatinib were observed based on age ( 19 to 85 years ) , body weight ( 41 to 152 kg ) , and mild to moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL / min , estimated by the Cockcroft - Gault equation ) .
Hepatic Impairment A single 30 mg oral dose of Iclusig was administered to subjects with normal hepatic function and to subjects with mild [ Child - Pugh A ] , moderate [ Child - Pugh B ] , and severe [ Child - Pugh C ] hepatic impairment .
Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function , there was no trend of increased ponatinib exposure in subjects with hepatic impairment .
There was an increased incidence of adverse reactions ( e . g . , gastrointestinal disorders , including a case of severe pancreatitis ) in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
Renal Impairment Iclusig has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment .
Although renal excretion is not a major route of ponatinib elimination , the potential for severe renal impairment to affect hepatic elimination has not been determined .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Coadministration of ponatinib with multiple doses of ketoconazole ( strong CYP3A inhibitor ) increased the ponatinib AUC0 - INF by 78 % and Cmax by 47 % .
Strong CYP3A Inducers : Coadministration of ponatinib with multiple doses of rifampin ( strong CYP3A inducer ) decreased the ponatinib AUC0 - INF by 62 % and Cmax by 42 % .
Gastric Acid Reducing Agents : Coadministration of ponatinib with multiple doses of lansoprazole ( proton pump inhibitor ) decreased the ponatinib AUC0 - INF by 6 % and Cmax by 25 % .
In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes : Ponatinib does not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP3A , or CYP2D6 and does not induce CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , or CYP3A .
Transporter Systems : Ponatinib is a weak substrate for both P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) .
Ponatinib is not a substrate for organic anion transporting polypeptides ( OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 ) and organic cation transporter 1 ( OCT1 ) .
Ponatinib inhibits P - gp , BCRP , and bile salt export pump ( BSEP ) .
Ponatinib does not inhibit OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OCT1 , OCT2 , or the organic anion transporters OAT1 and OAT3 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 2 - year carcinogenicity study , male and female rats were administered daily oral doses of ponatinib of 0 . 05 mg / kg / day , 0 . 1 mg / kg / day , 0 . 2 mg / kg / day and 0 . 2 mg / kg / day , 0 . 4 mg / kg / day , and 0 . 8 mg / kg / day , respectively .
Exposures in animals at the highest dose tested were 0 . 3 - to 0 . 8 - fold the human exposure ( based on AUC ) at doses of 15 mg and 45 mg daily .
Ponatinib induced a statistically significant increase in malignant squamous neoplasms of the clitoral gland in females at 0 . 8 mg / kg / day .
Ponatinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenesis ( Ames ) assay , was not clastogenic in a chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes , nor was it clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay at oral doses up to 2000 mg / kg .
Ponatinib may impair female fertility .
In a fertility study in male and female rats , female fertility parameters were reduced at 1 . 5 mg / kg / day with exposure equivalent to 0 . 43 times and 1 . 23 times of human daily steady state AUC at the recommended dose of 45 mg / day ( AUC = 1296 h ∙ ng / mL ) and 15 mg / day ( 451 . 8 h ∙ ng / mL ) , respectively .
Evidence of pre - and post - implantation loss of embryos was observed in female rats .
Although there were no effects on male fertility parameters in the rat fertility study , repeat dose toxicology studies in monkeys showed degeneration of epithelium of the testes in monkeys at exposures approximately 3 . 3 times the plasma drug exposure ( AUC ) in patients receiving the recommended dose of 45 mg / day .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Chronic Phase ( CP ) CML The efficacy of Iclusig was evaluated in OPTIC ( NCT02467270 ) , a dose - optimization trial .
Eligible patients had CP - CML whose disease was considered to be resistant or resistant / intolerant to at least 2 prior kinase inhibitors or who have the T315I mutation .
T315I mutation testing was performed on peripheral blood by Sanger Sequencing of the p190 or p210 BCR - ABL region .
Resistance in CP - CML while on a prior kinase inhibitor was defined as failure to achieve either a complete hematologic response ( by 3 months ) , a minor cytogenetic response ( by 6 months ) , or a major cytogenetic response ( by 12 months ) , or development of a new BCR - ABL1 kinase domain mutation or new clonal evolution .
Patients were required to have > 1 % BCR - ABL1IS ( by real - time polymerase chain reaction ) at trial entry .
Patients received one of three starting dosages : 45 mg orally once daily , 30 mg orally once daily , or 15 mg orally once daily .
Patients who received a starting dose of 45 mg or 30 mg had a dose reduction to 15 mg once daily upon achieving ≤ 1 % BCR - ABL1IS .
The major efficacy outcome measure was ≤ 1 % BCR - ABL1IS at 12 months .
The median duration of follow - up for the 45 mg cohort ( N = 94 ) was 27 . 0 months .
Only the efficacy results for the recommended starting dose of 45 mg are described below .
A total of 282 patients received Iclusig : 94 received a starting dose of 45 mg , 94 received a starting dose of 30 mg , and 94 received a starting dose of 15 mg .

Of these 28 patients , 18 patients ( 64 % ) maintained the response for at least one year .
Median duration of response ( MR2 ) was not reached .
Chronic Phase ( CP ) , Accelerated Phase ( AP ) , Blast Phase ( BP ) CML and Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( Ph + ALL ) The efficacy of Iclusig was evaluated in PACE ( NCT01207440 ) , a single - arm , open - label , international , multicenter trial .
Eligible patients had CML and Ph + ALL whose disease was considered to be resistant or intolerant to a prior kinase inhibitor .
Patients were assigned to one of six cohorts based on disease phase ( CP - CML , AP - CML , or BP - CML / Ph + ALL ) , resistance or intolerance ( R / I ) to prior kinase inhibitors , and the presence of the T315I mutation .
T315I mutation testing was performed on peripheral blood by Sanger Sequencing of the p190 or p210 BCR - ABL region .
Resistance in CP - CML while on a prior kinase inhibitor was defined as failure to achieve either a complete hematologic response ( by 3 months ) , a minor cytogenetic response ( by 6 months ) , or a major cytogenetic response ( by 12 months ) .
Patients with CP - CML who experienced a loss of response or development of a kinase domain mutation in the absence of a complete cytogenetic response or progression to AP - CML or BP - CML at any time on a prior kinase inhibitor were also considered resistant .
Resistance in AP - CML , BP - CML , and Ph + ALL was defined as failure to achieve either a major hematologic response ( by 3 months in AP - CML , and by 1 month in BP - CML and Ph + ALL ) , loss of major hematologic response ( at any time ) , or development of a kinase domain mutation in the absence of a complete major hematologic response while on a prior kinase inhibitor .
Intolerance was defined as the discontinuation of a prior kinase inhibitor due to toxicities despite optimal management in the absence of a complete cytogenetic response in patients with CP - CML or major hematologic response for patients with AP - CML , BP - CML , or Ph + ALL .
Patients were administered a starting dose of Iclusig 45 mg orally once daily .
The major efficacy outcome measure for patients with CP - CML was major cytogenetic response ( MCyR ) , which included complete and partial cytogenetic responses ( CCyR and PCyR ) .
The major efficacy outcome measure for patients with AP - CML , BP - CML , and Ph + ALL was major hematologic response ( MaHR ) , defined as either a complete hematologic response ( CHR ) or no evidence of leukemia ( NEL ) .
The trial enrolled 449 patients , of which 444 were eligible for efficacy analysis : 267 patients with CP - CML ( R / I Cohort : N = 203 , T315I : N = 64 ) , 83 patients with AP - CML , 62 patients with BP - CML , and 32 patients with Ph + ALL .
Five patients were not eligible for efficacy analysis due to lack of confirmation of T315I mutation status , and these patients had not received prior dasatinib or nilotinib .
At study completion , the median duration of follow - up for the trial ( all cohorts ) was 40 . 5 months ( range : 0 . 1 months to 79 . 5 months ) .
