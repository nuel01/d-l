Tacrolimus , previously known as FK506 , is the active ingredient in Prograf .
Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis .
Chemically , tacrolimus is designated as [ 3 S - [ 3 R * [ E ( 1 S * , 3 S * , 4 S * ) ] , 4 S * , 5 R * , 8 S * , 9 E , 12 R * , 14 R * , 15 S * , 16 R * , 18 S * , 19 S * , 26 aR * ] ] - 5 , 6 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 26 a - hexadecahydro - 5 , 19 - dihydroxy - 3 - [ 2 - ( 4 - hydroxy - 3 - methoxycyclohexyl ) - 1 - methylethenyl ] - 14 , 16 - dimethoxy - 4 , 10 , 12 , 18 - tetramethyl - 8 - ( 2 - propenyl ) - 15 , 19 - epoxy - 3 H - pyrido [ 2 , 1 - c ] [ 1 , 4 ] oxaazacyclotricosine - 1 , 7 , 20 , 21 ( 4 H , 23 H ) - tetrone , monohydrate .
The chemical structure of tacrolimus is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Tacrolimus has an empirical formula of C44H69NO12 • H2O and a formula weight of 822 . 03 .
Tacrolimus appears as white crystals or crystalline powder .
It is practically insoluble in water , freely soluble in ethanol , and very soluble in methanol and chloroform .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Tacrolimus prolongs the survival of the host and transplanted graft in animal transplant models of liver , kidney , heart , bone marrow , small bowel and pancreas , lung and trachea , skin , cornea , and limb .
In animals , tacrolimus has been demonstrated to suppress some humoral immunity and , to a greater extent , cell - mediated reactions such as allograft rejection , delayed type hypersensitivity , collagen - induced arthritis , experimental allergic encephalomyelitis , and graft versus host disease .
Tacrolimus inhibits T - lymphocyte activation , although the exact mechanism of action is not known .
Experimental evidence suggests that tacrolimus binds to an intracellular protein , FKBP - 12 .
A complex of tacrolimus - FKBP - 12 , calcium , calmodulin , and calcineurin is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin inhibited .
This effect may prevent the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T - cells ( NF - AT ) , a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines ( such as interleukin - 2 , gamma interferon ) .
The net result is the inhibition of T - lymphocyte activation ( i . e . , immunosuppression ) .
Pharmacokinetics Tacrolimus activity is primarily due to the parent drug .
The pharmacokinetic parameters ( mean ± S . D . ) of tacrolimus have been determined following intravenous ( IV ) and / or oral ( PO ) administration in healthy volunteers , and in kidney transplant , liver transplant , and heart transplant patients .

( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Pharmacokinetic data indicate that whole blood concentrations rather than plasma concentrations serve as the more appropriate sampling compartment to describe tacrolimus pharmacokinetics .
Absorption Absorption of tacrolimus from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration is incomplete and variable .
The absolute bioavailability of tacrolimus was 17 ± 10 % in adult kidney transplant patients ( N = 26 ) , 22 ± 6 % in adult liver transplant patients ( N = 17 ) , 23 ± 9 % in adult heart transplant patients ( N = 11 ) and 18 ± 5 % in healthy volunteers ( N = 16 ) .
A single dose study conducted in 32 healthy volunteers established the bioequivalence of the 1 mg and 5 mg capsules .
Another single dose study in 32 healthy volunteers established the bioequivalence of the 0 . 5 mg and 1 mg capsules .
Tacrolimus maximum blood concentrations ( Cmax ) and area under the curve ( AUC ) appeared to increase in a dose - proportional fashion in 18 fasted healthy volunteers receiving a single oral dose of 3 , 7 , and 10 mg .
In 18 kidney transplant patients , tacrolimus trough concentrations from 3 to 30 ng / mL measured at 10 - 12 hours post - dose ( Cmin ) correlated well with the AUC ( correlation coefficient 0 . 93 ) .
In 24 liver transplant patients over a concentration range of 10 to 60 ng / mL , the correlation coefficient was 0 . 94 .
In 25 heart transplant patients over a concentration range of 2 to 24 ng / mL , the correlation coefficient was 0 . 89 after an oral dose of 0 . 075 or 0 . 15 mg / kg / day at steady - state .
Food Effects The rate and extent of tacrolimus absorption were greatest under fasted conditions .
The presence and composition of food decreased both the rate and extent of tacrolimus absorption when administered to 15 healthy volunteers .
The effect was most pronounced with a high - fat meal ( 848 kcal , 46 % fat ) : mean AUC and Cmax were decreased 37 % and 77 % , respectively ; Tmax was lengthened 5 - fold .
A high - carbohydrate meal ( 668 kcal , 85 % carbohydrate ) decreased mean AUC and mean Cmax by 28 % and 65 % , respectively .
In healthy volunteers ( N = 16 ) , the time of the meal also affected tacrolimus bioavailability .
When given immediately following the meal , mean Cmax was reduced 71 % , and mean AUC was reduced 39 % , relative to the fasted condition .
When administered 1 . 5 hours following the meal , mean Cmax was reduced 63 % , and mean AUC was reduced 39 % , relative to the fasted condition .
In 11 liver transplant patients , Prograf administered 15 minutes after a high fat ( 400 kcal , 34 % fat ) breakfast , resulted in decreased AUC ( 27 ± 18 % ) and Cmax ( 50 ± 19 % ) , as compared to a fasted state .
Distribution The plasma protein binding of tacrolimus is approximately 99 % and is independent of concentration over a range of 5 - 50 ng / mL .
Tacrolimus is bound mainly to albumin and alpha - 1 - acid glycoprotein , and has a high level of association with erythrocytes .
The distribution of tacrolimus between whole blood and plasma depends on several factors , such as hematocrit , temperature at the time of plasma separation , drug concentration , and plasma protein concentration .
In a U . S . study , the ratio of whole blood concentration to plasma concentration averaged 35 ( range 12 to 67 ) .
Metabolism Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by the mixed - function oxidase system , primarily the cytochrome P - 450 system ( CYP3A ) .
A metabolic pathway leading to the formation of 8 possible metabolites has been proposed .
Demethylation and hydroxylation were identified as the primary mechanisms of biotransformation in vitro .
The major metabolite identified in incubations with human liver microsomes is 13 - demethyl tacrolimus .
In in vitro studies , a 31 - demethyl metabolite has been reported to have the same activity as tacrolimus .
Excretion The mean clearance following IV administration of tacrolimus is 0 . 040 , 0 . 083 , and 0 . 053 , and 0 . 051 L / hr / kg in healthy volunteers , adult kidney transplant patients , adult liver transplant patients , and adult heart transplant patients , respectively .
In man , less than 1 % of the dose administered is excreted unchanged in urine .
In a mass balance study of IV administered radiolabeled tacrolimus to 6 healthy volunteers , the mean recovery of radiolabel was 77 . 8 ± 12 . 7 % .
Fecal elimination accounted for 92 . 4 ± 1 . 0 % and the elimination half - life based on radioactivity was 48 . 1 ± 15 . 9 hours whereas it was 43 . 5 ± 11 . 6 hours based on tacrolimus concentrations .
The mean clearance of radiolabel was 0 . 029 ± 0 . 015 L / hr / kg and clearance of tacrolimus was 0 . 029 ± 0 . 009 L / hr / kg .
When administered PO , the mean recovery of the radiolabel was 94 . 9 ± 30 . 7 % .
Fecal elimination accounted for 92 . 6 ± 30 . 7 % , urinary elimination accounted for 2 . 3 ± 1 . 1 % and the elimination half - life based on radioactivity was 31 . 9 ± 10 . 5 hours whereas it was 48 . 4 ± 12 . 3 hours based on tacrolimus concentrations .
The mean clearance of radiolabel was 0 . 226 ± 0 . 116 L / hr / kg and clearance of tacrolimus 0 . 172 ± 0 . 088 L / hr / kg .
Special Populations Pediatric Pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus have been studied in liver transplantation patients , 0 . 7 to 13 . 2 years of age .
Following IV administration of a 0 . 037 mg / kg / day dose to 12 pediatric patients , mean terminal half - life , volume of distribution and clearance were 11 . 5 ± 3 . 8 hours , 2 . 6 ± 2 . 1 L / kg and 0 . 138 ± 0 . 071 L / hr / kg , respectively .
Following oral administration to 9 patients , mean AUC and Cmax were 337 ± 167 ng · hr / mL and 48 . 4 ± 27 . 9 ng / mL , respectively .
The absolute bioavailability was 31 ± 24 % .
Whole blood trough concentrations from 31 patients less than 12 years old showed that pediatric patients needed higher doses than adults to achieve similar tacrolimus trough concentrations .

The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained were similar for both groups .
The mean clearance of tacrolimus in patients with renal dysfunction was similar to that in normal volunteers ( see previous table ) .
Hepatic Insufficiency : Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics have been determined in six patients with mild hepatic dysfunction ( mean Pugh score : 6 . 2 ) following single IV and oral administrations .
The mean clearance of tacrolimus in patients with mild hepatic dysfunction was not substantially different from that in normal volunteers ( see previous table ) .
Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics were studied in 6 patients with severe hepatic dysfunction ( mean Pugh score : > 10 ) .
The mean clearance was substantially lower in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction , irrespective of the route of administration .
Race A formal study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic disposition of tacrolimus in Black transplant patients has not been conducted .
However , a retrospective comparison of Black and Caucasian kidney transplant patients indicated that Black patients required higher tacrolimus doses to attain similar trough concentrations .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
Gender A formal study to evaluate the effect of gender on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics has not been conducted , however , there was no difference in dosing by gender in the kidney transplant trial .
A retrospective comparison of pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers , and in kidney , liver and heart transplant patients indicated no gender - based differences .
CLINICAL STUDIES Liver Transplantation The safety and efficacy of Prograf - based immunosuppression following orthotopic liver transplantation were assessed in two prospective , randomized , non - blinded multicenter studies .
The active control groups were treated with a cyclosporine - based immunosuppressive regimen .
Both studies used concomitant adrenal corticosteroids as part of the immunosuppressive regimens .
These studies were designed to evaluate whether the two regimens were therapeutically equivalent , with patient and graft survival at 12 months following transplantation as the primary endpoints .
The Prograf - based immunosuppressive regimen was found to be equivalent to the cyclosporine - based immunosuppressive regimens .
In one trial , 529 patients were enrolled at 12 clinical sites in the United States ; prior to surgery , 263 were randomized to the Prograf - based immunosuppressive regimen and 266 to a cyclosporine - based immunosuppressive regimen ( CBIR ) .
In 10 of the 12 sites , the same CBIR protocol was used , while 2 sites used different control protocols .
This trial excluded patients with renal dysfunction , fulminant hepatic failure with Stage IV encephalopathy , and cancers ; pediatric patients ( ≤ 12 years old ) were allowed .
In the second trial , 545 patients were enrolled at 8 clinical sites in Europe ; prior to surgery , 270 were randomized to the Prograf - based immunosuppressive regimen and 275 to CBIR .
In this study , each center used its local standard CBIR protocol in the active - control arm .
This trial excluded pediatric patients , but did allow enrollment of subjects with renal dysfunction , fulminant hepatic failure in Stage IV encephalopathy , and cancers other than primary hepatic with metastases .
One - year patient survival and graft survival in the Prograf - based treatment groups were equivalent to those in the CBIR treatment groups in both studies .
The overall 1 - year patient survival ( CBIR and Prograf - based treatment groups combined ) was 88 % in the U . S . study and 78 % in the European study .
The overall 1 - year graft survival ( CBIR and Prograf - based treatment groups combined ) was 81 % in the U . S . study and 73 % in the European study .
In both studies , the median time to convert from IV to oral Prograf dosing was 2 days .
Because of the nature of the study design , comparisons of differences in secondary endpoints , such as incidence of acute rejection , refractory rejection or use of OKT3 for steroid - resistant rejection , could not be reliably made .
Kidney Transplantation Prograf / azathioprine Prograf - based immunosuppression in conjunction with azathioprine and corticosteroids following kidney transplantation was assessed in a Phase 3 randomized , multicenter , non - blinded , prospective study .
There were 412 kidney transplant patients enrolled at 19 clinical sites in the United States .
Study therapy was initiated when renal function was stable as indicated by a serum creatinine ≤ 4 mg / dL ( median of 4 days after transplantation , range 1 to 14 days ) .
Patients less than 6 years of age were excluded .
There were 205 patients randomized to Prograf - based immunosuppression and 207 patients were randomized to cyclosporine - based immunosuppression .
All patients received prophylactic induction therapy consisting of an antilymphocyte antibody preparation , corticosteroids and azathioprine .
Overall 1 year patient and graft survival was 96 . 1 % and 89 . 6 % , respectively and was equivalent between treatment arms .
Because of the nature of the study design , comparisons of differences in secondary endpoints , such as incidence of acute rejection , refractory rejection or use of OKT3 for steroid - resistant rejection , could not be reliably made .
Prograf / mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) Prograf - based immunosuppression in conjunction with MMF , corticosteroids , and induction has been studied .
In a randomized , open - label , multi - center trial ( Study 1 ) , 1589 kidney transplant patients received Prograf ( Group C , n = 401 ) , sirolimus ( Group D , n = 399 ) , or one of two cyclosporine regimens ( Group A , n = 390 and Group B , n = 399 ) in combination with MMF and corticosteroids ; all patients , except those in one of the two cyclosporine groups , also received induction with daclizumab .
The study was conducted outside the United States ; the study population was 93 % Caucasian .
In this study , mortality at 12 months in patients receiving Prograf / MMF was similar ( 2 . 7 % ) compared to patients receiving cyclosporine / MMF ( 3 . 3 % and 1 . 8 % ) or sirolimus / MMF ( 3 . 0 % ) .
Patients in the Prograf group exhibited higher estimated creatinine clearance rates ( eCLcr ) using the Cockcroft - Gault formula ( Table 1 ) and experienced fewer efficacy failures , defined as biopsy proven acute rejection ( BPAR ) , graft loss , death , and / or lost to follow - up ( Table 2 ) in comparison to each of the other three groups .
Patients randomized to Prograf / MMF were more likely to develop diarrhea and diabetes after the transplantation and experienced similar rates of infections compared to patients randomized to either cyclosporine / MMF regimen ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .

The protocol - specified target Ctroughs , CsA for Group A were 150 - 300 ng / mL for the first 3 months and 100 - 200 ng / mL from month 4 to month 12 ; the observed median Ctroughs , CsA approximated 225 ng / mL for the first 3 months and 140 ng / mL from month 4 to month 12 .
While patients in all groups started MMF at 1 g BID , the MMF dose was reduced to < 2 g / day in 63 % of patients in the tacrolimus treatment arm by month 12 ( Table 4 ) ; approximately 50 % of these MMF dose reductions were due to adverse events .
By comparison , the MMF dose was reduced to < 2 g / day in 49 % and 45 % of patients in the two cyclosporine arms ( Group A and Group B , respectively ) , by month 12 and approximately 40 % of MMF dose reductions were due to adverse events .

Two g / day of time - averaged MMF dose means that MMF dose was not reduced in those patients during the treatment periods .
In a second randomized , open - label , multi - center trial ( Study 2 ) , 424 kidney transplant patients received Prograf ( n = 212 ) or cyclosporine ( n = 212 ) in combination with MMF 1 gram BID , basiliximab induction , and corticosteroids .
In this study , the rate for the combined endpoint of biopsy proven acute rejection , graft failure , death , and / or lost to follow - up at 12 months in the Prograf / MMF group was similar to the rate in the cyclosporine / MMF group .
There was , however , an imbalance in mortality at 12 months in those patients receiving Prograf / MMF ( 4 . 2 % ) compared to those receiving cyclosporine / MMF ( 2 . 4 % ) , including cases attributed to overimmunosuppression ( Table 5 ) .

The observed median Ctroughs , CsA approximated 280 ng / mL during the first three months and 190 ng / mL from month 4 to month 12 .
Patients in both groups started MMF at 1 g BID .
The MMF dose was reduced to < 2 g / day by month 12 in 62 % of patients in the Prograf / MMF group ( Table 7 ) and in 47 % of patients in the cyclosporine / MMF group .
Approximately 63 % and 55 % of these MMF dose reductions were because of adverse events in the Prograf / MMF group and the cyclosporine / MMF group , respectively .

Heart Transplantation Two open - label , randomized , comparative studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of Prograf - based and cyclosporine - based immunosuppression in primary orthotopic heart transplantation .
In a Phase 3 study conducted in Europe , 314 patients received a regimen of antibody induction , corticosteroids and azathioprine in combination with Prograf or cyclosporine modified for 18 months .
In a 3 - arm study conducted in the US , 331 patients received corticosteroids and Prograf plus sirolimus , Prograf plus mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) or cyclosporine modified plus MMF for 1 year .
In the European Phase 3 study , patient / graft survival at 18 months posttransplant was similar between treatment arms , 91 . 7 % in the tacrolimus group and 89 . 2 % in the cyclosporine group .
In the US study , patient and graft survival at 12 months was similar with 93 . 5 % survival in the Prograf plus MMF group and 86 . 1 % survival in the cyclosporine modified plus MMF group .
In the European study , the cyclosporine trough concentrations were above the pre - defined target range ( i . e . , 100 - 200 ng / mL ) at Day 122 and beyond in 32 - 68 % of the patients in the cyclosporine treatment arm , whereas the tacrolimus trough concentrations were within the pre - defined target range ( i . e . , 5 - 15 ng / mL ) in 74 - 86 % of the patients in the tacrolimus treatment arm .
The US study contained a third arm of a combination regimen of sirolimus , 2 mg per day , and full - dose Prograf ; however , this regimen was associated with increased risk of wound healing complications , renal function impairment , and insulin - dependent post - transplant diabetes mellitus , and is not recommended ( see WARNINGS ) .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Prograf is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving allogeneic liver , kidney , or heart transplants .
It is recommended that Prograf be used concomitantly with adrenal corticosteroids .
Because of the risk of anaphylaxis , Prograf injection should be reserved for patients unable to take Prograf capsules orally .
In heart and kidney transplant recipients , it is recommended that Prograf be used in conjunction with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) .
The safety and efficacy of the use of Prograf with sirolimus has not been established ( see CLINICAL STUDIES ) .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Prograf is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to tacrolimus .
Prograf injection is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to HCO - 60 ( polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil ) .
WARNINGS ( See boxed WARNING ) Post - Transplant Diabetes Mellitus Insulin - dependent post - transplant diabetes mellitus ( PTDM ) was reported in 20 % of Prograf - treated kidney transplant patients without pretransplant history of diabetes mellitus in the Phase III study ( See Tables Below ) .
The median time to onset of PTDM was 68 days .
Insulin dependence was reversible in 15 % of these PTDM patients at one year and in 50 % at 2 years post transplant .
Black and Hispanic kidney transplant patients were at an increased risk of development of PTDM .

[ 3 ] 7 - 12 months for the US Study .
Nephrotoxicity Prograf can cause nephrotoxicity , particularly when used in high doses .
Nephrotoxicity was reported in approximately 52 % of kidney transplantation patients and in 40 % and 36 % of liver transplantation patients receiving Prograf in the U . S . and European randomized trials , respectively , and in 59 % of heart transplantation patients in a European randomized trial ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Use of Prograf with sirolimus in heart transplantation patients in a US study was associated with increased risk of renal function impairment , and is not recommended ( See CLINICAL STUDIES ) .
More overt nephrotoxicity is seen early after transplantation , characterized by increasing serum creatinine and a decrease in urine output .
Patients with impaired renal function should be monitored closely as the dosage of Prograf may need to be reduced .
In patients with persistent elevations of serum creatinine who are unresponsive to dosage adjustments , consideration should be given to changing to another immunosuppressive therapy .
Care should be taken in using tacrolimus with other nephrotoxic drugs .
In particular , to avoid excess nephrotoxicity , Prograf should not be used simultaneously with cyclosporine .
Prograf or cyclosporine should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to initiating the other .
In the presence of elevated Prograf or cyclosporine concentrations , dosing with the other drug usually should be further delayed .
Hyperkalemia Mild to severe hyperkalemia was reported in 31 % of kidney transplant recipients and in 45 % and 13 % of liver transplant recipients treated with Prograf in the U . S . and European randomized trials , respectively , and in 8 % of heart transplant recipients in a European randomized trial and may require treatment ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Serum potassium levels should be monitored and potassium - sparing diuretics should not be used during Prograf therapy ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Neurotoxicity Prograf can cause neurotoxicity , particularly when used in high doses .
Neurotoxicity , including tremor , headache , and other changes in motor function , mental status , and sensory function were reported in approximately 55 % of liver transplant recipients in the two randomized studies .
Tremor occurred more often in Prograf - treated kidney transplant patients ( 54 % ) and heart transplant patients ( 15 % ) compared to cyclosporine - treated patients .
The incidence of other neurological events in kidney transplant and heart transplant patients was similar in the two treatment groups ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Tremor and headache have been associated with high whole - blood concentrations of tacrolimus and may respond to dosage adjustment .
Seizures have occurred in adult and pediatric patients receiving Prograf ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Coma and delirium also have been associated with high plasma concentrations of tacrolimus .
Patients treated with tacrolimus have been reported to develop posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) .
Symptoms indicating PRES include headache , altered mental status , seizures , visual disturbances and hypertension .
Diagnosis may be confirmed by radiological procedure .
If PRES is suspected or diagnosed , blood pressure control should be maintained and immediate reduction of immunosuppression is advised .
This syndrome is characterized by reversal of symptoms upon reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppression .
Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders As in patients receiving other immunosuppressants , patients receiving Prograf are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies , particularly of the skin .
The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent .
A lymphoproliferative disorder ( LPD ) related to Epstein - Barr Virus ( EBV ) infection has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients .
The risk of LPD appears greatest in young children who are at risk for primary EBV infection while immunosuppressed or who are switched to Prograf following long - term immunosuppression therapy .
Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system which can increase susceptibility to infection , combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution .
Latent Viral Infections Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections , including activation of latent viral infections .
These include BK virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) which have been observed in patients receiving tacrolimus .
These infections may lead to serious , including fatal , outcomes .
Prograf in Combination with Sirolimus The use of full - dose Prograf with sirolimus ( 2 mg per day ) in heart transplant recipients was associated with increased risk of wound healing complications , renal function impairment , and insulin - dependent post - transplant diabetes mellitus , and is not recommended ( see CLINICAL STUDIES ) .
Anaphylactic Reactions A few patients receiving Prograf injection have experienced anaphylactic reactions .
Although the exact cause of these reactions is not known , other drugs with castor oil derivatives in the formulation have been associated with anaphylaxis in a small percentage of patients .
Because of this potential risk of anaphylaxis , Prograf injection should be reserved for patients who are unable to take Prograf capsules .
Patients receiving Prograf injection should be under continuous observation for at least the first 30 minutes following the start of the infusion and at frequent intervals thereafter .
If signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis occur , the infusion should be stopped .
An aqueous solution of epinephrine should be available at the bedside as well as a source of oxygen .
PRECAUTIONS General Hypertension is a common adverse effect of Prograf therapy ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Mild or moderate hypertension is more frequently reported than severe hypertension .
Antihypertensive therapy may be required ; the control of blood pressure can be accomplished with any of the common antihypertensive agents .
Since tacrolimus may cause hyperkalemia , potassium - sparing diuretics should be avoided .
While calcium - channel blocking agents can be effective in treating Prograf - associated hypertension , care should be taken since interference with tacrolimus metabolism may require a dosage reduction ( see Drug Interactions ) .
Renally and Hepatically Impaired Patients For patients with renal insufficiency some evidence suggests that lower doses should be used ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
The use of Prograf in liver transplant recipients experiencing post - transplant hepatic impairment may be associated with increased risk of developing renal insufficiency related to high whole - blood levels of tacrolimus .
These patients should be monitored closely and dosage adjustments should be considered .
Some evidence suggests that lower doses should be used in these patients ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Myocardial Hypertrophy Myocardial hypertrophy has been reported in association with the administration of Prograf , and is generally manifested by echocardiographically demonstrated concentric increases in left ventricular posterior wall and interventricular septum thickness .
Hypertrophy has been observed in infants , children and adults .
This condition appears reversible in most cases following dose reduction or discontinuance of therapy .
In a group of 20 patients with pre - and post - treatment echocardiograms who showed evidence of myocardial hypertrophy , mean tacrolimus whole blood concentrations during the period prior to diagnosis of myocardial hypertrophy ranged from 11 to 53 ng / mL in infants ( N = 10 , age 0 . 4 to 2 years ) , 4 to 46 ng / mL in children ( N = 7 , age 2 to 15 years ) and 11 to 24 ng / mL in adults ( N = 3 , age 37 to 53 years ) .
In patients who develop renal failure or clinical manifestations of ventricular dysfunction while receiving Prograf therapy , echocardiographic evaluation should be considered .
If myocardial hypertrophy is diagnosed , dosage reduction or discontinuation of Prograf should be considered .
Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the need for repeated appropriate laboratory tests while they are receiving Prograf .
They should be given complete dosage instructions , advised of the potential risks during pregnancy , and informed of the increased risk of neoplasia .
Patients should be informed that changes in dosage should not be undertaken without first consulting their physician .
Patients should be informed that Prograf can cause diabetes mellitus and should be advised of the need to see their physician if they develop frequent urination , increased thirst or hunger .
As with other immunosuppressive agents , owing to the potential risk of malignant skin changes , exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet ( UV ) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor .
Laboratory Tests Serum creatinine , potassium , and fasting glucose should be assessed regularly .
Routine monitoring of metabolic and hematologic systems should be performed as clinically warranted .
Drug Interactions Due to the potential for additive or synergistic impairment of renal function , care should be taken when administering Prograf with drugs that may be associated with renal dysfunction .
These include , but are not limited to , aminoglycosides , amphotericin B , and cisplatin .
Initial clinical experience with the co - administration of Prograf and cyclosporine resulted in additive / synergistic nephrotoxicity .
Patients switched from cyclosporine to Prograf should receive the first Prograf dose no sooner than 24 hours after the last cyclosporine dose .
Dosing may be further delayed in the presence of elevated cyclosporine levels .
Drugs that May Alter Tacrolimus Concentrations Since tacrolimus is metabolized mainly by the CYP3A enzyme systems , substances known to inhibit these enzymes may decrease the metabolism or increase bioavailability of tacrolimus as indicated by increased whole blood or plasma concentrations .
Drugs known to induce these enzyme systems may result in an increased metabolism of tacrolimus or decreased bioavailability as indicated by decreased whole blood or plasma concentrations .
Monitoring of blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments are essential when such drugs are used concomitantly .
[ 1 ] Drugs That May Increase Tacrolimus Blood ConcentrationsCalcium Channel Blockers Antifungal Agents Macrolide Antibiotics diltiazem clotrimazole clarithromycin nicardipine fluconazole erythromycin nifedipine itraconazole troleandomycin verapamil ketoconazole [ 2 ] voriconazole Gastrointestinal Prokinetic Agents Other Drugs cisapride bromocriptine metoclopramide chloramphenicol cimetidine cyclosporine danazol ethinyl estradiol methylprednisolone lansoprazole [ 3 ] omeprazole protease inhibitors nefazodone magnesium - aluminum - hydroxide [ 1 ] This table is not all inclusive .
[ 2 ] In a study of 6 normal volunteers , a significant increase in tacrolimus oral bioavailability ( 14 ± 5 % vs . 30 ± 8 % ) was observed with concomitant ketoconazole administration ( 200 mg ) .
The apparent oral clearance of tacrolimus during ketoconazole administration was significantly decreased compared to tacrolimus alone ( 0 . 430 ± 0 . 129 L / hr / kg vs . 0 . 148 ± 0 . 043 L / hr / kg ) .
Overall , IV clearance of tacrolimus was not significantly changed by ketoconazole co - administration , although it was highly variable between patients .
[ 3 ] Lansoprazole ( CYP2C19 , CYP3A4 substrate ) may potentially inhibit CYP3A4 - mediated metabolism of tacrolimus and thereby substantially increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations , especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor CYP2C19 metabolizers , as compared to those patients who are efficient CYP2C19 metabolizers .
[ 1 ] Drugs That May Decrease Tacrolimus Blood Concentrations Anticonvulsants Antimicrobials carbamazepine rifabutin phenobarbital caspofungin phenytoin rifampin Herbal Preparations Other Drugs St . John ’ s Wort sirolimus [ 1 ] This table is not all inclusive .
St . John ’ s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) induces CYP3A4 and P - glycoprotein .
Since tacrolimus is a substrate for CYP3A4 , there is the potential that the use of St . John ’ s Wort in patients receiving Prograf could result in reduced tacrolimus levels .
In a single - dose crossover study in healthy volunteers , co - administration of tacrolimus and magnesium - aluminum - hydroxide resulted in a 21 % increase in the mean tacrolimus AUC and a 10 % decrease in the mean tacrolimus Cmax relative to tacrolimus administration alone .
In a study of 6 normal volunteers , a significant decrease in tacrolimus oral bioavailability ( 14 ± 6 % vs . 7 ± 3 % ) was observed with concomitant rifampin administration ( 600 mg ) .
In addition , there was a significant increase in tacrolimus clearance ( 0 . 036 ± 0 . 008 L / hr / kg vs . 0 . 053 ± 0 . 010 L / hr / kg ) with concomitant rifampin administration .
Interaction studies with drugs used in HIV therapy have not been conducted .
However , care should be exercised when drugs that are nephrotoxic ( e . g . , ganciclovir ) or that are metabolized by CYP3A ( e . g . , nelfinavir , ritonavir ) are administered concomitantly with tacrolimus .
Based on a clinical study of 5 liver transplant recipients , co - administration of tacrolimus with nelfinavir increased blood concentrations of tacrolimus significantly and , as a result , a reduction in the tacrolimus dose by an average of 16 - fold was needed to maintain mean trough tacrolimus blood concentrations of 9 . 7 ng / mL .
Thus , frequent monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments are essential when nelfinavir is used concomitantly .
Tacrolimus may affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs ( e . g . , phenytoin ) and increase their concentration .
Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A - mediated metabolism and should be avoided ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Following co - administration of tacrolimus and sirolimus ( 2 or 5 mg / day ) in stable renal transplant patients , mean tacrolimus AUC0 - 12 and Cmin decreased approximately by 30 % relative to tacrolimus alone .
Mean tacrolimus AUC0 - 12 and Cmin following co - administration of 1 mg / day of sirolimus decreased approximately 3 % and 11 % , respectively .
The safety and efficacy of tacrolimus used in combination with sirolimus for the prevention of graft rejection has not been established and is not recommended .
Other Drug Interactions Immunosuppressants may affect vaccination .
Therefore , during treatment with Prograf , vaccination may be less effective .
The use of live vaccines should be avoided ; live vaccines may include , but are not limited to measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , and TY 21 a typhoid . 1 At a given MMF dose , mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) exposure is higher with Prograf co - administration than with cyclosporine co - administration due to the differences in the interruption of the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA .
Clinicians should be aware that there is also a potential for increased MPA exposure after crossover from cyclosporine to tacrolimus in patients concomitantly receiving MMF or MPA .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility An increased incidence of malignancy is a recognized complication of immunosuppression in recipients of organ transplants .
The most common forms of neoplasms are non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphomas and carcinomas of the skin .
As with other immunosuppressive therapies , the risk of malignancies in Prograf recipients may be higher than in the normal , healthy population .
Lymphoproliferative disorders associated with Epstein - Barr Virus infection have been seen .
It has been reported that reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppression may cause the lesions to regress .
No evidence of genotoxicity was seen in bacterial ( Salmonella and E . coli ) or mammalian ( Chinese hamster lung - derived cells ) in vitro assays of mutagenicity , the in vitro CHO / HGPRT assay of mutagenicity , or in vivo clastogenicity assays performed in mice ; tacrolimus did not cause unscheduled DNA synthesis in rodent hepatocytes .
Carcinogenicity studies were carried out in male and female rats and mice .
In the 80 - week mouse study and in the 104 - week rat study no relationship of tumor incidence to tacrolimus dosage was found .
The highest doses used in the mouse and rat studies were 0 . 8 – 2 . 5 times ( mice ) and 3 . 5 – 7 . 1 times ( rats ) the recommended clinical dose range of 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 mg / kg / day when corrected for body surface area .
No impairment of fertility was demonstrated in studies of male and female rats .
Tacrolimus , given orally at 1 . 0 mg / kg ( 0 . 7 – 1 . 4 X the recommended clinical dose range of 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 mg / kg / day based on body surface area corrections ) to male and female rats , prior to and during mating , as well as to dams during gestation and lactation , was associated with embryolethality and with adverse effects on female reproduction .
Effects on female reproductive function ( parturition ) and embryolethal effects were indicated by a higher rate of pre - implantation loss and increased numbers of undelivered and nonviable pups .
When given at 3 . 2 mg / kg ( 2 . 3 – 4 . 6 X the recommended clinical dose range based on body surface area correction ) , tacrolimus was associated with maternal and paternal toxicity as well as reproductive toxicity including marked adverse effects on estrus cycles , parturition , pup viability , and pup malformations .
Pregnancy : Category C In reproduction studies in rats and rabbits , adverse effects on the fetus were observed mainly at dose levels that were toxic to dams .
Tacrolimus at oral doses of 0 . 32 and 1 . 0 mg / kg during organogenesis in rabbits was associated with maternal toxicity as well as an increase in incidence of abortions ; these doses are equivalent to 0 . 5 – 1 X and 1 . 6 – 3 . 3 X the recommended clinical dose range ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 mg / kg ) based on body surface area corrections .
At the higher dose only , an increased incidence of malformations and developmental variations was also seen .
Tacrolimus , at oral doses of 3 . 2 mg / kg during organogenesis in rats , was associated with maternal toxicity and caused an increase in late resorptions , decreased numbers of live births , and decreased pup weight and viability .
Tacrolimus , given orally at 1 . 0 and 3 . 2 mg / kg ( equivalent to 0 . 7 – 1 . 4 X and 2 . 3 – 4 . 6 X the recommended clinical dose range based on body surface area corrections ) to pregnant rats after organogenesis and during lactation , was associated with reduced pup weights .
No reduction in male or female fertility was evident .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Tacrolimus is transferred across the placenta .
The use of tacrolimus during pregnancy has been associated with neonatal hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction .
Prograf should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers Since tacrolimus is excreted in human milk , nursing should be avoided .
Pediatric Patients Experience with Prograf in pediatric kidney and heart transplant patients is limited .
Successful liver transplants have been performed in pediatric patients ( ages up to 16 years ) using Prograf .
Two randomized active - controlled trials of Prograf in primary liver transplantation included 56 pediatric patients .
Thirty - one patients were randomized to Prograf - based and 25 to cyclosporine - based therapies .
Additionally , a minimum of 122 pediatric patients were studied in an uncontrolled trial of tacrolimus in living related donor liver transplantation .
Pediatric patients generally required higher doses of Prograf to maintain blood trough concentrations of tacrolimus similar to adult patients ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Liver Transplantation The principal adverse reactions of Prograf are tremor , headache , diarrhea , hypertension , nausea , and abnormal renal function .
These occur with oral and IV administration of Prograf and may respond to a reduction in dosing .
Diarrhea was sometimes associated with other gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea and vomiting .
Hyperkalemia and hypomagnesemia have occurred in patients receiving Prograf therapy .
Hyperglycemia has been noted in many patients ; some may require insulin therapy ( see WARNINGS ) .
The incidence of adverse events was determined in two randomized comparative liver transplant trials among 514 patients receiving tacrolimus and steroids and 515 patients receiving a cyclosporine - based regimen ( CBIR ) .
The proportion of patients reporting more than one adverse event was 99 . 8 % in the tacrolimus group and 99 . 6 % in the CBIR group .
Precautions must be taken when comparing the incidence of adverse events in the U . S . study to that in the European study .
The 12 - month posttransplant information from the U . S . study and from the European study is presented below .
The two studies also included different patient populations and patients were treated with immunosuppressive regimens of differing intensities .

Post Marketing Post Marketing Adverse Events The following adverse events have been reported from worldwide marketing experience with Prograf .
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , are associated with concomitant diseases and multiple drug therapies and surgical procedures , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors : ( 1 ) seriousness of the event , ( 2 ) frequency of the reporting , or ( 3 ) strength of causal connection to the drug .
There have been rare spontaneous reports of myocardial hypertrophy associated with clinically manifested ventricular dysfunction in patients receiving Prograf therapy ( see PRECAUTIONS - Myocardial Hypertrophy ) .
Other events include : Cardiovascular Atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter , cardiac arrhythmia , cardiac arrest , electrocardiogram T wave abnormal , flushing , myocardial infarction , myocardial ischaemia , pericardial effusion , QT prolongation , Torsade de Pointes , venous thrombosis deep limb , ventricular extrasystoles , ventricular fibrillation Gastrointestinal Bile duct stenosis , colitis , enterocolitis , gastroenteritis , gastrooesophageal reflux disease , hepatic cytolysis , hepatic necrosis , hepatotoxicity , impaired gastric emptying , liver fatty , mouth ulceration , pancreatitis haemorrhagic , pancreatitis necrotizing , stomach ulcer , venoocclusive liver disease Hemic / Lymphatic Disseminated intravascular coagulation , neutropenia , pancytopenia , thrombocytopenic purpura , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura Metabolic / Nutritional Glycosuria , increased amylase including pancreatitis , weight decreased Miscellaneous Feeling hot and cold , feeling jittery , hot flushes , multi - organ failure , primary graft dysfunction Nervous System Carpal tunnel syndrome , cerebral infarction , hemiparesis , leukoencephalopathy , mental disorder , mutism , posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) , progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , quadriplegia , speech disorder , syncope Respiratory Acute respiratory distress syndrome , interstitial lung disease , lung infiltration , respiratory distress , respiratory failure Skin Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses Blindness , blindness cortical , hearing loss including deafness , photophobia Urogenital Acute renal failure , cystitis haemorrhagic , hemolytic - uremic syndrome , micturition disorder .
OVERDOSAGE Limited overdosage experience is available .
Acute overdosages of up to 30 times the intended dose have been reported .
Almost all cases have been asymptomatic and all patients recovered with no sequelae .
Occasionally , acute overdosage has been followed by adverse reactions consistent with those listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section except in one case where transient urticaria and lethargy were observed .
Based on the poor aqueous solubility and extensive erythrocyte and plasma protein binding , it is anticipated that tacrolimus is not dialyzable to any significant extent ; there is no experience with charcoal hemoperfusion .
The oral use of activated charcoal has been reported in treating acute overdoses , but experience has not been sufficient to warrant recommending its use .
General supportive measures and treatment of specific symptoms should be followed in all cases of overdosage .
In acute oral and IV toxicity studies , mortalities were seen at or above the following doses : in adult rats , 52 X the recommended human oral dose ; in immature rats , 16 X the recommended oral dose ; and in adult rats , 16 X the recommended human IV dose ( all based on body surface area corrections ) .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prograf injection ( tacrolimus injection ) For IV Infusion Only NOTE : Anaphylactic reactions have occurred with injectables containing castor oil derivatives .
SeeWARNINGS .
In patients unable to take oral Prograf capsules , therapy may be initiated with Prograf injection .
The initial dose of Prograf should be administered no sooner than 6 hours after transplantation .
The recommended starting dose of Prograf injection is 0 . 01 mg / kg / day ( heart ) or 0 . 03 - 0 . 05 mg / kg / day ( liver , kidney ) as a continuous IV infusion .
Adult patients should receive doses at the lower end of the dosing range .
Concomitant adrenal corticosteroid therapy is recommended early post - transplantation .
Continuous IV infusion of Prograf injection should be continued only until the patient can tolerate oral administration of Prograf capsules .
Preparation for Administration / Stability Prograf injection must be diluted with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection or 5 % Dextrose Injection to a concentration between 0 . 004 mg / mL and 0 . 02 mg / mL prior to use .
Diluted infusion solution should be stored in glass or polyethylene containers and should be discarded after 24 hours .
The diluted infusion solution should not be stored in a PVC container due to decreased stability and the potential for extraction of phthalates .
In situations where more dilute solutions are utilized ( e . g . , pediatric dosing , etc . ) , PVC - free tubing should likewise be used to minimize the potential for significant drug adsorption onto the tubing .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Due to the chemical instability of tacrolimus in alkaline media , Prograf injection should not be mixed or co - infused with solutions of pH 9 or greater ( e . g . , ganciclovir or acyclovir ) .

Liver Transplantation It is recommended that patients initiate oral therapy with Prograf capsules if possible .
If IV therapy is necessary , conversion from IV to oral Prograf is recommended as soon as oral therapy can be tolerated .
This usually occurs within 2 - 3 days .
The initial dose of Prograf should be administered no sooner than 6 hours after transplantation .
In a patient receiving an IV infusion , the first dose of oral therapy should be given 8 - 12 hours after discontinuing the IV infusion .
The recommended starting oral dose of Prograf capsules is 0 . 10 to 0 . 15 mg / kg / day administered in two divided daily doses every 12 hours .
Co - administered grapefruit juice has been reported to increase tacrolimus blood trough concentrations in liver transplant patients .
( See Drugs that May Alter Tacrolimus Concentrations ) .
Dosing should be titrated based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability .
Lower Prograf dosages may be sufficient as maintenance therapy .
Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended early post - transplant .
Dosage and typical tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations are shown in the table above ; blood concentration details are described in Blood Concentration Monitoring : Liver Transplantation below .
Kidney Transplantation The recommended starting oral dose of Prograf ( administered every 12 hours in two divided doses ) is 0 . 2 mg / kg / day when used in combination with azathioprine or 0 . 1 mg / kg / day when used in combination with MMF and IL - 2 receptor antagonist ( see CLINICAL STUDIES ) .
The initial dose of Prograf may be administered within 24 hours of transplantation , but should be delayed until renal function has recovered ( as indicated for example by a serum creatinine ≤ 4 mg / dL ) .
Black patients may require higher doses to achieve comparable blood concentrations .
Dosage and typical tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations are shown in the table above ; blood concentration details are described in Blood Concentration Monitoring : Kidney Transplantation below .
The data in kidney transplant patients indicate that the Black patients required a higher dose to attain comparable trough concentrations compared to Caucasian patients .

If possible , initiating oral therapy with Prograf capsules is recommended .
If IV therapy is necessary , conversion from IV to oral Prograf is recommended as soon as oral therapy can be tolerated .
This usually occurs within 2 - 3 days .
The initial dose of Prograf should be administered no sooner than 6 hours after transplantation .
In a patient receiving an IV infusion , the first dose of oral therapy should be given 8 - 12 hours after discontinuing the IV infusion .
Dosing should be titrated based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability .
Lower Prograf dosages may be sufficient as maintenance therapy .
Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended early post transplant .
Dosage and typical tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations are shown in the table above ; blood concentration details are described in Blood Concentration Monitoring : Heart Transplantationbelow .
Pediatric Patients Pediatric liver transplantation patients without pre - existing renal or hepatic dysfunction have required and tolerated higher doses than adults to achieve similar blood concentrations .
Therefore , it is recommended that therapy be initiated in pediatric patients at a starting IV dose of 0 . 03 - 0 . 05 mg / kg / day and a starting oral dose of 0 . 15 - 0 . 20 mg / kg / day .
Dose adjustments may be required .
Experience in pediatric kidney and heart transplantation patients is limited .
Patients with Hepatic or Renal Dysfunction Due to the reduced clearance and prolonged half - life , patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Pugh ≥ 10 ) may require lower doses of Prograf .
Close monitoring of blood concentrations is warranted .
Due to the potential for nephrotoxicity , patients with renal or hepatic impairment should receive doses at the lowest value of the recommended IV and oral dosing ranges .
Further reductions in dose below these ranges may be required .
Prograf therapy usually should be delayed up to 48 hours or longer in patients with post - operative oliguria .
Conversion from One Immunosuppressive Regimen to Another Prograf should not be used simultaneously with cyclosporine .
Prograf or cyclosporine should be discontinued at least 24 hours before initiating the other .
In the presence of elevated Prograf or cyclosporine concentrations , dosing with the other drug usually should be further delayed .
Blood Concentration Monitoring Monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical parameters is considered an essential aid to patient management for the evaluation of rejection , toxicity , dose adjustments and compliance .
Factors influencing frequency of monitoring include but are not limited to hepatic or renal dysfunction , the addition or discontinuation of potentially interacting drugs and the posttransplant time .
Blood concentration monitoring is not a replacement for renal and liver function monitoring and tissue biopsies .
Two methods have been used for the assay of tacrolimus , a microparticle enzyme immunoassay ( MEIA ) and ELISA .
Both methods have the same monoclonal antibody for tacrolimus .
Comparison of the concentrations in published literature to patient concentrations using the current assays must be made with detailed knowledge of the assay methods and biological matrices employed .
Whole blood is the matrix of choice and specimens should be collected into tubes containing ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) anti - coagulant .
Heparin anti - coagulation is not recommended because of the tendency to form clots on storage .
Samples which are not analyzed immediately should be stored at room temperature or in a refrigerator and assayed within 7 days ; if samples are to be kept longer they should be deep frozen at - 20 ° C for up to 12 months .
Liver Transplantation Although there is a lack of direct correlation between tacrolimus concentrations and drug efficacy , data from Phase II and III studies of liver transplant patients have shown an increasing incidence of adverse events with increasing trough blood concentrations .
Most patients are stable when trough whole blood concentrations are maintained between 5 to 20 ng / mL .
Long - term post - transplant patients often are maintained at the low end of this target range .
Data from the U . S . clinical trial show that tacrolimus whole blood concentrations , as measured by ELISA , were most variable during the first week post - transplantation .
After this early period , the median trough blood concentrations , measured at intervals from the second week to one year post - transplantation , ranged from 9 . 8 ng / mL to 19 . 4 ng / mL .
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring , 1995 , Volume 17 , Number 6 contains a consensus document and several position papers regarding the therapeutic monitoring of tacrolimus from the 1995 International Consensus Conference on Immunosuppressive Drugs .
Refer to these manuscripts for further discussions of tacrolimus monitoring .
Kidney Transplantation Data from a Phase 3 study of Prograf in conjunction with azathioprine indicate that trough concentrations of tacrolimus in whole blood , as measured by IMx ® were most variable during the first week of dosing .
During the first three months of that trial , 80 % of the patients maintained trough concentrations between 7 - 20 ng / mL , and then between 5 - 15 ng / mL , through 1 year .
In a separate clinical trial of Prograf in conjunction with MMF and daclizumab , approximately 80 % of patients maintained tacrolimus whole blood concentrations between 4 - 11 ng / mL through 1 year post - transplant .
In another clinical trial of Prograf in conjunction with MMF and basiliximab , approximately 80 % of patients maintained tacrolimus whole trough blood concentrations between 6 - 16 ng / mL during month 1 - 3 and , then , between 5 - 12 ng / mL from month 4 through 1 year .
The relative risks of toxicity and efficacy failure are related to tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations .
Therefore , monitoring of whole blood trough concentrations is recommended to assist in the clinical evaluation of toxicity and efficacy failure .
Heart Transplantation Data from a European Phase 3 study indicate that trough concentrations of tacrolimus in whole blood , as measured by IMx ® were most variable during the first week of dosing .
From 1 week to 3 months post transplant , approximately 80 % of patients maintained trough concentrations between 8 - 20 ng / mL and , from 3 months through 18 months post transplant , approximately 80 % of patients maintained trough concentrations between 6 - 18 ng / mL .
The relative risk of toxicity ; for example , nephrotoxicity and post - transplant diabetes mellitus , is increased with higher trough concentrations .
Therefore , monitoring of whole blood trough concentrations is recommended to assist in the clinical evaluation of toxicity .
