6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse drug reactions have been identified during post - approval of HALAVEN .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : lymphopenia • Gastrointestinal Disorders : pancreatitis • Hepatobiliary Disorders : hepatotoxicity • Immune System Disorders : drug hypersensitivity • Infections and Infestations : pneumonia , sepsis / neutropenic sepsis • Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : hypomagnesemia , dehydration • Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : interstitial lung disease • Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : pruritus , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on HALAVEN No drug - drug interactions are expected with CYP3A4 inhibitors , CYP3A4 inducers or P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) inhibitors .
Clinically meaningful differences in exposure ( AUC ) were not observed in patients with advanced solid tumors when HALAVEN was administered with or without ketoconazole ( a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a P - gp inhibitor ) and when HALAVEN was administered with or without rifampin ( a CYP3A4 inducer ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Effects of HALAVEN on Other Drugs Eribulin does not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 enzymes or induce CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 enzymes at relevant clinical concentrations .
Eribulin is not expected to alter the plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates of these enzymes [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Do not breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) • Hepatic Impairment : A lower starting dose is recommended for patients with mild ( Child - Pugh A ) and moderate ( Child - Pugh B ) hepatic impairment .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) were not studied .
( 8 . 6 ) • Renal Impairment : A lower starting dose is recommended for patients with moderate ( CLcr 30 - 49 mL / min ) or severe ( CLcr 15 - 29 mL / min ) renal impairment .
( 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from an animal reproduction study and its mechanism of action , HALAVEN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on the use of HALAVEN during pregnancy .
In an animal reproduction study , eribulin mesylate caused embryo - fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses below the recommended human dose [ see Data ] .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically - recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal developmental toxicity study , pregnant rats received intravenous infusion of eribulin mesylate during organogenesis ( Gestation Days 8 , 10 , and 12 ) at doses approximately 0 . 04 , 0 . 13 , 0 . 43 and 0 . 64 times the recommended human dose , based on body surface area .
Increased abortion and severe fetal external or soft tissue malformations , including the absence of a lower jaw and tongue , or stomach and spleen , were observed at doses 0 . 64 times the recommended human dose of 1 . 4 mg / m2 based on body surface area .
Increased embryo - fetal death / resorption , reduced fetal weights , and minor skeletal anomalies consistent with developmental delay were also reported at doses at or above a maternally toxic dose of approximately 0 . 43 times the recommended human dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of eribulin mesylate or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
No lactation studies in animals were conducted .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from eribulin mesylate , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with HALAVEN and for 2 weeks after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females Based on findings from an animal reproduction study and its mechanism of action , HALAVEN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with HALAVEN and for at least 2 weeks following the final dose .
Males Based on its mechanism of action , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraceptionduring treatment with HALAVEN and for 3 . 5 months following the final dose .
Infertility Males Based on animal data , HALAVEN may result in damage to male reproductive tissues leading to impaired fertility of unknown duration [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of HALAVEN in pediatric patients have not been established .
The safety and effectiveness of HALAVEN alone or in combination with irinotecan in pediatric patients were assessed but not established in three open - label studies ( NCT02171260 , NCT03441360 , and NCT03245450 ) in 77 pediatric patients aged 2 to < 17 years with relapsed or refractory solid tumors and lymphomas , excluding central nervous system tumors .
No new safety signals were observed in these studies .
The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of eribulin were within range of values of adult patients with metastatic liposarcoma or other tumors given the same dose per body surface area .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Study 1 did not include sufficient numbers of subjects with metastatic breast cancer aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Of the 827 subjects who received the recommended dose and schedule of HALAVEN in clinical studies with advanced breast cancer , 15 % ( 121 / 827 ) were 65 and older , and 2 % ( 17 / 827 ) patients were 75 and older .
No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects .
Clinical studies of HALAVEN did not include a sufficient number of subjects in Study 2 aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Administration of HALAVEN at a dose of 1 . 1 mg / m2 to patients with mild hepatic impairment and 0 . 7 mg / m2 to patients with moderate hepatic impairment resulted in similar exposure to eribulin as a dose of 1 . 4 mg / m2 to patients with normal hepatic function .
Therefore , a lower starting dose of 1 . 1 mg / m2 is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh A ) and of 0 . 7 mg / m2 is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh B ) .
HALAVEN was not studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment For patients with moderate or severe renal impairment ( CLcr 15 - 49 mL / min ) , reduce the starting dose to 1 . 1 mg / m2 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of HALAVEN has been reported at approximately 4 times the recommended dose , which resulted in Grade 3 neutropenia lasting seven days and a Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction lasting one day .
There is no known antidote for HALAVEN overdose .
11 DESCRIPTION HALAVEN contains eribulin mesylate , a microtubule dynamics inhibitor .
Eribulin mesylate is a synthetic analogue of halichondrin B , a product isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai .
The chemical name for eribulin mesylate is 11 , 15 : 18 , 21 : 24 , 28 - Triepoxy - 7 , 9 - ethano - 12 , 15 - methano - 9 H , 15 H - furo [ 3 , 2 - i ] furo [ 2 ' , 3 ' : 5 , 6 ] pyrano [ 4 , 3 - b ] [ 1 , 4 ] dioxacyclopentacosin - 5 ( 4 H ) - one , 2 - [ ( 2 S ) - 3 - amino - 2 - hydroxypropyl ] hexacosahydro - 3 - methoxy - 26 - methyl - 20 , 27 - bis ( methylene ) - , ( 2 R , 3 R , 3 aS , 7 R , 8 aS , 9 S , 10 aR , 11 S , 12 R , 13 aR , 13 bS , 15 S , 18 S , 21 S , 24 S , 26 R , 28 R , 29 aS ) - , methanesulfonate ( salt ) .
It has a molecular weight of 826 . 0 ( 729 . 9 for free base ) .
The empirical formula is C40H59NO11 • CH4O3S .
Eribulin mesylate has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] HALAVEN is a clear , colorless , sterile solution for intravenous administration .
Each single - dose vial contains 1 mg of eribulin mesylate in 2 mL of solution .
Each mL of solution contains 0 . 5 mg of eribulin mesylate ( equivalent to 0 . 44 mg eribulin ) in dehydrated alcohol ( 5 % v / v ) and water for injection ( 95 % v / v ) .
Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may be used for pH adjustment .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Eribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening phase and sequesters tubulin into nonproductive aggregates .
Eribulin exerts its effects via a tubulin - based antimitotic mechanism leading to G2 / M cell - cycle block , disruption of mitotic spindles , and , ultimately , apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage .
In addition , eribulin treatment of human breast cancer cells caused changes in morphology and gene expression as well as decreased migration and invasiveness in vitro .
In mouse xenograft models of human breast cancer , eribulin treatment was associated with increased vascular perfusion and permeability in the tumor cores , resulting in reduced tumor hypoxia , and changes in the expression of genes in tumor specimens associated with a change in phenotype .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of HALAVEN on the QTc interval was assessed in an open - label , uncontrolled , multicenter , single - arm dedicated QT trial .
A total of 26 patients with solid tumors received 1 . 4 mg / m2 of HALAVEN on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 - day cycle .
A delayed QTc prolongation was observed on Day 8 , with no prolongation observed on Day 1 .
The maximum mean QTcF change from baseline ( 95 % upper confidence interval ) was 11 . 4 ( 19 . 5 ) ms . 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of eribulin is linear with a mean elimination half - life of approximately 40 hours , a mean volume of distribution of 43 L / m2 to 114 L / m2 and mean clearance of 1 . 16 L / hr / m2 to 2 . 42 L / hr / m2 over the dose range of 0 . 25 mg / m2 to 4 . 0 mg / m2 .
The human plasma protein binding of eribulin at concentrations of 100 ng / mL to 1 , 000 ng / mL ranges from 49 % to 65 % .
Eribulin exposure after multiple dosing is comparable to that following a single dose .
No accumulation of eribulin is observed with weekly administration .
Elimination Metabolism Unchanged eribulin was the major circulating species in plasma following administration of 14 C - eribulin to patients .
Metabolite concentrations represented < 0 . 6 % of parent compound , confirming that there are no major human metabolites of eribulin .
Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) negligibly metabolizes eribulin in vitro .
Excretion Eribulin is eliminated primarily in feces unchanged .
After administration of 14 C - eribulin to patients , approximately 82 % of the dose was eliminated in feces and 9 % in urine .
Unchanged eribulin accounted for approximately 88 % and 91 % of total eribulin in feces and urine , respectively .
Specific Populations Age , Sex , and Race / Ethnicity : Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis , no clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of eribulin were observed based on age , sex , or race .
Hepatic Impairment In a study evaluating the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of eribulin , eribulin exposures increased by 1 . 8 - fold in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh A ; n = 7 ) and by 2 . 5 - fold in patients with moderate ( Child - Pugh B ; n = 5 ) hepatic impairment as compared to patients with normal hepatic function ( n = 6 ) .
Administration of HALAVEN at a dose of 1 . 1 mg / m2 to patients with mild hepatic impairment and 0 . 7 mg / m2 to patients with moderate hepatic impairment resulted in similar exposure to eribulin at a dose of 1 . 4 mg / m2 to patients with normal hepatic function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Renal Impairment In a study evaluating the effect of renal impairment on the PK of eribulin , patients with moderate ( CLcr 30 - 49 mL / min ; n = 7 ) and severe renal impairment ( CLcr 15 - 29 mL / min ; n = 6 ) had 1 . 5 - fold higher eribulin dose - normalized exposures compared to that in patients with normal renal function ( CLcr ≥ 80 mL / min ; n = 6 ) .
There were no clinically meaningful changes in patients with mild renal impairment ( CLcr 50 - 79 mL / min ; n = 27 ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Strong Inhibitors or Inducers of CYP3A4 on Eribulin : The effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P - gp inhibitor , ketoconazole , on the PK of eribulin was studied in a crossover trial of 12 patients with advanced solid tumors .
No clinically relevant PK interaction was observed when HALAVEN was administered with or without ketoconazole ( the geometric mean ratio of the AUC : 0 . 97 ; 90 % CI : 0 . 83 , 1 . 12 ) .
The effect of a CYP3A4 inducer , rifampin , on the PK of eribulin was studied in a crossover trial of 14 patients with advanced solid tumors .
No clinically relevant PK interaction was observed when HALAVEN was administered with or without rifampin ( the geometric mean ratio of the AUC : 1 . 10 ; 90 CI % : 0 . 91 , 1 . 34 ) .
Effect of Eribulin on CYP Substrates : Eribulin shows no induction potential for CYP1A , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , and CYP3A in primary human hepatocytes .
Eribulin inhibits CYP3A4 activity in human liver microsomes , but it is unlikely that eribulin will substantially increase the plasma levels of CYP3A4 substrates .
No significant inhibition of CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , or CYP2E1 was detected with eribulin concentrations up to 5 μM in pooled human liver microsomes .
In vitro drug interaction studies indicate that eribulin does not inhibit drugs that are substrates of these enzymes and it is unlikely that eribulin will affect plasma levels of drugs that are substrates of CYP enzymes .
Effect of Transporters on Eribulin : In vitro data suggest that eribulin at clinically relevant concentrations is a substrate of P - gp , but is not a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , multidrug resistance proteins ( MRP2 , MRP4 ) , bile salt extrusion pump ( BSEP ) , organic anion transporting polypeptides ( OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 ) , organic anion transporters ( OAT1 , OAT3 ) , organic cation transporters ( OCT1 , OCT2 ) , or multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 ( MATE1 ) .
Effect of Eribulin on Transporters : In vitro data suggest that eribulin at clinically relevant concentrations may inhibit P - gp , but does not inhibit BCRP , OATP1B1 , OCT1 , OAT1 , OAT3 , or MATE1 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with eribulin mesylate .
Eribulin mesylate was not mutagenic in in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assays ( Ames test ) .
Eribulin mesylate was positive in mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assays , and was clastogenic in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Fertility studies have not been conducted with eribulin mesylate in humans or animals ; however , nonclinical findings in repeat - dose dog and rat toxicology studies suggest that male fertility may be compromised by treatment with eribulin mesylate .
Rats exhibited testicular toxicity ( hypocellularity of seminiferous epithelium with hypospermia / aspermia ) following dosing with eribulin mesylate at or above 0 . 43 times the recommended human dose ( based on body surface area ) given once weekly for 3 weeks , or at or above 0 . 21 times the recommended human dose ( based on body surface area ) given once weekly for 3 out of 5 weeks , repeated for 6 cycles .
Testicular toxicity was also observed in dogs given 0 . 64 times the recommended human dose ( based on body surface area ) weekly for 3 out of 5 weeks , repeated for 6 cycles .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 1 Metastatic Breast Cancer Study 1 was an open - label , randomized , multicenter trial of 762 patients with metastatic breast cancer who received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of metastatic disease and experienced disease progression within 6 months of their last chemotherapeutic regimen .
Patients were required to receive prior anthracycline - and taxane - based chemotherapy for adjuvant or metastatic disease .
Patients were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to receive HALAVEN ( n = 508 ) or a single agent therapy selected prior to randomization ( control arm , n = 254 ) .
Randomization was stratified by geographic region , HER2 / neu status , and prior capecitabine exposure .
HALAVEN was administered at a dose of 1 . 4 mg / m2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 - day cycle .
HALAVEN - treated patients received a median of 5 cycles ( range : 1 to 23 cycles ) of therapy .
Control arm therapy consisted of 97 % chemotherapy ( 26 % vinorelbine , 18 % gemcitabine , 18 % capecitabine , 16 % taxane , 9 % anthracycline , 10 % other chemotherapy ) , and 3 % hormonal therapy .
The main efficacy outcome was overall survival .
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between the treatment arms .
The median age was 55 ( range : 27 to 85 years ) and 92 % were White .
Sixty - four percent of patients were enrolled in North America / Western Europe / Australia , 25 % in Eastern Europe / Russia , and 11 % in Latin America / South Africa .
Ninety - one percent of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 .
Tumor prognostic characteristics , including estrogen receptor status ( positive : 67 % , negative : 28 % ) , progesterone receptor status ( positive : 49 % , negative : 39 % ) , HER2 / neu receptor status ( positive : 16 % , negative : 74 % ) , triple negative status ( ER - , PR - , HER2 / neu - : 19 % ) , presence of visceral disease ( 82 % , including 60 % liver and 38 % lung ) and bone disease ( 61 % ) , and number of sites of metastases ( greater than two : 50 % ) , were also similar in the HALAVEN and control arms .
Patients received a median of four prior chemotherapy regimens in both arms .
In Study 1 , a statistically significant improvement in overall survival was observed in patients randomized to the HALAVEN arm compared to the control arm ( see Table 5 ) .
An updated , unplanned survival analysis , conducted when 77 % of events had been observed ( see Figure 1 ) , was consistent with the primary analysis .
In patients randomized to HALAVEN , the objective response rate by the RECIST criteria was 11 % ( 95 % CI : 8 . 6 % , 14 . 3 % ) and the median response duration was 4 . 2 months ( 95 % CI : 3 . 8 , 5 . 0 months ) .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Liposarcoma The efficacy and safety of HALAVEN were evaluated in Study 2 , an open - label , randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , multicenter , active - controlled trial .
Eligible patients were required to have unresectable , locally advanced or metastatic liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma , at least two prior systemic chemotherapies ( one of which must have included an anthracycline ) , and disease progression within 6 months of the most recent chemotherapy regimen .
Patients were randomized to HALAVEN 1 . 4 mg / m2 administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 - day cycle or to dacarbazine at a dose of 850 mg / m2 , 1000 mg / m2 , or 1200 mg / m2 administered intravenously every 21 days ( dacarbazine dose was selected by the investigator prior to randomization ) .
Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Randomization was stratified by histology ( liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma ) , number of prior therapies ( 2 vs . > 2 ) , and geographic region ( U . S . and Canada vs . Western Europe , Australia , and Israel vs . Eastern Europe , Latin America , and Asia ) .
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival ( OS ) .
Additional efficacy outcome measures were progression - free survival ( PFS ) and confirmed objective response rate ( ORR ) as assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST v1 . 1 ) .
Patients in the dacarbazine arm were not offered HALAVEN at the time of disease progression .
A total of 446 patients were randomized , 225 to the HALAVEN arm and 221 to the dacarbazine arm .
The median age was 56 years ( range : 24 to 83 ) ; 33 % were male ; 73 % were White ; 44 % had ECOG performance status ( PS ) 0 and 53 % had ECOG PS 1 ; 68 % had leiomyosarcoma and 32 % had liposarcoma ; 39 % were enrolled in U . S . and Canada ( Region 1 ) and 46 % were enrolled in Western Europe , Australia , and Israel ( Region 2 ) ; and 47 % received more than two prior systemic chemotherapies .
The most common ( > 40 % ) prior systemic chemotherapies were doxorubicin ( 90 % ) , ifosfamide ( 62 % ) , gemcitabine ( 59 % ) , trabectedin ( 50 % ) , and docetaxel ( 48 % ) .
Of the 143 patients with liposarcoma , the median age was 55 years ( range : 32 to 83 ) ; 62 % were male , 72 % were White ; 41 % had ECOG PS of 0 and 53 % had ECOG PS of 1 ; 35 % were enrolled in Region 1 and 51 % were enrolled in Region 2 ; and 44 % received more than two prior systemic chemotherapies .
The distribution of subtypes of liposarcoma , based on local histologic assessment , were 45 % dedifferentiated , 37 % myxoid / round cell , and 18 % pleomorphic .
Study 2 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients randomized to HALAVEN compared with dacarbazine ( see Table 6 ) .
There was no significant difference in progression - free survival in the overall population .
Treatment effects of HALAVEN were limited to patients with liposarcoma based on pre - planned , exploratory subgroup analyses of OS and PFS ( see Tables 6 and 7 and Figure 2 ) .
There was no evidence of efficacy of HALAVEN in patients with advanced or metastatic leiomyosarcoma in Study 2 ( see Table 7 ) .
