• • A prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to semaglutide or to any of the excipients in RYBELSUS .
Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with RYBELSUS [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
• • Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 ( 4 ) .
• • Prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to semaglutide or any of the excipients in RYBELSUS ( 4 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Pancreatitis : Has been reported in clinical trials .
Discontinue promptly if pancreatitis is suspected .
Do not restart if pancreatitis is confirmed ( 5 . 2 ) .
• • Diabetic Retinopathy Complications : Has been reported in a cardiovascular outcomes trial with semaglutide injection .
Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored ( 5 . 3 ) .
• • Hypoglycemia : Concomitant use with an insulin secretagogue or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia , including severe hypoglycemia .
Reducing dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin may be necessary ( 5 . 4 ) .
• • Acute Kidney Injury : Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions ( 5 . 5 ) .
• • Hypersensitivity Reactions : Serious hypersensitivity reactions ( e . g . , anaphylaxis and angioedema ) have been reported .
Discontinue RYBELSUS if suspected and promptly seek medical advice ( 5 . 6 ) .
• • Acute Gallbladder Disease : If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis are suspected , gallbladder studies are indicated ( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Thyroid C - Cell Tumors In mice and rats , semaglutide caused a dose - dependent and treatment - duration - dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C - cell tumors ( adenomas and carcinomas ) after lifetime exposure at clinically relevant plasma exposures [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
It is unknown whether RYBELSUS causes thyroid C - cell tumors , including medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTC ) , in humans as human relevance of semaglutide - induced rodent thyroid C - cell tumors has not been determined .
Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide , another GLP - 1 receptor agonist , have been reported in the postmarketing period ; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP - 1 receptor agonist use in humans .
RYBELSUS is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2 .
Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of RYBELSUS and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors ( e . g . , a mass in the neck , dysphagia , dyspnea , persistent hoarseness ) .
Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with RYBELSUS .
Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures , due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease .
Significantly elevated serum calcitonin value may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng / L .
If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated , the patient should be further evaluated .
Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated .
5 . 2 Pancreatitis In glycemic control trials , pancreatitis was reported as a serious adverse event in 6 RYBELSUS - treated patients ( 0 . 1 events per 100 patient years ) versus 1 in comparator - treated patients ( < 0 . 1 events per 100 patient years ) .
After initiation of RYBELSUS , observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis ( including persistent severe abdominal pain , sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting ) .
If pancreatitis is suspected , RYBELSUS should be discontinued and appropriate management initiated ; if confirmed , RYBELSUS should not be restarted .
5 . 3 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications In a pooled analysis of glycemic control trials with RYBELSUS , patients reported diabetic retinopathy related adverse reactions during the trial ( 4 . 2 % with RYBELSUS and 3 . 8 % with comparator ) .
In a 2 - year cardiovascular outcomes trial with semaglutide injection involving patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk , diabetic retinopathy complications ( which was a 4 component adjudicated endpoint ) occurred in patients treated with semaglutide injection ( 3 . 0 % ) compared to placebo ( 1 . 8 % ) .
The absolute risk increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at baseline ( semaglutide injection 8 . 2 % , placebo 5 . 2 % ) than among patients without a known history of diabetic retinopathy ( semaglutide injection 0 . 7 % , placebo 0 . 4 % ) .
Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
The effect of long - term glycemic control with semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy complications has not been studied .
Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy .
5 . 4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Patients receiving RYBELSUS in combination with an insulin secretagogue ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia , including severe hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea ( or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue ) or insulin .
Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia .
5 . 5 Acute Kidney Injury There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure , which may sometimes require hemodialysis , in patients treated with GLP - 1 receptor agonists , including semaglutide .
Some of these events have been reported in patients without known underlying renal disease .
A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or dehydration .
Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses of RYBELSUS in patients reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions .
5 . 6 Hypersensitivity Serious hypersensitivity reactions ( e . g . , anaphylaxis , angioedema ) have been reported in patients treated with RYBELSUS .
If hypersensitivity reactions occur , discontinue use of RYBELSUS ; treat promptly per standard of care , and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve .
RYBELSUS is contraindicated in patients with a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to semaglutide or to any of the excipients in RYBELSUS .
[ seeAdverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with GLP - 1 receptor agonists .
Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with another GLP - 1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to anaphylaxis with RYBELSUS .
5 . 7 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP - 1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing .
In placebo - controlled trials , cholelithiasis was reported in 1 % of patients treated with RYBELSUS 7 mg .
Cholelithiasis was not reported in RYBELSUS 14 mg or placebo - treated patients .
If cholelithiasis is suspected , gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow - up are indicated [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information : • • Risk of Thyroid C - cell Tumors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Pancreatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Diabetic Retinopathy Complications [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • • Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • • Acute Kidney Injury [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • • Hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • • Acute Gallbladder Disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 5 % ) are nausea , abdominal pain , diarrhea , decreased appetite , vomiting and constipation ( 6 . 1 ) .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Pool of Placebo - Controlled Trials The data in Table 1 are derived from 2 placebo - controlled trials in adult patients with type 2 diabetes [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
These data reflect exposure of 1071 patients to RYBELSUS with a mean duration of exposure of 41 . 8 weeks .
The mean age of patients was 58 years , 3 . 9 % were 75 years or older and 52 % were male .
In these trials , 63 % were White , 6 % were Black or African American , and 27 % were Asian ; 19 % identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
At baseline , patients had type 2 diabetes for an average of 9 . 4 years and had a mean HbA1c of 8 . 1 % .
At baseline , 20 . 1 % of the population reported retinopathy .
Baseline estimated renal function was normal ( eGFR ≥ 90 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) in 66 . 2 % , mildly impaired ( eGFR 60 to 90 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) in 32 . 4 % and moderately impaired ( eGFR 30 to 60 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) in 1 . 4 % of patients .
Pool of Placebo - and Active - Controlled Trials The occurrence of adverse reactions was also evaluated in a larger pool of adult patients with type 2 diabetes participating in 9 placebo - and active - controlled trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
In this pool , 4116 patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with RYBELSUS for a mean duration of 59 . 8 weeks .
The mean age of patients was 58 years , 5 % were 75 years or older and 55 % were male .
In these trials , 65 % were White , 6 % were Black or African American , and 24 % were Asian ; 15 % identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
At baseline , patients had type 2 diabetes for an average of 8 . 8 years and had a mean HbA1c of 8 . 2 % .
At baseline , 16 . 6 % of the population reported retinopathy .
Baseline estimated renal function was normal ( eGFR ≥ 90 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) in 65 . 9 % , mildly impaired ( eGFR 60 to 90 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) in 28 . 5 % , and moderately impaired ( eGFR 30 to 60 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) in 5 . 4 % of the patients .
Common Adverse Reactions Table 1 shows common adverse reactions , excluding hypoglycemia , associated with the use of RYBELSUS in adult patients with type 2 diabetes in the pool of placebo - controlled trials .
These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on RYBELSUS than on placebo and occurred in at least 5 % of patients treated with RYBELSUS .
Table 1 .
Adverse Reactions in Placebo - Controlled Trials Reported in ≥ 5 % of RYBELSUS - Treated Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adverse Reaction Placebo ( N = 362 ) % RYBELSUS 7 mg ( N = 356 ) % RYBELSUS 14 mg ( N = 356 ) % Nausea 6 11 20 Abdominal Pain 4 10 11 Diarrhea 4 9 10 Decreased appetite 1 6 9 Vomiting 3 6 8 Constipation 2 6 5 In the pool of placebo - and active - controlled trials , the types and frequency of common adverse reactions , excluding hypoglycemia , were similar to those listed in Table 1 .
Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of placebo - controlled trials , gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving RYBELSUS than placebo ( placebo 21 % , RYBELSUS 7 mg 32 % , RYBELSUS 14 mg 41 % ) .
The majority of reports of nausea , vomiting , and / or diarrhea occurred during dose escalation .
More patients receiving RYBELSUS 7 mg ( 4 % ) and RYBELSUS 14 mg ( 8 % ) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions than patients receiving placebo ( 1 % ) .
In addition to the reactions in Table 1 , the following gastrointestinal adverse reactions with a frequency of < 5 % were associated with RYBELSUS ( frequencies listed , respectively , as placebo ; 7 mg ; 14 mg ) : abdominal distension ( 1 % , 2 % , 3 % ) , dyspepsia ( 0 . 6 % , 3 % , 0 . 6 % ) , eructation ( 0 % , 0 . 6 % , 2 % ) , flatulence ( 0 % , 2 % , 1 % ) , gastroesophageal reflux disease ( 0 . 3 % , 2 % , 2 % ) , and gastritis ( 0 . 8 % , 2 % , 2 % ) .
Other Adverse Reactions Pancreatitis In the pool of placebo - and active - controlled trials with RYBELSUS , pancreatitis was reported as a serious adverse event in 6 RYBELSUS - treated patients ( 0 . 1 events per 100 patient years ) versus 1 in comparator - treated patients ( < 0 . 1 events per 100 patient years ) .
Diabetic Retinopathy Complications In the pool of placebo - and active - controlled trials with RYBELSUS , patients reported diabetic retinopathy related adverse reactions during the trial ( 4 . 2 % with RYBELSUS and 3 . 8 % with comparator ) .
Hypoglycemia Table 2 summarizes the incidence of hypoglycemia by various definitions in the placebo - controlled trials .
Table 2 .
Hypoglycemia Adverse Reactions in Placebo - Controlled Trials In Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Placebo RYBELSUS 7 mg RYBELSUS 14 mg Monotherapy ( 26 weeks ) N = 178 N = 175 N = 175 Severe * 0 % 1 % 0 % Plasma glucose < 54 mg / dL 1 % 0 % 0 % Add - on to metformin and / or sulfonylurea , basal insulin alone or metformin in combination with basal insulin in patients with moderate renal impairment ( 26 weeks ) N = 161 - N = 163 Severe * 0 % - 0 % Plasma glucose < 54 mg / dL 3 % - 6 % Add - on to insulin with or without metformin ( 52 weeks ) N = 184 N = 181 N = 181 Severe * 1 % 0 % 1 % Plasma glucose < 54 mg / dL 32 % 26 % 30 % * “ Severe ” hypoglycemia adverse reactions are episodes requiring the assistance of another person .
Hypoglycemia was more frequent when RYBELSUS was used in combination with insulin secretagogues ( e . g . , sulfonylureas ) or insulin .
Increases in Amylase and Lipase In placebo - controlled trials , patients exposed to RYBELSUS 7 mg and 14 mg had a mean increase from baseline in amylase of 10 % and 13 % , respectively , and lipase of 30 % and 34 % , respectively .
These changes were not observed in placebo - treated patients .
Cholelithiasis In placebo - controlled trials , cholelithiasis was reported in 1 % of patients treated with RYBELSUS 7 mg .
Cholelithiasis was not reported in RYBELSUS 14 mg or placebo - treated patients .
Increases in Heart Rate In placebo - controlled trials , RYBELSUS 7 mg and 14 mg resulted in a mean increase in heart rate of 1 to 3 beats per minute .
There was no change in heart rate in placebo - treated patients .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post - approval use of semaglutide , the active ingredient of RYBELSUS .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Gastrointestinal : ileus Hypersensitivity : anaphylaxis , angioedema , rash , urticaria Hepatobiliary : cholecystitis , cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral Medications : RYBELSUS delays gastric emptying .
Instruct patients to closely follow RYBELSUS administration instructions ( 7 . 2 ) .
7 . 1 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue ( e . g . , Sulfonylurea ) or with Insulin RYBELSUS stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations .
Patients receiving RYBELSUS in combination with an insulin secretagogue ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia , including severe hypoglycemia .
When initiating RYBELSUS , consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue ( such as sulfonylureas ) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 2 Oral Medications RYBELSUS causes a delay of gastric emptying , and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of other oral medications .
Levothyroxine exposure was increased 33 % ( 90 % CI : 125 - 142 ) when administered with RYBELSUS in a drug interaction study [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
When coadministering oral medications instruct patients to closely follow RYBELSUS administration instructions .
Consider increased clinical or laboratory monitoring for medications that have a narrow therapeutic index or that require clinical monitoring [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm ( 8 . 1 ) .
• • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8 . 2 ) .
• • Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Discontinue RYBELSUS in women at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long washout period for semaglutide ( 8 . 3 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with RYBELSUS use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
There are clinical considerations regarding the risks of poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Based on animal reproduction studies , there may be potential risks to the fetus from exposure to RYBELSUS during pregnancy .
RYBELSUS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
In pregnant rats administered semaglutide during organogenesis , embryofetal mortality , structural abnormalities and alterations to growth occurred at maternal exposures below the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) based on AUC .
In rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys administered semaglutide during organogenesis , early pregnancy losses and structural abnormalities were observed at exposure below the MRHD ( rabbit ) and ≥ 10 - fold the MRHD ( monkey ) .
These findings coincided with a marked maternal body weight loss in both animal species ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 – 10 % in women with pre - gestational diabetes with an HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 – 25 % in women with a HbA1c > 10 .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease associated maternal and fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , pre - eclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery , and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , stillbirth , and macrosomia related morbidity .
Data Animal Data In a combined fertility and embryofetal development study in rats , subcutaneous doses of 0 . 01 , 0 . 03 and 0 . 09 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 2 - , 0 . 7 - , and 2 . 1 - fold the MRHD ) were administered to males for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and to females for 2 weeks prior to mating , and throughout organogenesis to Gestation Day 17 .
In parental animals , pharmacologically mediated reductions in body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels .
In the offspring , reduced growth and fetuses with visceral ( heart blood vessels ) and skeletal ( cranial bones , vertebra , ribs ) abnormalities were observed at the human exposure .
In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits , subcutaneous doses of 0 . 0010 , 0 . 0025 or 0 . 0075 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 06 - , 0 . 6 - , and 4 . 4 - fold the MRHD ) were administered throughout organogenesis from Gestation Day 6 to 19 .
Pharmacologically mediated reductions in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels .
Early pregnancy losses and increased incidences of minor visceral ( kidney , liver ) and skeletal ( sternebra ) fetal abnormalities were observed at ≥ 0 . 0025 mg / kg / day , at clinically relevant exposures .
In an embryofetal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys , subcutaneous doses of 0 . 015 , 0 . 075 , and 0 . 15 mg / kg twice weekly ( 1 . 9 - , 9 . 9 - , and 29 - fold the MRHD ) were administered throughout organogenesis , from Gestation Day 16 to 50 .
Pharmacologically mediated , marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities ( vertebra , sternebra , ribs ) at ≥ 0 . 075 mg / kg twice weekly ( > 9 X human exposure ) .
In a pre - and postnatal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys , subcutaneous doses of 0 . 015 , 0 . 075 , and 0 . 15 mg / kg twice weekly ( 1 . 3 - , 6 . 4 - , and 14 - fold the MRHD ) were administered from Gestation Day 16 to 140 .
Pharmacologically mediated marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with an increase in early pregnancy losses and led to delivery of slightly smaller offspring at ≥ 0 . 075 mg / kg twice weekly ( > 6 X human exposure ) .
Salcaprozate sodium ( SNAC ) , an absorption enhancer in RYBELSUS , crosses the placenta and reaches fetal tissues in rats .
In a pre - and postnatal development study in pregnant Sprague Dawley rats , SNAC was administered orally at 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ( exposure levels were not measured ) on Gestation Day 7 through lactation day 20 .
An increase in gestation length , an increase in the number of stillbirths and a decrease in pup viability were observed .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of semaglutide in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Semaglutide was present in the milk of lactating rats .
SNAC and / or its metabolites concentrated in the milk of lactating rats .
When a substance is present in animal milk , it is likely that the substance will be present in human milk ( see Data ) .
There are no data on the presence of SNAC in human milk .
Since the activity of UGT2B7 , an enzyme involved in SNAC clearance , is lower in infants compared to adults , higher SNAC plasma levels may occur in neonates and infants .
Because of the unknown potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant due to the possible accumulation of SNAC from breastfeeding and because there are alternative formulations of semaglutide that can be used during lactation , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with RYBELSUS .
Data In lactating rats , semaglutide was detected in milk at levels 3 - 12 fold lower than in maternal plasma .
SNAC and / or its metabolites were detected in milk of lactating rats following a single maternal administration on lactation day 10 .
Mean levels of SNAC and / or its metabolites in milk were approximately 2 - 12 fold higher than in maternal plasma .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discontinue RYBELSUS in women at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long washout period for semaglutide [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of RYBELSUS have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In the pool of glycemic control trials , 1229 ( 30 % ) RYBELSUS - treated patients were 65 years of age and over and 199 ( 5 % ) RYBELSUS - treated patients were 75 years of age and over [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
In PIONEER 6 , the cardiovascular outcomes trial , 891 ( 56 % ) RYBELSUS - treated patients were 65 years of age and over and 200 ( 13 % ) RYBELSUS - treated patients were 75 years of age and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness for RYBELSUS have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The safety and effectiveness of RYBELSUS was evaluated in a 26 - week clinical study that included 324 patients with moderate renal impairment ( eGFR 30 to 59 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
In patients with renal impairment including end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics ( PK ) was observed [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dose adjustment of RYBELSUS is recommended for patients with renal impairment .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment In a study in subjects with different degrees of hepatic impairment , no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics ( PK ) was observed [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dose adjustment of RYBELSUS is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdose , appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient ’ s clinical signs and symptoms .
A prolonged period of observation and treatment for these symptoms may be necessary , taking into account the long half - life of RYBELSUS of approximately 1 week .
11 DESCRIPTION RYBELSUS tablets , for oral use , contain semaglutide , a GLP - 1 receptor agonist .
The peptide backbone is produced by yeast fermentation .
The main protraction mechanism of semaglutide is albumin binding , facilitated by modification of position 26 lysine with a hydrophilic spacer and a C18 fatty di - acid .
Furthermore , semaglutide is modified in position 8 to provide stabilization against degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl - peptidase 4 ( DPP - 4 ) .
A minor modification was made in position 34 to ensure the attachment of only one fatty di - acid .
The molecular formula is C187H291N45O59 and the molecular weight is 4113 . 58 g / mol .
Structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Semaglutide is a white to almost white hygroscopic powder .
Each tablet of RYBELSUS contains 3 mg , 7 mg or 14 mg of semaglutide and the following inactive ingredients : magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , povidone and salcaprozate sodium ( SNAC ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Semaglutide is a GLP - 1 analogue with 94 % sequence homology to human GLP - 1 .
Semaglutide acts as a GLP - 1 receptor agonist that selectively binds to and activates the GLP - 1 receptor , the target for native GLP - 1 .
GLP - 1 is a physiological hormone that has multiple actions on glucose , mediated by the GLP - 1 receptors .
The principal mechanism of protraction resulting in the long half - life of semaglutide is albumin binding , which results in decreased renal clearance and protection from metabolic degradation .
Furthermore , semaglutide is stabilized against degradation by the DPP - 4 enzyme .
Semaglutide reduces blood glucose through a mechanism where it stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion , both in a glucose - dependent manner .
Thus , when blood glucose is high , insulin secretion is stimulated and glucagon secretion is inhibited .
The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying in the early postprandial phase .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics All pharmacodynamic evaluations were performed after 12 weeks of treatment ( including dose escalation ) at steady state semaglutide injection 1 mg .
Fasting and Postprandial Glucose Semaglutide reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations .
In patients with type 2 diabetes , treatment with semaglutide injection 1 mg resulted in reductions in glucose in terms of absolute change from baseline and relative reduction compared to placebo of 29 mg / dL ( 22 % ) for fasting glucose , 74 mg / dL ( 36 % ) for 2 hour postprandial glucose , and 30 mg / dL ( 22 % ) for mean 24 hour glucose concentration .
Insulin Secretion Both first - and second - phase insulin secretion are increased in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with semaglutide compared with placebo .
Glucagon Secretion Semaglutide lowers the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations .
Glucose dependent insulin and glucagon secretion Semaglutide lowers high blood glucose concentrations by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion in a glucose - dependent manner .
During induced hypoglycemia , semaglutide did not alter the counter regulatory responses of increased glucagon compared to placebo and did not impair the decrease of C - peptide in patients with type 2 diabetes .
Gastric emptying Semaglutide causes a delay of early postprandial gastric emptying , thereby reducing the rate at which glucose appears in the circulation postprandially .
Cardiac electrophysiology ( QTc ) The effect of subcutaneously administered semaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc trial .
At an average exposure level 4 - fold higher than that of the maximum recommended dose of RYBELSUS , semaglutide does not prolong QTc intervals to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Semaglutide is co - formulated with salcaprozate sodium which facilitates the absorption of semaglutide after oral administration .
The absorption of semaglutide predominantly occurs in the stomach .
Population pharmacokinetics ( PK ) estimated semaglutide exposure to increase in a dose - proportional manner .
In patients with type 2 diabetes , the mean population - PK estimated steady - state concentrations following once daily oral administration of 7 and 14 mg semaglutide were approximately 6 . 7 nmol / L and 14 . 6 nmol / L , respectively .
Following oral administration , maximum concentration of semaglutide is reached 1 hour post - dose .
Steady - state exposure is achieved following 4 - 5 weeks administration .
Population - PK estimated absolute bioavailability of semaglutide to be approximately 0 . 4 % - 1 % , following oral administration .
Distribution The estimated volume of distribution of semaglutide following oral administration in healthy subjects is approximately 8 L . Semaglutide is extensively bound to plasma albumin ( > 99 % ) .
Elimination With an elimination half - life of approximately 1 week , semaglutide is present in the circulation for about 5 weeks after the last dose .
The clearance of semaglutide following oral administration in healthy subjects is approximately 0 . 04 L / h .
Metabolism The primary route of elimination for semaglutide is metabolism following proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential beta - oxidation of the fatty acid side chain .
Excretion The primary excretion routes of semaglutide - related material are via the urine and feces .
Approximately 3 % of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine as intact semaglutide .
Specific Populations Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis , age , sex , race , ethnicity , upper GI disease , and renal impairment do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide .
The exposure of semaglutide decreases with an increase in body weight .
However , RYBELSUS doses of 7 mg and 14 mg provide adequate systemic exposure over the body weight range of 40 - 188 kg evaluated in the clinical trials .
The effects of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide are shown in Figure 1 .

Body weight categories ( 56 and 129 kg ) represent the 5 % and 95 % percentiles in the dataset .
Abbreviations : Cavg : average semaglutide concentration .
GI : gastrointestinal .
CI : confidence interval .
Patients with Renal impairment - Renal impairment does not impact the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide in a clinically relevant manner .
This was shown in a study with 10 consecutive days of once daily oral doses of semaglutide in patients with different degrees of renal impairment ( mild , moderate , severe , end staged renal disease ) compared with subjects with normal renal function .
This was also shown for subjects with both type 2 diabetes and renal impairment based on data from clinical studies ( Figure 1 ) .
Patients with Hepatic impairment - Hepatic impairment does not have any impact on the exposure of semaglutide .
The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide were evaluated in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment ( mild , moderate , severe ) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function in a study with 10 consecutive days of once daily oral doses of semaglutide .
Patients with disease in the upper GI tract - Upper GI disease ( chronic gastritis and / or gastroesophageal reflux disease ) does not impact semaglutide pharmacokinetics in a clinically relevant manner .
This was shown in a study in patients with type 2 diabetes with or without upper GI disease dosed for 10 consecutive days with once daily oral doses of semaglutide .
Pediatric Patients - Semaglutide has not been studied in pediatric patients .
Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies have shown very low potential for semaglutide to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes , and to inhibit drug transporters .
The delay of gastric emptying with semaglutide may influence the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products .
Trials were conducted to study the potential effect of semaglutide on the absorption of oral medications taken with semaglutide administered orally at steady - state exposure .
No clinically relevant drug - drug interaction with semaglutide ( Figure 2 ) was observed based on the evaluated medications .
Total exposure ( AUC ) of thyroxine ( adjusted for endogenous levels ) was increased by 33 % following administration of a single dose of levothyroxine 600 µg concurrently administered with semaglutide .
Maximum exposure ( Cmax ) was unchanged [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .

Metformin and oral contraceptive drug ( ethinylestradiol / levonorgestrel ) were assessed at steady state .
Effect on levothyroxine is measured as baseline corrected total T4 ( thyroxine ) concentration .
Lisinopril , warfarin ( S - warfarin / R - warfarin ) , digoxin , furosemide , rosuvastatin and levothyroxine were assessed after a single dose .
Abbreviations : AUC : area under the curve .
Cmax : maximum concentration .
CI : confidence interval .
No clinically relevant change in semaglutide exposure was observed when taken with omeprazole .

Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti - drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti - drug antibodies in other studies , including those of semaglutide or of other semaglutide products .
During the 26 - 78 week treatment periods in 5 clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 and 14 . 3 ) ] and 1 clinical trial in Japanese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus , 14 / 2924 ( 0 . 5 % ) of RYBELSUS - treated patients developed anti - semaglutide antibodies .
Of these 14 RYBELSUS - treated patients , 7 patients ( 0 . 2 % of the total RYBELSUS - treated study population ) developed antibodies that cross - reacted with native GLP - 1 .
No identified clinically significant effect of anti - semaglutide antibodies on pharmacokinetics of RYBELSUS was observed .
There is insufficient information to characterize the effects of anti - semaglutide antibodies on pharmacodynamics , safety , or effectiveness of semaglutide .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 2 - year carcinogenicity study in CD - 1 mice , subcutaneous doses of 0 . 3 , 1 and 3 mg / kg / day [ 9 - , 33 - and 113 - fold the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of RYBELSUS 14 mg , based on AUC ] were administered to the males , and 0 . 1 , 0 . 3 and 1 mg / kg / day ( 3 - , 9 - , and 33 - fold MRHD ) were administered to the females .
A statistically significant increase in thyroid C - cell adenomas and a numerical increase in C - cell carcinomas were observed in males and females at all dose levels ( > 3 X human exposure ) .
• In a 2 - year carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats , subcutaneous doses of 0 . 0025 , 0 . 01 , 0 . 025 and 0 . 1 mg / kg / day were administered ( below quantification , 0 . 8 - , 1 . 8 - and 11 - fold the exposure at the MRHD ) .
A statistically significant increase in thyroid C - cell adenomas was observed in males and females at all dose levels , and a statistically significant increase in thyroid C - cell carcinomas was observed in males at ≥ 0 . 01 mg / kg / day , at clinically relevant exposures .
Human relevance of thyroid C - cell tumors in rats is unknown and could not be determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Semaglutide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a standard battery of genotoxicity tests ( bacterial mutagenicity ( Ames ) , human lymphocyte chromosome aberration , rat bone marrow micronucleus ) .
In a combined fertility and embryo - fetal development study in rats , subcutaneous doses of 0 . 01 , 0 . 03 and 0 . 09 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 2 - , 0 . 7 - and 2 . 1 - fold the MRHD ) were administered to male and female rats .
Males were dosed for 4 weeks prior to mating , and females were dosed for 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout organogenesis until Gestation Day 17 .
No effects were observed on male fertility .
In females , an increase in estrus cycle length was observed at all dose levels , together with a small reduction in numbers of corpora lutea at ≥ 0 . 03 mg / kg / day .
These effects were likely an adaptive response secondary to the pharmacological effect of semaglutide on food consumption and body weight .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Increase in lactate levels and decrease in glucose levels in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) were observed in mechanistic studies with SNAC in rats .
Small but statistically significant increases in lactate levels ( up to 2 - fold ) were observed in a few animals at approximately the clinical exposure .
At higher exposures these findings were associated with moderate to marked adverse clinical signs ( lethargy , abnormal respiration , ataxia , and reduced activity , body tone and reflexes ) and marked decreases in plasma and CSF glucose levels .
These findings are consistent with inhibition of cellular respiration and lead to mortality at SNAC concentrations > 100 - times the clinical Cmax .

Combination with Insulin with or without Metformin In a 26 - week double blind trial ( NCT03021187 ) , 731 adult patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on insulin ( basal , basal / bolus or premixed ) with or without metformin , were randomized to RYBELSUS 3 mg , 7 mg and 14 mg once daily or placebo once daily .
All patients reduced their insulin dose by 20 % at randomization to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia .
Patients were allowed to increase the insulin dose only up to the starting insulin dose prior to randomization .
Patients had a mean age of 61 years and 54 % were men .
The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 15 years , and the mean BMI was 31 kg / m2 .
Overall , 51 % were White , 7 % were Black or African American , and 36 % were Asian ; 13 % identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
Treatment with RYBELSUS 7 mg and 14 mg once daily for 26 weeks resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline compared to placebo once daily ( see Table 8 ) .

At week 26 , the primary HbA1c endpoint was missing for 4 . 3 % , 4 . 4 % , and 4 . 4 % of patients randomized to placebo , RYBELSUS 7 mg and RYBELSUS 14 mg , respectively .
Missing values were imputed by a pattern mixture model using multiple imputation ( MI ) .
Pattern was defined by randomized treatment and treatment status at week 26 .
During the trial , additional anti - diabetic medication was initiated as an add on to randomized treatment by 4 . 9 % , 1 . 1 % and 2 . 2 % of patients randomized to placebo , RYBELSUS 7 mg and RYBELSUS 14 mg , respectively .

The difference from placebo ( 95 % CI ) for RYBELSUS 7 mg was - 2 . 0 kg ( - 3 . 0 , - 1 . 0 ) , and for RYBELSUS 14 mg was - 3 . 3 kg ( - 4 . 2 , - 2 . 3 ) .
14 . 4 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Disease PIONEER 6 ( NCT02692716 ) was a multi - center , multi - national , placebo - controlled , double - blind trial .
In this trial , 3 , 183 adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomized to RYBELSUS 14 mg once daily or placebo for a median observation time of 16 months .
The trial compared the risk of a Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event ( MACE ) between RYBELSUS 14 mg and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and cardiovascular disease .
The primary endpoint , MACE , was the time to first occurrence of a three - part composite outcome which included cardiovascular death , non - fatal myocardial infarction and non - fatal stroke .
Patients eligible to enter the trial were 50 years of age or older and had established , stable , cardiovascular , cerebrovascular , peripheral artery disease , chronic kidney disease or NYHA class II and III heart failure or were 60 years of age or older and had other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease .
In total , 1 , 797 patients ( 56 . 5 % ) had established cardiovascular disease without chronic kidney disease , 354 patients ( 11 . 1 % ) had chronic kidney disease only , and 544 patients ( 17 . 1 % ) had both cardiovascular disease and kidney disease ; 488 patients ( 15 . 3 % ) had cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease .
The mean age at baseline was 66 years , and 68 % were men .
The mean duration of diabetes was 14 . 9 years , and mean BMI was 32 kg / m2 .
Overall , 72 % were White , 6 % were Black or African American , and 20 % were Asian ; 16 % identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
Concomitant diseases of patients in this trial included , but were not limited to , heart failure ( 12 % ) , history of ischemic stroke ( 8 % ) and history of a myocardial infarction ( 36 % ) .
In total , 99 . 7 % of the patients completed the trial and the vital status was known at the end of the trial for 100 % .
For the primary analysis , a Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non - inferiority of RYBELSUS 14 mg to placebo for time to first MACE using a risk margin of 1 . 3 .
Type - 1 error was controlled across multiple tests using a hierarchical testing strategy .
Non ‑ inferiority to placebo was established , with a hazard ratio equal to 0 . 79 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 57 , 1 . 11 ) over the median observation time of 16 - months .
The proportion of patients who experienced at least one MACE was 3 . 8 % ( 61 / 1591 ) for RYBELSUS 14 mg and 4 . 8 % ( 76 / 1592 ) for placebo .
