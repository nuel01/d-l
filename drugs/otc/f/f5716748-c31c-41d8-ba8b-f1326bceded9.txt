Fabrazyme is a hydrolytic lysosomal neutral glycosphingolipid - specific enzyme indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with confirmed Fabry disease .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • The recommended dosage is 1 mg / kg body weight given every two weeks as an intravenous infusion .
( 2 . 1 ) • Ensure appropriate medical support is available when Fabrazyme is administered because of the potential for anaphylaxis and severe infusion - associated reactions .
( 2 . 1 , 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) • Administer antipyretics prior to infusion .
( 2 . 1 ) • See the full prescribing information for the recommended infusion rate .
( 2 . 1 ) 2 . 1 Recommended Dosage • The recommended dosage of Fabrazyme is 1 mg / kg body weight infused every two weeks as an intravenous infusion .
• Infusion rate : • – The initial intravenous infusion rate is 0 . 25 mg / min ( 15 mg / hour ) .
Slow the infusion rate in the event of infusion - associated reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• – For patients > 30 kg , after patient tolerance to the infusion is well established , increase the infusion rate in increments of 0 . 05 to 0 . 08 mg / min ( increments of 3 to 5 mg / hour ) with each subsequent infusion .
The minimum infusion duration is 1 . 5 hours ( based on individual patient tolerability ) .
• – For patients weighing < 30 kg , the maximum infusion rate is 0 . 25 mg / minute ( 15 mg / hour ) .

( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions : Life - threatening anaphylactic and severe hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during Fabrazyme infusions .
If severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions occur , immediately discontinue the infusion and provide necessary emergency treatment .
Readministration to patients who have previously experienced severe or serious hypersensitivity reactions to Fabrazyme should be done only after careful consideration of the risks and benefits of continued treatment , and only under the direct supervision of qualified personnel with appropriate medical support measures readily available .
( 5 . 1 ) • Infusion - Associated Reactions : Pretreat patients who experience infusion - associated reactions with an antipyretic and antihistamine .
If an infusion - associated reaction occurs , decrease the infusion rate , temporarily stop the infusion , and consider administration of additional antipyretics , antihistamines , and / or steroids .
If a severe infusion - associated reaction occurs , discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate anaphylaxis treatment .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions In clinical trials and postmarketing safety experience with Fabrazyme , approximately 1 % of patients developed anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reactions during Fabrazyme infusion .
In clinical trials with Fabrazyme , 10 of 238 patients developed IgE antibodies or skin test reactivity specific to Fabrazyme .
Two of six patients in the rechallenge study discontinued treatment with Fabrazyme prematurely due to recurrent infusion - associated reactions .
Four serious infusion - associated reactions occurred in three patients during Fabrazyme infusions , including bronchospasm , urticaria , hypotension , and development of Fabrazyme - specific antibodies .
Other infusion - associated reactions occurring in more than one patient during the study included rigors , hypertension , nausea , vomiting , and pruritus .
Higher incidences of hypersensitivity reactions were observed in adult patients with persistent anti - Fabrazyme antibodies and in adult patients with high antibody titer compared to that in antibody - negative adult patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Life - threatening anaphylactic and severe hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in patients during Fabrazyme infusions .
Reactions have included localized angioedema ( including swelling of the face , mouth , and throat ) , bronchospasm , hypotension , generalized urticaria , dysphagia , rash , dyspnea , flushing , chest discomfort , pruritus , and nasal congestion .
Interventions have included cardiopulmonary resuscitation , oxygen supplementation , intravenous fluids , hospitalization , and treatment with inhaled beta - adrenergic agonists , epinephrine , and intravenous corticosteroids .
If anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reactions occur , immediately discontinue the administration of Fabrazyme and initiate necessary emergency treatment .
Because of the potential for severe hypersensitivity reactions , appropriate medical support measures should be readily available when Fabrazyme is administered .
The risks and benefits of readministering Fabrazyme following an anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reaction should be considered .
If a decision is made to readminister the product , ensure that appropriate medical emergency support is available [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Physicians should consider testing for IgE antibodies in patients who experienced suspected hypersensitivity reactions and consider the risks and benefits of continued treatment in patients with anti - Fabrazyme IgE antibodies .
There are no marketed tests for antibodies against Fabrazyme .
If testing is warranted , contact Genzyme Corporation at 1 - 800 - 745 - 4447 .
Patients who have had a positive skin test to Fabrazyme or who have tested positive for Fabrazyme - specific IgE antibody have been rechallenged with Fabrazyme using a rechallenge protocol .
Rechallenge of these patients should only occur under the direct supervision of qualified personnel with appropriate medical support measures readily available [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Infusion - Associated Reactions In clinical trials of Fabrazyme , 59 % of patients experienced infusion - associated reactions during Fabrazyme administration , some of which were severe .
Infusion - associated reactions are defined as adverse reactions occurring on the same day as the infusion .
The incidence of infusion - associated reactions was higher in patients who were positive for anti - Fabrazyme antibodies than in patients who were negative for anti - Fabrazyme antibodies [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Severe infusion - associated reactions experienced by more than one patient in clinical trials of Fabrazyme included chills , vomiting , hypotension , and paresthesia .
Other infusion - associated reactions included pyrexia , feeling hot or cold , dyspnea , nausea , flushing , headache , fatigue , pruritus , pain in extremity , hypertension , chest pain , throat tightness , abdominal pain , dizziness , tachycardia , nasal congestion , diarrhea , edema peripheral , myalgia , urticaria , bradycardia , and somnolence [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Most patients in clinical trials were pretreated with acetaminophen .
In patients experiencing infusion - associated reactions , pretreatment with an antipyretic and antihistamine is recommended .
Infusion - associated reactions occurred in some patients after receiving pretreatment with antipyretics , antihistamines , and oral steroids .
Infusion - associated reactions tended to decline in frequency with continued use of Fabrazyme .
However , infusion - associated reactions may still occur despite extended duration of Fabrazyme treatment .
If an infusion - associated reaction occurs , decrease the infusion rate , temporarily stop the infusion , and consider administrating additional antipyretics , antihistamines , and / or steroids .
If severe infusion - associated reactions occur , discontinue administration of Fabrazyme immediately and initiate appropriate medical treatment .
Severe reactions are generally managed with administration of antihistamines , corticosteroids , intravenous fluids , and / or oxygen , when clinically indicated .
Because of the potential for severe infusion - associated reactions , ensure appropriate medical support measures are readily available when Fabrazyme is administered .
Monitor closely patients who have experienced infusion - associated reactions when readministering Fabrazyme .
Patients with advanced Fabry disease may have compromised cardiac function , which may predispose them to a higher risk of severe complications from infusion - associated reactions .
Monitor closely patients with compromised cardiac function if Fabrazyme is administered to these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling : • Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Infusion - Associated Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 20 % ) are : upper respiratory tract infection , chills , pyrexia , headache , cough , paresthesia , fatigue , peripheral edema , dizziness , and rash .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Genzyme at 1 - 800 - 745 - 4447 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients in clinical practice .
The data described below reflect exposure of 80 patients , ages 16 to 61 years , to 1 mg / kg Fabrazyme every two weeks in two separate double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials , for periods ranging from 1 to 35 months ( mean 15 . 5 months ) .
All 58 patients enrolled in one of the two studies continued into an open - label extension study of Fabrazyme treatment for up to 54 additional months .
Patients were treated with antipyretics and antihistamines prior to the infusions .
Most Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 enumerates adverse reactions that occurred during the double - blind treatment periods of the two placebo - controlled trials ( Study 1 and Study 2 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The most common adverse reactions reported with Fabrazyme were infusion - associated reactions , ( Fabrazyme 59 % vs placebo 27 % ) some of which were severe ( Fabrazyme 5 . 0 % vs placebo 1 . 7 % ) .
Infusion - associated reactions are defined as adverse reactions occurring on the same day as the infusion .
Common adverse reactions which occurred in ≥ 20 % of patients treated with Fabrazyme and > 2 . 5 % compared to placebo are : upper respiratory tract infection , chills , pyrexia , headache , cough , paresthesia , fatigue , peripheral edema , dizziness and rash .
Table 2 lists the common adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % ) .
Table 2 : Summary of Common Adverse Reactions [ 1 ] in Clinical Trials ( study 1 and 2 ) of Patients with Fabry DiseaseAdverse Reaction Fabrazyme ( n = 80 ) % Placebo ( n = 60 ) % Upper respiratory tract infection [ 2 ] 53 42 Chills [ 3 ] 49 13 Pyrexia 39 22 Headache 39 28 Cough 33 25 Paresthesia 31 18 Fatigue 24 17 Peripheral edema 21 7 Dizziness 21 8 Rash 20 10 Pain in extremity 19 8 Myalgia [ 4 ] 18 7 Lower respiratory tract infection 18 7 Pain 16 13 Back pain 16 10 Hypertension 14 5 Pruritus 10 3 Tachycardia 9 3 Excoriation 9 2 Increased blood creatinine 9 5 Tinnitus 8 3 Dyspnea 8 2 Fall 6 3 Burning sensation 6 0 Anxiety 6 3 Depression 6 2 Wheezing 6 0 Hypoacusis 5 0 Chest discomfort 5 2 Fungal infection 5 0 Viral infection 5 0 Hot flush 5 0 [ 1 ] Reported at rate of at least 5 % in Fabrazyme - treated patients and greater than 2 . 5 % compared to placebo - treated patients .
[ 2 ] Includes reports of upper respiratory infection , nasal congestion , sinusitis , respiratory tract congestion , and pharyngitis .
[ 3 ] Includes reports of chills and feeling cold .
[ 4 ] Includes reports of myalgia and muscle spasms .
Most infusion - associated reactions requiring intervention were ameliorated with slowing of the infusion rate , temporarily stopping the infusion , and / or administration of antipyretics , antihistamines , or steroids .
Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients In Study 3 , the safety profile of Fabrazyme in pediatric Fabry disease patients , ages 8 to 16 years , was similar to that seen in adults .
The most common adverse reactions ( > 20 % ) were headache , abdominal pain , pharyngitis , fever , nausea , vomiting , rhinitis , diarrhea , arthralgia , and dizziness [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Fabrazyme in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other agalsidase beta products may be misleading .
Patients with classic Fabry disease in Study 1 , Study 2 , and extension studies were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to agalsidase beta during the 55 to 58 - month period .
Approximately 83 % ( 110 of 133 ) of adult patients receiving agalsidase beta developed antibodies ; 77 % ( 102 / 133 ) of patients developed neutralizing antibody ( NAb ) that inhibited in vitro agalsidase beta catalytic activity , which declined over time , and 6 % ( 8 / 133 ) of patients developed NAb that inhibited cellular uptake .
In pediatric patients with Fabry disease in Study 3 receiving the recommended dose who were 8 to < 16 years of age , antibodies to agalsidase beta were detected in approximately 69 % ( 11 / 16 ) of patients .
Most patients who developed antibodies did so within the first 3 months of treatment .
Antibody titers generally declined over time .
Approximately 18 % of adult patients who developed antibodies became antibody negative by 74 weeks ( median time ) from the time of seroconversion ; however , none of the pediatric patients became antibody negative .
Female patients generally had lower incidence of antibodies and lower antibody titers compared to male patients .
In Study 5 , patients with truncating GLA mutations had higher incidence of antibodies and higher antibody titers compared to patients with nontruncating GLA mutations .
Patients with plasma α - galactosidase A activity ≤ 1 . 5 nmol / hr / mL had higher incidence of antibodies and higher antibody titers compared to patients with plasma α - galactosidase A activity > 1 . 5 nmol / hr / mL .
In general , over 90 % of adult and pediatric patients treated with agalsidase beta achieved and maintained normalization of plasma globotriaosylceramide ( GL - 3 ) levels irrespective of developing antibodies to agalsidase beta .
Study 4 was an open - label , rechallenge study to evaluate the safety of Fabrazyme treatment in patients who had a positive skin test to Fabrazyme or who had tested positive for Fabrazyme - specific IgE antibodies .
In this study , six adult male patients , who had experienced multiple or recurrent infusion - associated reactions during previous clinical trials of Fabrazyme , were rechallenged with Fabrazyme administered as a graded infusion for up to 52 weeks of treatment .
The initial two rechallenge doses of Fabrazyme were administered as a 0 . 5 mg / kg dose per week at an initial infusion rate of 0 . 01 mg / min for the first 30 minutes ( 1 / 25 th the usually recommended maximum infusion rate ) .
The infusion rate was doubled every 30 minutes thereafter , as tolerated , for the remainder of the infusion up to a maximum rate of 0 . 25 mg / min .
If the patient tolerated the infusion , the dose was increased to 1 mg / kg every two weeks and the infusion rate was increased by slow upwards titration [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Pretreatment was not permitted for at least the first 4 infusions in order to allow early recognition of acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions .
Four of the six patients treated in this study received at least 26 weeks of Fabrazyme ( 2 patients received 26 weeks and 2 patients received 52 weeks ) , and two patients discontinued prematurely due to recurrent infusion - associated reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
Testing for IgE antibodies was performed in approximately 60 patients in clinical trials who experienced moderate to severe infusion - associated reactions or in whom mast cell activation was suspected .
Seven of these patients tested positive for Fabrazyme - specific IgE antibodies or had a positive skin test to Fabrazyme .
Patients who have had a positive skin test to Fabrazyme , or who have tested positive for Fabrazyme - specific IgE antibodies in clinical trials with Fabrazyme have been rechallenged [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
The incidences of hypersensitivity reactions were 51 % ( 41 / 80 ) and 60 % ( 25 / 42 ) in adult patients with persistent anti - Fabrazyme antibodies and in adult patients with high antibody titer , respectively , compared to 30 % ( 7 / 23 ) in antibody - negative adult patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The incidence of infusion - associated reactions was 76 % ( 84 / 110 ) in antibody - positive adult patients compared to 30 % ( 7 / 23 ) in antibody - negative adult patients .
The incidence of infusion - associated reactions was 46 % ( 5 / 11 ) in antibody positive pediatric patients compared to 20 % ( 1 / 5 ) in antibody negative pediatric patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Fabrazyme .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Cardiovascular : cardiorespiratory arrest , cardiac failure , myocardial infarction , palpitations • Hypersensitivity reactions : anaphylaxis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] , localized angioedema ( including auricular swelling , eye swelling , dysphagia , lip swelling , edema , pharyngeal edema , face swelling , and swollen tongue ) , and bronchospasm • General : hyperhidrosis , asthenia , infusion site reaction • Lymphatic : lymphadenopathy • Musculoskeletal : arthralgia • Neurologic : cerebrovascular accident , hypoesthesia , oral hypoesthesia • Pulmonary : respiratory failure , hypoxia • Renal : renal failure • Vascular : leukocytoclastic vasculitis 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry Pregnant women and women of reproductive potential should be encouraged to enroll in the Fabry patient registry .

Hepatocellular necrosis consistent with accumulation of test article was evident in maternal livers in the 10 and 30 mg / kg / day groups ( 23 and 68 times the human dose on a body surface area basis ) .
There were no adverse effects of agalsidase beta on embryo - fetal development in rats .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of agalsidase beta in either human or animal milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant , or on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for Fabrazyme and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Fabrazyme or from the underlying maternal condition .
Lactating women with Fabry disease treated with Fabrazyme should be encouraged to enroll in the Fabry registry [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Fabrazyme have been established in pediatric patients based on adequate and well - controlled studies in adults , a single - arm , open - label study in 16 pediatric patients with Fabry disease aged 8 to 16 years , and additional data in 24 patients with Fabry disease aged 2 to 7 years [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The overall safety profile of Fabrazyme was similar between the pediatric and the adult population [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Fabrazyme did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
11 DESCRIPTION Agalsidase beta is a recombinant human α - galactosidase A enzyme with the same amino acid sequence as the native enzyme .
Purified agalsidase beta is a homodimeric glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 100 kD .
The mature protein is comprised of two subunits of 398 amino acids ( approximately 51 kD ) , each of which contains three N - linked glycosylation sites .
The enzyme α - galactosidase A catalyzes the hydrolysis of GL - 3 and other α - galactyl - terminated neutral glycosphingolipids , such as galabiosylceramide and blood group B substances to ceramide dihexoside and galactose .
The specific activity of agalsidase beta is approximately 70 U / mg ( one unit is defined as the amount of activity that results in the hydrolysis of 1 µmole of a synthetic substrate , p - nitrophenyl - α - D - galactopyranoside , per minute under the assay conditions ) .
Agalsidase beta is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary mammalian cell expression system .
Fabrazyme ( agalsidase beta ) for injection is intended for intravenous infusion .
It is supplied as a sterile , nonpyrogenic , preservative - free , white to off - white , lyophilized cake or powder for reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection , USP .
Each 35 mg vial contains 37 mg of agalsidase beta , as well as 222 mg mannitol , 20 . 4 mg sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate , and 59 . 2 mg sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate .
Following reconstitution as directed , 35 mg of agalsidase beta ( 7 mL ) may be extracted from each 35 mg vial .
Each 5 mg vial contains 5 . 5 mg of agalsidase beta , as well as 33 . 0 mg mannitol , 3 . 0 mg sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate , and 8 . 8 mg sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate .
Following reconstitution as directed , 5 mg of agalsidase beta ( 1 mL ) may be extracted from each 5 mg vial .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Fabrazyme ( agalsidase beta ) provides an exogenous source of α - galactosidase A in Fabry disease patients .
Agalsidase beta is internalized and transported into lysosomes where it exerts enzymatic activity and reduces accumulated GL - 3 .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In Study 1 , baseline mean values for plasma GL - 3 were similar in the Fabrazyme ( 14 . 4 µg / mL ) and the placebo ( 14 . 7 µg / mL ) treatment groups .
In the Fabrazyme treatment group , all 29 patients experienced normalization of plasma GL - 3 levels ( ≤ 7 . 03 µg / mL ) and they maintained normal plasma GL - 3 levels for up to 60 months of treatment .
Follow - up heart and kidney biopsies were assessed at month 54 in only 8 of the 44 patients , which showed sustained GL - 3 clearance in the capillary endothelium of the kidney in 8 patients , and sustained GL - 3 clearance in the capillary endothelium of the heart in 6 patients .
The reduction in tissue GL - 3 is summarized in the clinical studies section ( Table 4 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
In Study 2 , patients in the Fabrazyme treatment group had mean plasma GL - 3 levels that decreased from 9 . 0 µg / mL at baseline ( N = 49 ) to 4 . 8 µg / mL at one year ( N = 37 ) and 4 . 8 µg / mL at two years ( N = 18 ) .
In the placebo group , the mean plasma GL - 3 was 9 . 1 µg / mL at baseline ( N = 31 ) , 8 . 8 µg / mL at one year ( N = 21 ) , and 9 . 4 µg / mL at two years ( N = 7 ) .
In Study 3 , at baseline , all 14 males had elevated plasma GL - 3 levels ( i . e . , > 7 . 03 µg / mL ) , whereas the two female patients had normal plasma GL - 3 levels .
At weeks 24 and 48 of treatment , all 14 males had plasma GL - 3 within the normal range .
The two female patients ' plasma GL - 3 levels remained normal through study week 48 .
Histological evaluation of the capillary endothelium ( vasculature ) , deep vessel endothelium , deep vessel smooth muscle cells , and perineurium of biopsied skin was conducted using histochemistry with light microscopy .
Scoring was on a scale of 0 to 3 ( 0 defined as none ; 1 as mild , 2 as moderate , and 3 as severe ) .
At baseline , 12 of the 14 males had GL - 3 inclusions present on skin biopsy ( scores 1 , 2 , or 3 ) and all 12 achieved GL - 3 inclusion scores of 0 at weeks 24 and 48 of treatment .
The two females had no GL - 3 inclusions in skin at baseline .
In Study 5 , in an analysis of 24 Fabrazyme - treated pediatric patients with Fabry disease aged 2 to < 8 years at Fabrazyme initiation and with elevated plasma GL - 3 levels ( i . e . , > 7 . 03 μg / mL ) at baseline , plasma GL - 3 levels fell within the normal range ( i . e . , ≤ 7 . 03 μg / mL ) in 91 % ( 20 / 22 ) , 95 % ( 18 / 19 ) , and 92 % ( 12 / 13 ) of patients at 6 , 12 , and 24 months , respectively .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of Fabrazyme in clinical studies with adult and pediatric patients with Fabry disease is summarized in Table 3 .
Fabrazyme exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics following intravenous infusions at 0 . 3 ( 30 % of the approved recommended dosage ) , 1 mg / kg , and 3 mg / kg ( 3 times the approved recommended dosage ) in adult patients .
The area under the plasma concentration - time curve ( AUCinf ) and the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) increased greater than dose proportional with increasing doses .
The AUCinf and Cmax following multiple dose administrations were comparable to their values at the first dose .
In pediatric patients 8 to 16 years of age with body weight ranging from 27 to 65 kg , the AUCinf and Cmax following multiple dose administrations were higher compared to their values at the first dose .
The increased plasma concentrations following multiple dose administrations in pediatric patients could be due to formation of antidrug antibodies ; however , such impact was not observed in adult patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility There are no animal or human studies to assess the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of Fabrazyme .
A study to evaluate the effects of agalsidase beta on fertility and general reproduction was performed in male and female rats at doses up to 10 mg / kg / day ( 23 times the human dose , on a body surface area basis ) .
There were no adverse effects of agalsidase beta on fertility and early embryonic development in rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of Fabrazyme were assessed in four clinical studies in patients with Fabry disease and one matched analysis based on data from observational studies .
Study 1 was a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multinational , multicenter study of 58 patients with Fabry disease ( 56 males and 2 females ) , ages 16 to 61 years , all naive to enzyme replacement therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either Fabrazyme 1 mg / kg every 2 weeks or placebo for 20 weeks .
Patients had a median age of 24 years in the placebo group and 33 years in the Fabrazyme group at baseline .
At baseline , all patients had plasma αGAL activity below the detection limit and 79 % had leukocyte αGAL activity below the detection limit .
The median plasma GL - 3 at baseline was 14 . 4 ng / uL in the placebo group and 14 . 7 ng / uL in the Fabrazyme group with the overall range of < 1 . 2 to 36 ng / uL .
The median eGFR at baseline was 98 . 5 mL / hr in the placebo group and 83 . 0 mL / hr in the Fabrazyme group ( overall range 24 to 153 mL / hr ) .
All patients were pretreated with acetaminophen and an antihistamine .
Oral steroids were an additional option to the pretreatment regimen for patients who exhibited severe or recurrent infusion - associated reactions .
Tissue biopsy specimens ( kidney , heart , skin ) were evaluated at baseline and at week 20 by light microscopy for the presence and number of GL - 3 inclusions using a semi - quantitative methodology .
Renal interstitial capillaries were scored based on the number of GL - 3 inclusions on a scale of 0 to 3 ( 0 defined as " nearly none " or " trace , " 1 defined as " mild , " 2 defined as " moderate , " and 3 defined as " severe " ) .
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in either group with a renal capillary GL - 3 inclusion score of zero at week 20 .
In the Fabrazyme group , 20 of 29 ( 69 % ) patients achieved a score of zero while 0 of 29 placebo - treated patients achieved a score of zero ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
Similar reductions in GL - 3 inclusions were observed in the capillary endothelium of the heart and skin ( Table 4 ) .
All 58 patients who completed Study 1 were subsequently treated with Fabrazyme 1 mg / kg every two weeks in an open - label extension study .
After six months of open - label treatment , most patients with available biopsy data achieved a GL - 3 inclusion score of 0 in capillary endothelium ( Table 4 ) .

Study 2 was a randomized ( 2 : 1 Fabrazyme to placebo ) , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multinational , multicenter study of 82 patients ( 72 males and 10 females ) with Fabry disease , all naive to enzyme replacement therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Of the 82 enrolled patients , 51 and 31 patients were randomized to the Fabrazyme and placebo groups , respectively .
Patients were 20 to 72 years of age with a median age of 45 years at baseline , a median age of 36 years at Fabry disease diagnosis , and at a median of 10 years at symptom onset .
The median plasma GL - 3 at baseline was 9 . 3 ug / mL in the placebo group and 8 . 9 ug / mL in the Fabrazyme group with the overall range of 2 . 8 to 18 . 9 ug / mL .
At baseline , patients had median plasma αGAL activity 1 . 5 nmol / hour / mL ( range : 0 to 1 . 5 ) , leukocyte αGAL activity 1 . 8 nmol / hour / mL ( range : 0 to 4 . 0 ) , eGFR 52 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ( range : 25 to 113 ) , and protein to creatinine ratio 0 . 9 mg / mg ( range : 0 to 7 . 3 ) .
Patients received either 1 mg / kg Fabrazyme IV or placebo every two weeks for up to 35 months ( median follow - up 18 . 5 months ) .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a clinically significant event ( renal , cardiac , or cerebrovascular event , or death ) .
A total of 14 of 51 ( 28 % ) Fabrazyme - treated patients and 13 of 31 ( 42 % ) placebo - treated patients experienced a clinically significant event ( HR 0 . 57 , 95 % CI : 0 . 27 , 1 . 22 ) .
Study 3 ( Pediatric Study ) was an open - label , single - arm , multinational , multicenter study in 16 pediatric patients with Fabry disease ( 14 males , 2 females ) , aged 8 to 16 years ( median 12 years ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
At baseline , patients had median plasma αGAL activity 0 . 2 nmol / hour / mL ( range : 0 . 0 , 2 . 0 ) and median leukocyte αGAL activity 0 . 5 nmol / hour / mg ( range : 0 . 0 , 12 . 5 ) .
All 14 males had elevated plasma GL - 3 levels ( i . e . , > 7 . 03 µg / mL ) at baseline , whereas the two females had normal plasma GL - 3 levels .
Median eGFR was normal ( 112 . 1 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) at baseline and did not change during treatment , and median urinary protein was 151 . 0 mg / 24 hr ( range : 70 . 0 , 431 . 0 ) .
All patients received Fabrazyme 1 mg / kg every two weeks for up to 48 weeks .
Study 5 was a long - term , observational study assessing the rate of decline in renal function ( eGFR slope ) in 122 patients with Fabry disease aged 16 years and older treated with Fabrazyme .
Treated patients were matched 1 : 1 based on age ( at Fabrazyme initiation ) , sex , Fabry disease subtype ( classic or non - classic ) , and baseline eGFR to a historical cohort of untreated patients with Fabry disease .
The median follow - up time was 3 years in the untreated group and 4 . 5 years in the treated group ( maximum follow - up time 5 years in both groups ) .
In the matched cohort , the median age ( at Fabrazyme initiation ) was 35 years , 72 % of patients were male , 84 % of patients had the classic Fabry disease subtype , and the median baseline eGFR was 93 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
The estimated mean eGFR slope was - 1 . 5 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 / year in the Fabrazyme - treated group and - 3 . 2 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 / year in the untreated group ( eGFR slope difference : 1 . 7 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 / year ; 95 % CI : 0 . 5 , 3 . 0 ) .
