11 DESCRIPTION INTRAROSA ( prasterone ) vaginal insert is a vaginally administered steroid .
Prasterone is identified chemically as 3β - hydroxyandrost - 5 - en - 17 - one .
It has the empirical formula C 19 H 28 O 2 with a molecular weight of 288 . 424 g / mol .
Prasterone is a white to off - white crystalline powder insoluble in water and soluble in sodium lauryl sulfate ( SLS ) .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each INTRAROSA ( prasterone ) vaginal insert contains 6 . 5 mg of prasterone in 1 . 3 ml of off - white hard fat ( Witepsol ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Prasterone is an inactive endogenous steroid and is converted into active androgens and / or estrogens .
The mechanism of action of INTRAROSA in postmenopausal women with vulvar and vaginal atrophy is not fully established .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In a study conducted in postmenopausal women , administration of the INTRAROSA vaginal insert once daily for 7 days resulted in a mean prasterone C max and area under the curve from 0 to 24 hours ( AUC 0 - 24 ) at Day 7 of 4 . 4 ng / mL and 56 . 2 ng · h / mL , respectively , which were significantly higher than those in the group treated with placebo ( Table 1 ) .
The C max and AUC 0 - 24 of the metabolites testosterone and estradiol were also slightly higher in women treated with the INTRAROSA vaginal insert compared to those receiving placebo .

Serum Concentrations of Prasterone ( A ) , Testosterone ( B ) , and Estradiol ( C ) Measured Over a 24 h Period on Day 7 Following Daily Administration of Placebo or INTRAROSA ( mean ± SD ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] In two primary efficacy trials , daily administration of INTRAROSA vaginal insert for 12 weeks increased mean serum C trough of prasterone and its metabolites testosterone and estradiol by 47 % , 21 % and 19 % from baseline , respectively .
This comparison based on C trough may underestimate the magnitude of increase in prasterone and metabolites ’ exposure because it does not take into account the overall concentration - time profile following administration of INTRAROSA .
Metabolism Exogenous prasterone is metabolized in the same manner as endogenous prasterone .
Human steroidogenic enzymes such as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases , 5α - reductases and aromatases transform prasterone into androgens and estrogens .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with prasterone .
Two metabolites of prasterone , testosterone and estradiol , are carcinogenic in animals .
Mutagenesis Prasterone was not genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial mutagenesis assay ( Ames test ) , the in vitro chromosomal aberrations assay with human peripheral blood lymphocytes , and in vivo in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Fertility Fertility studies were not conducted with prasterone .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of INTRAROSA on moderate to severe dyspareunia , a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy , due to menopause was examined in two primary 12 - week placebo - controlled efficacy trials .
The first clinical trial ( Trial 1 ) was a 12 - week randomized , double - blind and placebo - controlled trial that enrolled 255 generally healthy postmenopausal women between 40 to 75 years of age ( mean 58 . 6 years ) who , at baseline , identified moderate to severe dyspareunia as their most bothersome symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy .
In addition to moderate to severe dyspareunia , women had ≤ 5 % superficial cells on vaginal smear and a vaginal pH > 5 .
Women were randomized in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio between three treatment groups who received daily INTRAROSA ( n = 87 ) , one active comparator vaginal insert ( n = 87 ) , or placebo ( n = 81 ) .
All women were assessed for improvement from Baseline to Week 12 for four co - primary efficacy endpoints : most bothersome moderate to severe symptom of dyspareunia , the percentage of vaginal superficial cells , the percentage of parabasal cells , and vaginal pH . The second clinical trial ( Trial 2 ) was a 12 - week randomized , double - blind and placebo - controlled trial that enrolled 558 generally healthy postmenopausal women between 40 to 80 years of age ( mean 59 . 5 years ) who , at baseline , had identified moderate to severe dyspareunia as their most bothersome symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy .
In addition to dyspareunia , women had ≤ 5 % superficial cells on vaginal smear and a vaginal pH > 5 .
Women were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to receive once daily vaginal insert containing 6 . 5 mg INTRAROSA ( n = 376 ) or placebo ( n = 182 ) .
The primary endpoints and study conduct were the same or similar to those in Trial 1 .
The primary efficacy results obtained in the Intent - to - Treat ( ITT ) population in Trial 1 are shown in Table 2 .
