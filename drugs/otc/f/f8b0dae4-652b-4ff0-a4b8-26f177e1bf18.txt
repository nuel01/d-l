[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Dextrose Injections USP provide calories and are a source of water for hydration .
They are capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient .
Dextrose is readily metabolized , may decrease losses of body protein and nitrogen , promotes glycogen deposition and decreases or prevents ketosis if sufficient doses are provided .
Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirements range from two to three liters ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE These intravenous solutions are indicated for use in adults and pediatric patients as sources of calories and water for hydration .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Solutions containing dextrose may be contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to corn products .
WARNINGS The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration .
WARNING : Dextrose Injection USP contains aluminum that may be toxic .
Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired .
Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature , and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions , which contain aluminum .
Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function , including premature neonates , who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg / kg / day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity .
Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration .
Prolonged infusion of isotonic or hypotonic dextrose in water may increase the volume of extracellular fluid and cause water intoxication .
Solutions containing dextrose without electrolytes should not be administered simultaneously with blood through the same infusion set because of the possibility of agglomeration .
Excessive administration of potassium - free dextrose solutions may result in significant hypokalemia .
Serum potassium levels should be maintained and potassium supplemented as required .
In very low birth weight infants , excessive or rapid administration of dextrose injection may result in increased serum osmolality and possible intracerebral hemorrhage .
PRECAUTIONS General These solutions should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia , renal insufficiency , urinary tract obstruction , or impending or frank cardiac decompensation .
Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason .
Essential electrolytes , minerals , and vitamins should be supplied as needed .
Hypokalemia may develop during parenteral administration of hypertonic dextrose solutions .
Sufficient amounts of potassium should be added to dextrose solutions administered to fasting patients with good renal function , especially those on digitalis therapy .
To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed , the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing , prior to administration , and periodically during administration .
Do not use plastic containers in series connection .
If administration is controlled by a pumping device , care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result .
If administration is not controlled by a pumping device , refrain from applying excessive pressure ( > 300 mmHg ) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting .
Such handling could result in breakage of the container .
These solutions are intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment .
It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours .
Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact .
Dextrose Injection USP contains no more than 25 mcg / L of aluminum .
Laboratory Tests Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require tailoring of the electrolyte pattern , in these or alternative solutions .
Drug Interactions Some additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist .
When introducing additives , use aseptic techniques .
Mix thoroughly .
Do not store .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies with Dextrose Injections USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effects on fertility .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dextrose Injections USP .
It is also not known whether Dextrose Injections USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Dextrose Injections USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Labor and Delivery As reported in the literature , dextrose solutions have been administered during labor and delivery .
Caution should be exercised , and the fluid balance , glucose and electrolyte concentrations and acid - base balance , of both mother and fetus should be evaluated periodically or whenever warranted by the condition of the patient or fetus .
Nursing Mothers Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Dextrose Injections USP are administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use In neonates or in very small infants even small volumes of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance .
Care must be exercised in treatment of neonates , especially pre - term neonates , whose renal function may be immature and whose ability to excrete fluid and solute loads may be limited .
Fluid intake , urine output , and serum electrolytes should be monitored closely .
Serum glucose concentrations should be frequently monitored when dextrose is prescribed to pediatric patients , particularly infants , neonates , and low birth weight infants .
See WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .
Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
These drugs are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to these drugs may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
See WARNINGS .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
Too rapid infusion of hypertonic solutions may cause local pain and venous irritation .
Rate of administration should be adjusted according to tolerance .
Use of the largest peripheral vein and a small bore needle is recommended .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
The physician should also be alert to the possibility of adverse reactions to drug additives .
Prescribing information for drug additives to be administered in this manner should be consulted .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures , and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of a fluid or solute overload during parenteral therapy , reevaluate the patient ' s condition and institute appropriate corrective treatment .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION These solutions are for intravenous use only .
Dosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age , weight , clinical condition of the patient and laboratory determinations .
Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations , and fluid and electrolyte balance during prolonged parenteral therapy .
When a hypertonic solution is to be administered peripherally , it should be slowly infused through a small bore needle , placed well within the lumen of a large vein to minimize venous irritation .
Carefully avoid infiltration .
Fluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement fluid requirements for each patient .
Some additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist .
When introducing additives , use aseptic techniques .
Mix thoroughly .
Do not store .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Pediatric Use There is no specific pediatric dose .
The dose is dependent on weight , clinical condition , and laboratory results .
Follow recommendations of appropriate pediatric reference text .
