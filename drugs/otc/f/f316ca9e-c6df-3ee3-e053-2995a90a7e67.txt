Administer IXEMPRA as a 4 - hour intravenous infusion and monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions .
If the strong inducer is discontinued , reduce the IXEMPRA dose to that before that before starting the strong CYP3A4 inducer [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 6 Preparation and Administration IXEMPRA is a hazardous drug .
Follow aplicable special handling and disposal procedures .
1 IXEMPRA Kit contains two vials , a vial labeled IXEMPRA ( ixabepilone ) for injection which contains ixabepilone powder and a vial containing DILUENT for IXEMPRA .
Use only the supplied DILUENT to reconstitute IXEMPRA ( ixabepilone ) for injection .
Reconstituation 1 .
Prior to reconstituting , remove the IXEMPRA Kit from the refrigerator and allow it to stand at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes .
When the vials are first removed from the refrigerator , a white precipitate may be observed in the DILUENT vial .
This precipitate will dissolve to form a clear solution once the DILUENT warms to room temperature .
2 .
With a suitable syringe , aseptically withdraw the DILUENT and slowly inject it into the IXEMPRA for injection vial .
The 15 - mg IXEMPRA is reconstituted with 8 mL of DILUENT and the 45 - mg IXEMPRA is reconstituted with 23 . 5 mL of DILUENT .
3 .
Gently swirl and invert the vial until the powder in IXEMPRA is completely dissolved .
4 .
After reconstituting with the DILUENT , the concentration of ixabepilone is 2 mg / mL .
5 .
After reconstituting IXEMPRA , dilute the reconstituted with infusion fluid as soon as possible .
The reconstituted solution may be stored in the vial ( not the syringe ) for a maximum of 1 hour at room temperature and room light .
Dilution Before administration , the reconstituted solution must be further diluted with one of the specified infusion fluids listed below .
Other infusion fluids should not be used with IXEMPRA .
The IXEMPRA infusion must be prepared in a DEHP [ di - ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) phthalate ] free bag .
The following infusion fluids have been qualified for use in the dilution of IXEMPRA : Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection , USP 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP ( pH adjusted with Sodium Bicarbonate Injection , USP ) When using a 250 mL or a 500 mL bag of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection to prepare the infusion , the pH must be adjusted to a pH between 6 . 0 and 9 . 0 by adding 2 mEq ( ie , 2 mL of an 8 . 4 % w / v solution or 4 mL of a 4 . 2 % w / v solution ) of Sodium Bicarbonate Injection , prior to the addition of the reconstituted IXEMPRA solution .
• PLASMA - LYTE A Injection pH 7 . 4 ® For most doses , a 250 mL bag of infusion fluid is sufficient .
However , it is necessary to check the final IXEMPRA infusion concentration of each dose based on the volume of infusion fluid to be used .
The final concentration for infusion must be between 0 . 2 mg / mL and 0 . 6 mg / mL .
To calculate the final infusion concentration , use the following formulas : Total Infusion Volume = mL of Reconstituted Solution + mL of infusion fluid Final Infusion Concentration = Dose of IXEMPRA ( mg ) / Total Infusion Volume ( mL ) 1 .
Aseptically , withdraw the appropriate volume of reconstituted solution containing 2 mg of ixabepilone per mL .
2 .
Aseptically , transfer to an intravenous bag containing an appropriate volume of infusion fluid to achieve the final desired concentration of IXEMPRA .
3 .
Thoroughly mix the infusion bag by manual rotation .
4 .
Once diluted with infusion fluid , the solution is stable at room temperature and room light for a maximum of 6 hours .
Administration of diluted IXEMPRA must be completed within this 6 - hour period .
Administration The infusion solution must be administered through an appropriate in - line filter with a microporous membrane of 0 . 2 to 1 . 2 microns .
DEHP - free infusion containers and administration sets must be used .
Discard any remaining solution according to institutional procedures for hazardous drugs .

Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5 . 6 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • Alcohol Content : The alcohol content in a dose of IXEMPRA may affect the central nervous system .
This may include impairment of a patient ' s ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion .
( 5 . 7 ) .
5 . 2 Myelosuppression Severe , life - threatening , or fatal myelosuppression can occur in patients treated with IXEMPRA .
Myelosuppression is dose - dependent and primarily manifests as neutropenia .
In clinical studies , grade 4 neutropenia ( < 500 cells / mm 3 ) occurred in 36 % of patients treated with IXEMPRA in combination with capecitabine and 23 % of patients treated with single agent IXEMPRA monotherapy .
Febrile neutropenia and infection with neutropenia were reported in 5 % and 6 % of patients treated with IXEMPRA in combination with capecitabine , respectively , and 3 % and 5 % of patients treated with IXEMPRA as a single agent , respectively .
Neutropenia - related death occurred in 1 . 9 % of 414 patients with normal hepatic function or mild hepatic impairment treated with IXEMPRA in combination with capecitabine .
The rate of neutropenia - related deaths was higher ( 29 % , 5 out of 17 ) in patients with AST or ALT > 2 . 5 x ULN or bilirubin > 1 . 5 x ULN [ see Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Neutropenia - related death occurred in 0 . 4 % of 240 patients treated with IXEMPRA as a single agent .
No neutropenia - related deaths were reported in 24 patients with AST or ALT > 2 . 5 x ULN or bilirubin > 1 . 5 x ULN treated with IXEMPRA as a single agent .
IXEMPRA is contraindicated for use in patients with a neutrophil count of < 1500 cells / mm 3 .
[ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Monitor patients receiving IXEMPRA for myelosuppression with frequent peripheral blood cell counts .
Withhold , reduce , or discontinue IXEMPRA depending on the severity and persistence of myelosuppression [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 1 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy ( sensory and motor neuropathy ) occurred in patients treated with IXEMPRA in combination with capecitabine and in patients treated with single agent IXEMPRA as shown in Table ( see Table 3 ) .
Table 3 : Peripheral Neuropathya Sensory and motor neuropathy combined .
b 24 % and 27 % of patients in 046 and 081 , respectively , had preexisting neuropathy ( grade 1 ) .
IXEMPRA IXEMPRA as with capecitabine Single Agent Study 046 Study 081 Peripheral neuropathy ( all grades ) a , b 67 % 63 % Peripheral neuropathy ( grades 3 / 4 ) a , b 23 % 14 % Discontinuation due to neuropathy 21 % 6 % Median number of cycles to onset of grade 3 / 4 neuropathy 4 4 Median time to improvement of grade 3 / 4 neuropathy to baseline or to grade 1 6 . 0 weeks 4 . 6 weeks In Studies 046 and 081 , 80 % and 87 % , respectively , of patients with peripheral neuropathy who received IXEMPRA had improvement or no worsening of their neuropathy following dose reduction .
For patients with grade 3 or 4 neuropathy in Studies 046 and 081 , 76 % and 79 % , respectively , had documented improvement to baseline or grade 1 , twelve weeks after onset .
A pooled analysis of 1540 cancer patients treated with IXEMPRA indicated that patients with diabetes mellitus or preexisting peripheral neuropathy may be at increased risk of severe neuropathy .
Patients with moderate to severe neuropathy ( grade 2 or greater ) were excluded from studies with IXEMPRA .
Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy , such as burning sensation , hyperesthesia , hypoesthesia , paresthesia , discomfort , or neuropathic pain .
Withhold , reduce , or discontinue IXEMPRA depending on the severity and persistence of peripheral neuropathy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Increased Toxicities in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Patients with baseline AST or ALT > 2 . 5 x ULN or bilirubin > 1 . 5 x ULN experienced greater toxicity than patients with baseline AST or ALT ≤ 2 . 5 x ULN or bilirubin ≤ 1 . 5 x ULN when treated with IXEMPRA at 40 mg / m 2 in combination with capecitabine or as single agent in breast cancer studies .
In combination with capecitabine , the overall frequency of grade 3 / 4 adverse reactions , febrile neutropenia , serious adverse reactions , and toxicity - related deaths was increased oin patients with hepatic impairment .
IXEMPRA in combination with capecitabine is contraindicated in patients with AST or ALT > 2 . 5 x ULN or bilirubin > 1 x ULN due to increased risk of toxicity - and neutropenia - related death [ see Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
With IXEMPRA single agent therapy , grade 4 neutropenia , febrile neutropenia , and serious adverse reatcitons were increased in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) .
Reduce the dose IXEMPRA based in the degree of hepatic impairment .
Avoid use in patients with AST or ALT > 10 x ULN or bilirubin > 3 x ULN [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] 5 . 4 Hypersensitivity Reactions IXEMPRA is contraindicated in patients with a history of a severe hypersensitivity reaction to agents containing Cremophor ® EL or its derivatives ( eg , polyoxyethylated castor oil ) [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Of the 1323 patients treated with IXEMPRA in clinical studies , 9 patients ( 1 % ) had experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions ( including anaphylaxis ) .
Three of the 9 patients were able to be retreated .
Patients who experience a hypersensitivity reaction in one cycle of IXEMPRA must be premedicated in subsequent cycles with a corticosteroid in addition to the H 1 and H 2 antagonists , and extension of the infusion time should be considered [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Contraindications ( 4 ) ] Administer an H 1 and H 2 antagonist approximately 1 hour before IXEMPRA infusion and observe patients for hypersensitivity reaction occur , stop the infusion of IXEMPRA provide supportive treatment as clinically indicated ( e . g ..
epinephrine , corticosteriods ) .
5 . 5 Cardiac Adverse Reactions Cardiac adverse reactions ( myocardial ischemia and ventricular dysfunction ) occurred in patients receiving IXEMPRA in combination with capecitabine ( 1 . 9 % ) and as a single agent ( 0 . 3 % ) .
Supraventricular arrhythmias were observed in the combination arm ( 0 . 5 % ) .
Closely monitor patients with a history of cardiac disease during treatment with IXEMPRA .
Consider discontinuation of IXEMPRA in patients who develop cardiac ischemia or impaired cardiac function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 6 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action , IXEMPRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In animal reproduction studies , intravenous administration of ixabepilone to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused maternal toxicity , embryo - fetal lethality , and fetal abnormalities at maternal exposures below the human clinical exposure based on AUC .
Advise females of reproductive potential and pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IXEMPRA and for 7 months after the last dose .
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IXEMPRA and for 4 months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 7 Alcohol Content The alcohol content in a dose of IXEMPRA may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized .
Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in IXEMPRA on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion .
Each administration of IXEMPRA at the recommended dosage of 40 mg / m 2 delivers approximately 8 . 4 g / m 2 of ethanol .
For a patient with a BSA of 2 . 0 m 2 , this would deliver approximately 16 . 8 grams of ethanol [ see Description ( 11 ) ] .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Procedural Complications : Radiation recall 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : • Avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitors .
If coadministration cannot be avoided , reduce the dosage of IXEMPRA ( 2 . 5 , 7 . 1 ) .
Strong CYP3A4 Inducers : • Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers .
If coadministration cannot be avoided , reduce the dosage of IXEMPRA ( 2 . 5 , 7 . 1 ) .
7 . 1 Effect of Other Drugs on IXEMPRA Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors The coadministration of IXEMPRA with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increased ixabepilone plasma concentration , which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of IXEMPRA .
Avoid coadministration of IXEMPRA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors .
If the coadministration of IXEMPRA with strong CYP3A4 cannot be avoided , reduce the dose of IXEMPRA [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ] .
Moderate or Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors The coadministration of IXEMPRA with moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of IXEMPRA .
Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce the dose of IXEMPRA as recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Strong CYP3A4 Inducers The coadministration of IXEMPRA with a strong CYP3A4 inducer , decreased plasma concentrations of ixabepilone , which may decrease the efficacy of IXEMPRA [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Avoid the coadministration IXEMPRA with strong CYP3A4 inducers .
If the coadministration of IXEMPRA with a strong CYP3A4 inducer cannot be avoided , increase the dose of IXEMPRA [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Concomitant Use of IXEMPRA and Capecitabine No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of ixabepilone and capecitabine were observed when IXEMPRA was administered in combination with capecitabine ( 1000 mg / m 2 ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Effect of Ixabepilone on Other Drugs Ixabepilone does not inhibit CYP enzymes at relevant clinical concentrations and is not expected to alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Capecitabine In patients with cancer who received ixabepilone ( 40 mg / m 2 ) in combination with capecitabine ( 1000 mg / m 2 ) , ixabepilone Cmax decreased by 19 % , capecitabine Cmax decreased by 27 % , and 5 - fluorouracil AUC increased by 14 % , as compared to ixabepilone or capecitabine administered separately .
The interaction is not clinically significant given that the combination treatment is supported by efficacy data .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed ( 8 . 2 ) .
• Hepatic Impairment : Reduce the dosage in patients with elevated AST , ALT , or bilirubin ( 2 . 4 , 8 . 6 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action , IXEMPRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on the use of IXEMPRA in pregnant women to inform the drug - associated risk .
IXEMPRA contains alcohol which can interfere with neurobehavioral development [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
In animal reproduction studies , intravenous administration of ixabepilone to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused maternal toxicity , embryo - fetal lethality , and fetal abnormalities at maternal exposures below the human clinical exposure based on AUC ( see Data ) .
Advise females of reproductive potential and pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations IXEMPRA contains alcohol [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Published studies have demonstrated that alcohol is associated with fetal harm including central nervous system abnormalities , behavioral disorders , and impaired intellectual development .
Data Animal data In embryo - fetal development studies , pregnant rats and rabbits received intravenous doses of 0 . 02 , 0 . 08 , and 0 . 3 mg / kg / day and 0 . 01 , 0 . 03 , 0 . 11 , and 0 . 3 mg / kg / day , respectively during the period of organogenesis .
In rats , an increase in resorptions and post - implantation loss and a decrease in the number of live fetuses and fetal weight was observed at the maternally toxic dose of 0 . 3 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 1 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC ) .
Abnormalities included a reduced ossification of caudal vertebrae , sternebrae , and metacarpals .
In rabbits , ixabepilone caused maternal toxicity ( death ) and embryo - fetal toxicity ( resorptions ) at 0 . 3 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 1 times the human clinical dose based on body surface area ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data on the presence of IXEMPRA in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Ixabepilone and / or its metabolites were present in milk of lactating rats ( see Data ) .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with IXEMPRA and for 2 weeks after the last dose .
Data Animal data Following intravenous administration of radiolabeled ixabepilone to rats on days 7 to 9 postpartum , concentrations of radioactivity in milk were comparable with those in plasma and declined in parallel with the plasma concentrations .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action , IXEMPRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with IXEMPRA .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IXEMPRA and for 7 months after the last dose .
Males Based on genotoxicity and animal studies , advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IXEMPRA and for 4 months after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Based on findings in animals , IXEMPRA may impair male and female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
.
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The alcohol content of IXEMPRA should be taken into account when given to pediatric patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of IXEMPRA in pediatric patients have not been established .
Safety and efficacy were assessed , but not established for IXEMPRA across two studies : an open - label , dose - finding trial in 21 patients aged 2 to 18 years with advanced or refractory solid tumors and hematologic malignancies [ NCT00030108 ] and a trial with 28 patients aged 3 to 18 years with advanced or refractory solid tumors [ NCT00331643 ] that was terminated early due to lack of efficacy .
No new safety signals were identified .
The median BSA normalized clearance of ixabepilone in 16 patients aged 2 to 18 years ( 17 L / h / m 2 ) was within range of that of patients greater than 18 years ( 20 L / h / m 2 ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of IXEMPRA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged sixty - five and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Of the 431 patients treated with IXEMPRA in combination with capecitabine , 10 % were 65 years of age and over , and 0 . 1 % were 75 years of age and over .
The incidence of grade 3 / 4 adverse reactions was higher in patients ³ 65 years of age versus those < 65 years of age ( 82 % versus 68 % ) including grade 3 / 4 stomatitis ( 9 % versus 1 % ) , diarrhea ( 9 % versus 6 % ) , palmar - plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome ( 27 % versus 20 % ) , peripheral neuropathy ( 24 % versus 22 % ) , febrile neutropenia ( 9 % versus 3 % ) , fatigue ( 16 % versus 12 % ) , and asthenia ( 11 % versus 6 % ) .
Deaths due to adverse reactions occurred in 2 ( 4 . 7 % ) of 43 patients ³ 65 years with normal baseline hepatic function or mild impairment .
Of the 240 patients with breast cancer treated with IXEMPRA as a single agent , 13 % were 65 years of age and over , and 0 . 2 % were 75 years of age and over .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Monitor hepatic function before initiation of IXEMPRA and periodically thereafter .
Dose reduction is recommended when administering IXEMPRA as a single agent to patients with hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
IXEMPRA in combination with capecitabine is contraindicated in patients with AST or ALT > 2 . 5 x ULN or bilirubin > 1 x ULN [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
The alcohol content of IXEMPRA should be taken into account when given to patients with hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In patients who received an overdosage of IXEMPRA of up to 100 mg / m 2 ( approximately 2 . 5 times the recommended dosage ) , peripheral neuropathy , fatigue , musculoskeletal pain / myalgia , and gastrointestinal symptoms ( nausea , anorexia , diarrhea , abdominal pain , stomatitis ) occurred .
There is no known antidote for overdosage of IXEMPRA .
In case of overdosage , closely monitor patients for adverse reactions and provide supportive treatment as clinically indicated .
11 DESCRIPTION IXEMPRA ( ixabepilone ) is a microtubule inhibitor belonging to a class of antineoplastic agents , the epothilones and their analogs .
The epothilones are isolated from the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum .
Ixabepilone is a semisynthetic analog of epothilone B , a 16 - membered polyketide macrolide , with a chemically modified lactam substitution for the naturally existing lactone .
The chemical name for ixabepilone is ( 1 S , 3 S , 7 S , 10 R , 11 S , 12 S , 16 R ) - 7 , 11 - dihydroxy - 8 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 - pentamethyl - 3 - [ ( 1 E ) - 1 - methyl - 2 - ( 2 - methyl - 4 - thiazolyl ) ethenyl ] - 17 - oxa - 4 - azabicyclo [ 14 . 1 . 0 ] heptadecane - 5 , 9 - dione , and it has a molecular weight of 506 . 7 .
Ixabepilone has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] IXEMPRA ( ixabepilone ) for injection is intended for intravenous infusion only after constitution with the supplied DILUENT and after further dilution with a specified infusion fluid [ see dosage ( 2 . ) ]
.
IXEMPRA ( ixabepilone ) for injection is supplied as a sterile , non - pyrogenic , single - dose vial providing 15 mg or 45 mg ixabepilone as a lyophilized white powder .
The DILUENT for IXEMPRA is a sterile , non - pyrogenic , solution of 52 . 8 % ( w / v ) purified polyoxyethylated castor oil and 39 . 8 % ( w / v ) dehydrated alcohol , USP .
The IXEMPRA ( ixabepilone ) for injection and the DILUENT for IXEMPRA are copackaged and supplied as IXEMPRA Kit [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ixabepilone is a semi - synthetic analog of epothilone B . Ixabepilone binds directly to β - tubulin subunits on microtubules , leading to suppression of microtubule dynamics .
Ixabepilone suppresses the dynamic instability of αβ - II and αβ - III microtubules .
Ixabepilone possesses low in vitro susceptibility to multiple tumor resistance mechanisms including efflux transporters , such as MRP - 1 and P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) .
Ixabepilone blocks cells in the mitotic phase of the cell division cycle , leading to cell death .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Ixabepilone has a plasma concentration - dependent effect on tubulin dynamics in peripheral blood mononuclear cells that is observed as the formation of microtubule bundles .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At the recommended dosage , IXEMPRA does not cause large mean increases ( i . e . , > 20 msec ) in the QT interval .
The QT prolongation potential of ixabepilone was assessed as part of an uncontrolled , open - label , single - dose study in advanced cancer patients .
Fourteen patients received a single dose of IXEMPRA 40 mg / m2 intravenously over 3 hours and serial ECGs were collected over 24 hours .
The maximum mean ΔQTcF was observed 1 hour after the end of infusion and was 8 ms ( upper 95 % CI : 12 ms ) .
No patients had a QTcF interval > 450 ms or ΔQTcF > 30 ms after IXEMPRA administration .
However , small increases in QTc interval with the use of ixabepilone cannot be excluded due to study design limitations 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following administration of a single 40 mg / m 2 dose of IXEMPRA , the mean ( % coefficient of variation ) maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) was 252 ng / mL ( 56 % ) , and the mean ( % CV ) area under the curve ( AUC ) was 2 , 143 ng · hr / mL ( 48 % ) .
The pharmacokinetics of ixabepilone were linear at doses of 15 ( 0 . 375 times the approved recommended dosage ) to 57 mg / m 2 ( 1 . 425 times the approved recommended dosage ) .
Distribution The mean ( % CV ) volume of distribution at steady - state was greater than1 , 000 L ( x CV % ) .
Serum protein binding of ixabepilone ranged from 67 % to 77 % and the blood - to - plasma concentration ratios ranged from 0 . 65 to 0 . 85 .
Elimination Ixabepilone has a terminal elimination half - life of approximately 52 hours ( x CV % ) .
Metabolism Ixabepilone is metabolized by CYP3A4 .
Excretion Ixabepilone is eliminated primarily as metabolites in feces ( 65 % of the dose ) and in urine ( 21 % of the dose ) .
Unchanged ixabepilone accounted for approximately 1 . 6 % and 5 . 6 % of the dose in feces and urine , respectively .
Specific Populations Based upon a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 676 cancer patients , gender , race , age , mild and moderate renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance [ CLcr ] CrCL > 30 mL / min ) do not have clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of ixabepilone .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment IXEMPRA was evaluated in 56 patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment defined by bilirubin levels and AST levels .
Compared to patients with normal hepatic function ( n = 17 ) , the area under the curve ( AUC 0 - infinity ) of ixabepilone AUC increased by : • 22 % in patients with mild hepatic impairment [ a ) bilirubin > 1 to 1 . 5 x ULN and AST < ULN or b ) AST > ULN but bilirubin < 1 . 5 x ULN ] ; • 30 % in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 x ULN and any AST level ) ; • 81 % in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any AST level ) .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors on IXEMPRA : Coadministration of ixabepilone with ketoconazole , a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , increased ixabepilone AUC by 79 % compared to ixabepilone treatment alone .
Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on IXEMPRA : Coadministration of IXEMPRA with rifampin , a strong CYP3A4 inducer , decreased ixabepilone AUC by 43 % compared to IXEMPRA treatment alone .
Capecitabine : In patients with cancer who received ixabepilone ( 40 mg / m 2 ) in combination with capecitabine decreased ( 1000 mg / m 2 ) , ixabepilone Cmax decreased by 19 % and capecitabine Cmax decreased by 27 % , and 5 - fluorouracil AUC increased by 14 % ; as compared to ixabepilone or capecitabine administered separately .
In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) Enzymes : In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that clinically relevant concentrations of ixabepilone do not inhibit CYP3A4 , CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP2D6 .
Ixabepilone does not induce the activity or the corresponding mRNA levels of CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , or CYP3A4 in cultured human hepatocytes at clinically relevant concentrations .
Transporter Systems : Ixabepilone is a substrate of P - gp but is not a substrate of BCRP .
Ixabepilone is an inhibitor of P - gp for the drug efflux transporter P ‑ glycoprotein ( P - gp ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with ixabepilone have not been conducted .
Ixabepilone did not induce mutations in the microbial mutagenesis ( Ames ) assay and was not clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic assay using primary human lymphocytes .
Ixabepilone was clastogenic ( induction of micronuclei ) in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay at doses ≥ 0 . 625 mg / kg / day .
There were no effects on male or female rat mating or fertility at doses up to 0 . 2 mg / kg / day in both males and females ( approximately 0 . 1 times the expected human clinical exposure based on AUC ) .
The effect of ixabepilone on human fertility is unknown .
However , when rats were given an IV infusion of ixabepilone during breeding and through the first 7 days of gestation , a significant increase in resorptions and pre - and post - implantation loss and a decrease in the number of corpora lutea was observed at 0 . 2 mg / kg / day .
Testicular atrophy or degeneration was observed in 6 - month rat and 9 - month dog studies when ixabepilone was given every 21 days at intravenous doses of 6 . 7 mg / kg ( 40 mg / m 2 ) in rats ( approximately 2 . 1 times the expected clinical exposure based on AUC ) and 0 . 5 and 0 . 75 mg / kg ( 10 and 15 mg / m 2 ) in dogs ( approximately 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 times the expected clinical exposure based on AUC ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Overdosage In rats , single intravenous doses of ixabepilone from 60 to 180 mg / m 2 ( mean AUC values ≥ 8156 ng · h / mL ) were associated with mortality occurring between 5 and 14 days after dosing , and toxicity was principally manifested in the gastrointestinal , hematopoietic ( bone - marrow ) , lymphatic , peripheral - nervous , and male - reproductive systems .
In dogs , a single intravenous dose of 100 mg / m 2 ( mean AUC value of 6925 ng · h / mL ) was markedly toxic , inducing severe gastrointestinal toxicity and death 3 days after dosing .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Combination Therapy In an open - label , multicenter , multinational , randomized trial of 752 patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer , the efficacy and safety of IXEMPRA ( 40 mg / m 2 every 3 weeks ) in combination with capecitabine ( at 1000 mg / m 2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1 week rest ) were assessed in comparison with capecitabine as a single agent ( at 1250 mg / m 2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1 week rest ) .
Patients were previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes .
Patients were required to have demonstrated tumor progression or resistance to taxanes and anthracyclines as follows : • tumor progression within 3 months of the last anthracycline dose in the metastatic setting or recurrence within 6 months in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting , and • tumor progression within 4 months of the last taxane dose in the metastatic setting or recurrence within 12 months in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting .
For anthracyclines , patients who received a minimum cumulative dose of 240 mg / m 2 of doxorubicin or 360 mg / m 2 of epirubicin were also eligible .
In this study , the median age of patients was 53 years , 67 % were White , 23 % were Asian , and 3 % were Black ; Karnofsky performance status was 70 - 100 % , and 75 % had received prior adjuvant or neo - adjuvant chemotherapy .
Tumors were ER - positive in 47 % of patients , ER - negative in 43 % , HER2 - positive in 15 % , HER2 - negative in 61 % , and ER - negative , PR - negative , HER2 - negative in 25 % .
The baseline disease characteristics and previous therapies for all patients ( n = 752 ) are shown in Table 6 .
Table 6 : Baseline Disease Characteristics and Previous TherapiesaFor IXEMPRA plus capecitabine versus capecitabine only , prior treatment in the metastatic setting included cyclophosphamide ( 25 % vs . 23 % ) , fluorouracil ( 22 % vs . 16 % ) , vinorelbine ( 11 % vs . 12 % ) , gemcitabine ( 9 % each arm ) , carboplatin ( 9 % vs . 7 % ) , liposomal doxorubicin ( 3 % each arm ) , and cisplatin ( 2 % vs . 3 % ) .
b Tumor progression within 3 months in the metastatic setting or recurrence within 6 months in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting .

The major efficacy outcome measures of the study was progression - free survival ( PFS ) defined as time from randomization to radiologic progression as determined by Independent Radiologic Review ( IRR ) , clinical progression of measurable skin lesions or death from any cause .
Additional efficacy outcome measures included objective tumor response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , response duration , and overall survival .
IXEMPRA in combination with capecitabine resulted in a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to capecitabine .
The results of the study are presented in Table 7 and Figure 1 .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] IXEMPRA as a Single Agent IXEMPRA was evaluated as a single agent in a multicenter single - arm study in 126 women with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer .
The study enrolled patients whose tumors had recurred or had progressed following two or more chemotherapy regimens including an anthracycline , a taxane , and capecitabine .
Patients who had received a minimum cumulative dose of 240 mg / m 2 of doxorubicin or 360 mg / m 2 of epirubicin were also eligible .
Tumor progression or recurrence were prospectively defined as follows : • Disease progression while on therapy in the metastatic setting ( defined as progression while on treatment or within 8 weeks of last dose ) , • Recurrence within 6 months of the last dose in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting ( only for anthracycline and taxane ) , • HER2 - positive patients must also have progressed during or after discontinuation of trastuzumab .
In this study , the median age was 51 years ( range , 30 - 78 ) , and 79 % were White , 5 % Black , and 2 % Asian , Kamofsky performance status was 70 - 100 % , 88 % had received two or more prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease , and 86 % had liver and / or lung metastases .
Tumors were ER - positive in 48 % of patients , ER - negative in 44 % , HER2 - positive in 7 % , HER2 - negative in 72 % , and ER - negative , PR - negative , HER2 - negative in 33 % .
IXEMPRA was administered at a dose of 40 mg / m 2 intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks .
Patients received a median of 4 cycles ( range 1 to 18 ) of IXEMPRA therapy .
Objective tumor response was determined by independent radiologic and investigator review using RECIST .
Efficacy results are presented in Table 8 .

Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your liver function : • before you begin receiving IXEMPRA • as needed while you are receiving IXEMPRA If blood tests show that you have liver problems , do not receive injections of IXEMPRA along with the medicine capecitabine .
Taking these two medicines together if you have liver problems increases your chance of serious problems .
These include serious infection and death due to a very low white blood cell count ( neutropenia ) .
What is IXEMPRA ?
IXEMPRA is used alone or with another cancer medicine called capecitabine to treat locally advanced breast cancer or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body ( metastatic ) , when certain other medicines have not worked or no longer work .
It is not known if IXEMPRA is safe and effective in children .
Do not receive IXEMPRA if you : • have low white blood cell or platelet counts .
Your healthcare provider will check your blood counts .
• are allergic to a medicine , such as TAXOL ® , that contains Cremophor ® EL or polyoxyethylated castor oil ..
• are also taking a cancer medicine called capecitabine and you have liver problems .
