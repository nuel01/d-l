DESCRIPTION : KERALYT ® shampoo contains 6 % w / w salicylic acid USP in a vehicle composed of purified water , ammonium lauryl sulfosuccinate , cocamidopropyl betaine , hexylene glycol , linoleamidopropyl PG - dimonium chloride phosphate , polyquaternium - 22 , propylene glycol , sodium C14 - 16 olefin sulfonate , sodium citrate , sodium lauroyl sarcosinate , tetrasodium EDTA , tocopherol acetate and fragrance .
Salicylic acid is the 2 hydroxy derivative of benzoic acid CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Salicylic acid has been shown to produce desquamation of the horny layer of skin while not affecting qualitative or quantitative changes in structure of the viable epidermis .
¹ , ² The mechanism of action has been attributed to a dissolution of intercellular cement substance .
³ In a study of the percutaneous absorption of salicylic acid in four patients with extensive active psoriasis , Taylor and Halprin ⁴ showed that peak serum salicylate levels never exceeded 5 mg / 100 ml even though more than 60 % of the applied salicylic acid was absorbed .
Systemic toxic reactions are usually associated with much higher serum levels ( 30 to 40 mg / 100 ml ) .
Peak serum levels occurred within 5 hours of the topical application under occlusion .
The sites were occluded for 10 hours over the entire body surface below the neck .
Since salicylates are distributed in the extracellular space , patients with a contracted extracellular space due to dehydration or diuretics have higher salicylate levels than those with a normal extracellular space .
⁵ ( See PRECAUTIONS ) .
The major metabolites identified in the urine after topical administration are salicyluric acid ( 52 % ) , salicylate glucuronides ( 42 % ) , and free salicylic acid ( 6 % ) .
⁴ The urinary metabolites after percutaneous absorption differ from those after oral salicylate administration ; those derived from percutaneous absorption contain more glucuronides and less salicyluric and salicylic acid .
Almost 95 % of a single dose of salicylate is excreted within 24 hours of its entrance into the extracellular space .
⁵ Fifty to eighty percent of salicylate is protein bound to albumin .
Salicylates compete with the binding of several drugs and can modify the action of these drugs .
By similar competitive mechanisms other drugs can influence the serum levels of salicylate .
⁵ ( See PRECAUTIONS ) .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE - For the removal of excess keratin in hyperkeratotic disorders , including scaling associated with scalp psoriasis or thickened skin of palms and soles , corns and calluses .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : KERALYT SHAMPOO should not be used in any patient known to be sensitive to salicylic acid or any other listed ingredient .
KERALYT SHAMPOO should not be used in children under 2 years of age .
WARNINGS : Prolonged use over large areas , especially in children and those patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment , could result in salicylism .
Concomitant use of other drugs which may contribute to elevated serum salicylate levels should be avoided where the potential for toxicity is present .
In children under 12 years of age and those patients with renal or hepatic impairment , the area to be treated should be limited and the patient monitored closely for signs of salicylate toxicity : nausea , vomiting , dizziness , loss of hearing , tinnitus , lethargy , hyperpnoea , diarrhea , psychic disturbances .
In the event of salicylic acid toxicity , the use of KERALYT SHAMPOO should be discontinued .
Fluids should be administered to promote urinary excretion .
Treat - ment with sodium bicarbonate ( oral or intravenous ) should be instituted as appropriate .
Considering the potential risk of developing Reye ’ s Syndrome , salicylate products should not be administered to children or teenagers with varicella or influenza , unless directed by a physician .
PRECAUTIONS : For external use only .
Avoid contact with eyes and other mucous membranes .
Mild burning or stinging may occur .
Peeling of the skin may increase as the salicylic acid works to loosen excess keratin .
If excessive burning , stinging or peeling occurs , discontinue use and consult your physician .
Keep this and all medications out of reach of children .
Drug Interactions .
( The following interactions are from a published review ⁵ and include reports concerning both oral and topical salicylate administration .
The relationship of these interactions to the use of KERALYT SHAMPOO is not known . )
I . Due to the competition of salicylate with other drugs for binding to serum albumin the following drug interactions may occur : Drug Description of Interaction Tolbutamide ; Sulfonylureas Hypoglycemia potentiated Methotrexate Decreases tubular reabsorption ; clinical toxicity from methotrexate can result Oral Anticoagulant Increased bleeding II .
Drugs changing salicylate levels by altering renal tubular reabsorption : Drug Description Corticosteroids Decreases plasma salicylate level ; Tapering doses of steroids may promote salicylism Ammonium Sulfate Increases plasma salicylate level III .
Drugs with complicated interactions with salicylates : Drug Description Heparin Salicylate decreases platelet adhesiveness and interferes with hemostasis in heparin - treated patients Pyrazinamide Inhibits pyrazinamide - induced hyperuricemia Uricosuric Agents Effect of probenecid , sulfinpyrazone and phenylbutazone inhibited The following alterations of laboratory tests have been reported during salicylate therapy ⁶ : Laboratory Tests Effect of Salicylates Thyroid Function Decreased PBI ; increased T 3 uptake Urinary Sugar False negative with glucose oxidase ; false positive with Clinitest with high - dose salicylate therapy ( 2 - 5 g qd ) 5 Hydroxyindole acetic acid False negative with fluorometric test Acetone , Ketone Bodies False positive FeCl 3 in Gerhardt reaction ; red color persists with boiling 17 - OH corticosteroids False reduced values with > 4 . 8 g qd salicylate Vanilmandelic Acid False reduced values Uric Acid May increase or decrease depending on dose Prothrombin Decreased levels ; slightly increased prothrombin time Pregnancy ( Category C ) : Salicylic acid has been shown to be teratogenic in rats and monkeys .
It is difficult to extrapolate from oral doses of acetyl salicylic acid used in these studies to topical administration as the oral dose to monkeys may represent 4 times the maximum daily human dose of salicylic acid ( as supplied in one bottle , 8 oz .
of KERALYT SHAMPOO ) when applied topically over a large body surface .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
KERALYT SHAMPOO should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers : Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the mother ’ s use of KERALYT SHAMPOO , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
If used by nursing mothers , it should not be in the chest area in order to avoid accidental exposure to a nursing child .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : No data are available concerning potential carcinogenic or reproductive effects of KERALYT SHAMPOO .
It has been shown to lack mutagenic potential in the Ames Salmonella test .
ADVERSE REACTIONS : Excessive erythema and scaling conceivably could result from use on open skin lesions .
OVERDOSAGE - See WARNINGS DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For use as a concentrated scalp treatment BEFORE bathing : Do not wet hair .
Twist open applicator tip and apply KERALYT SHAMPOO w / applicator evenly , directly to affected areas of the scalp .
Leave on for 5 minutes , gradually increasing treatment time up to one hour , or as directed by physician .
Wash hands after applying KERALYT SHAMPOO w / applicator .
After treatment , rinse thoroughly with water .
Although no additional shampoo is needed to cleanse hair , a non - medicated shampoo may be used if desired .
For use as a medicated shampoo : Wet hair and apply KERALYT SHAMPOO w / applicator to the scalp .
Work into a lather , leave on for several minutes , then rinse .
Use daily until the condition clears .
After clearing is apparent , use KERALYT SHAMPOO w / applicator occasionally to maintain clearing or as directed by your physician .
