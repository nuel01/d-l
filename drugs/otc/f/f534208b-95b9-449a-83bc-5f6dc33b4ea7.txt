See Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) .
5 . 2 Nausea Patients taking Amitiza may experience nausea .
If this occurs , concomitant administration of food with Amitiza may reduce symptoms of nausea .
See Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) .
5 . 3 Diarrhea Amitiza should not be prescribed to patients that have severe diarrhea .
Patients should be aware of the possible occurrence of diarrhea during treatment .
Patients should be instructed to inform their physician if severe diarrhea occurs .
See Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) .
5 . 4 Dyspnea In clinical trials conducted to study Amitiza in treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and IBS - C there were reports of dyspnea .
This was reported at 2 . 5 % of the treated chronic idiopathic constipation population and at 0 . 4 % in the treated IBS - C population .
Although not classified as serious adverse events , some patients discontinued treatment on study because of this event .
There have been postmarketing reports of dyspnea when using Amitiza 24 mcg .
Most have not been characterized as serious adverse events , but some patients have discontinued therapy because of dyspnea .
These events have usually been described as a sensation of chest tightness and difficulty taking in a breath , and generally have an acute onset within 30 – 60 minutes after taking the first dose .
They generally resolve within a few hours after taking the dose , but recurrence has been frequently reported with subsequent doses .
5 . 5 Bowel Obstruction In patients with symptoms suggestive of mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction , the treating physician should perform a thorough evaluation to confirm the absence of such an obstruction prior to initiating therapy with Amitiza .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Enter section text here • Most common adverse reactions ( incidence > 4 % ) in chronic idiopathic constipation are nausea , diarrhea , headache , abdominal pain , abdominal distension , and flatulence ( 6 . 1 ) • Most common adverse reactions ( incidence > 4 % ) in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation are nausea , diarrhea , and abdominal pain ( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America , Inc . , at 1 - 877 - 825 - 3327 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Chronic Idiopathic Constipation Adverse reactions in dose - finding , efficacy , and long - term clinical studies : The data described below reflect exposure to Amitiza in 1175 patients with chronic idiopathic constipation ( 29 at 24 mcg once daily , 1113 at 24 mcg twice daily , and 33 at 24 mcg three times daily ) over 3 - or 4 - week , 6 - month , and 12 - month treatment periods ; and from 316 patients receiving placebo over short - term exposure ( less than or equal to 4 weeks ) .
The total population ( N = 1491 ) had a mean age of 49 . 7 ( range 19 – 86 ) years ; was 87 . 1 % female ; 84 . 8 % Caucasian , 8 . 5 % African American , 5 . 0 % Hispanic , 0 . 9 % Asian ; and 15 . 5 % elderly ( greater than or equal to 65 years of age ) .
Table 1 presents data for the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1 % of patients who received Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily and that occurred more frequently with study drug than placebo .
In addition , corresponding adverse reaction incidences in patients receiving Amitiza 24 mcg once daily is shown .

2 This term combines " abdominal tenderness , " " abdominal rigidity , " " gastrointestinal discomfort , " and " abdominal discomfort . "
Nausea : Approximately 29 % of patients who received Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily experienced an adverse reaction of nausea ; 4 % of patients had severe nausea while 9 % of patients discontinued treatment due to nausea .
The rate of nausea associated with Amitiza ( any dosage ) was substantially lower among male ( 7 % ) and elderly patients ( 18 % ) .
Further analysis of the safety data revealed that long - term exposure to Amitiza does not appear to place patients at an elevated risk for experiencing nausea .
The incidence of nausea increased in a dose - dependent manner with the lowest overall incidence for nausea reported at the 24 mcg once daily dosage ( 17 % ) .
In open - labeled , long - term studies , patients were allowed to adjust the dosage of Amitiza down to 24 mcg once daily from 24 mcg twice daily if experiencing nausea .
Nausea decreased when Amitiza was administered with food .
No patients in the clinical studies were hospitalized due to nausea .
Diarrhea : Approximately 12 % of patients who received Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily experienced an adverse reaction of diarrhea ; 2 % of patients had severe diarrhea while 2 % of patients discontinued treatment due to diarrhea .
Electrolytes : No serious adverse reactions of electrolyte imbalance were reported in clinical studies , and no clinically significant changes were seen in serum electrolyte levels in patients receiving Amitiza .
Less common adverse reactions : The following adverse reactions ( assessed by investigator as probably or definitely related to treatment ) occurred in less than 1 % of patients receiving Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily in clinical studies , occurred in at least two patients , and occurred more frequently in patients receiving study drug than those receiving placebo : fecal incontinence , muscle cramp , defecation urgency , frequent bowel movements , hyperhidrosis , pharyngolaryngeal pain , intestinal functional disorder , anxiety , cold sweat , constipation , cough , dysgeusia , eructation , influenza , joint swelling , myalgia , pain , syncope , tremor , decreased appetite .
Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation Adverse reactions in dose - finding , efficacy , and long - term clinical studies : The data described below reflect exposure to Amitiza 8 mcg twice daily in 1011 patients with IBS - C for up to 12 months and from 435 patients receiving placebo twice daily for up to 16 weeks .
The total population ( N = 1267 ) had a mean age of 46 . 5 ( range 18 – 85 ) years ; was 91 . 6 % female ; 77 . 5 % Caucasian , 12 . 9 % African American , 8 . 6 % Hispanic , 0 . 4 % Asian ; and 8 . 0 % elderly ( greater than or equal to 65 years of age ) .
Table 2 presents data for the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1 % of patients who received Amitiza 8 mcg twice daily and that occurred more frequently with study drug than placebo .
Table 2 : Percent of Patients with Adverse Reactions ( IBS - C Studies ) System / Adverse Reaction1 Placebo N = 435 % Amitiza 8 mcg Twice Daily N = 1011 % Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea 4 8 Diarrhea 4 7 Abdominal pain 5 5 Abdominal distension 2 3 1 Includes only those events associated with treatment ( possibly or probably related , as assessed by the investigator ) .
Less common adverse reactions : The following adverse reactions ( assessed by investigator as probably related to treatment ) occurred in less than 1 % of patients receiving Amitiza 8 mcg twice daily in clinical studies , occurred in at least two patients , and occurred more frequently in patients receiving study drug than those receiving placebo : dyspepsia , loose stools , vomiting , fatigue , dry mouth , edema , increased alanine aminotransferase , increased aspartate aminotransferase , constipation , eructation , gastroesophageal reflux disease , dyspnea , erythema , gastritis , increased weight , palpitations , urinary tract infection , anorexia , anxiety , depression , fecal incontinence , fibromyalgia , hard feces , lethargy , rectal hemorrhage , pollakiuria .
One open - labeled , long - term clinical study was conducted in patients with IBS - C receiving Amitiza 8 mcg twice daily .
This study comprised 476 intent - to - treat patients ( mean age 47 . 5 [ range 21 – 82 ] years ; 93 . 5 % female ; 79 . 2 % Caucasian , 11 . 6 % African American , 8 . 6 % Hispanic , 0 . 2 % Asian ; 7 . 8 % greater than or equal to 65 years of age ) who were treated for an additional 36 weeks following an initial 12 – 16 - week , double - blinded treatment period .
The adverse reactions that were reported during this study were similar to those observed in the two double - blinded , controlled studies .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of Amitiza 24 mcg for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Voluntary reports of adverse reactions occurring with the use of Amitiza include the following : syncope , allergic - type reactions ( including rash , swelling , and throat tightness ) , malaise , increased heart rate , muscle cramps or muscle spasms , rash , and asthenia .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Based upon the results of in vitro human microsome studies , there is low likelihood of drug – drug interactions .
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the metabolism of lubiprostone .
Further in vitro studies indicate microsomal carbonyl reductase may be involved in the extensive biotransformation of lubiprostone to the metabolite M3 ( See Pharmacokinetics [ 12 . 3 ] . )
.
Additionally , in vitro studies in human liver microsomes demonstrate that lubiprostone does not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoforms 3A4 , 2D6 , 1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , or 2E1 , and in vitro studies of primary cultures of human hepatocytes show no induction of cytochrome P450 isoforms 1A2 , 2B6 , 2C9 , and 3A4 by lubiprostone .
No drug – drug interaction studies have been performed .
Based on the available information , no protein binding – mediated drug interactions of clinical significance are anticipated .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Enter section text here 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic effects : Pregnancy Category C . [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) . ]
Teratology studies with lubiprostone have been conducted in rats at oral doses up to 2000 mcg / kg / day ( approximately 332 times the recommended human dose , based on body surface area ) , and in rabbits at oral doses of up to 100 mcg / kg / day ( approximately 33 times the recommended human dose , based on body surface area ) .
Lubiprostone was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits .
In guinea pigs , lubiprostone caused fetal loss at repeated doses of 10 and 25 mcg / kg / day ( approximately 2 and 6 times the highest recommended human dose , respectively , based on body surface area ) administered on days 40 to 53 of gestation .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
However , during clinical testing of Amitiza , six women became pregnant .
Per protocol , Amitiza was discontinued upon pregnancy detection .
Four of the six women delivered healthy babies .
The fifth woman was monitored for 1 month following discontinuation of study drug , at which time the pregnancy was progressing as expected ; the patient was subsequently lost to follow - up .
The sixth pregnancy was electively terminated .
Amitiza should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking the drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether lubiprostone is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from lubiprostone , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been studied .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Chronic Idiopathic Constipation The efficacy of Amitiza in the elderly ( ≥ 65 years of age ) subpopulation was consistent with the efficacy in the overall study population .
Of the total number of constipated patients treated in the dose - finding , efficacy , and long - term studies of Amitiza , 15 . 5 % were ≥ 65 years of age , and 4 . 2 % were ≥ 75 years of age .
Elderly patients taking Amitiza ( any dosage ) experienced a lower incidence rate of associated nausea compared to the overall study population taking Amitiza ( 18 % vs . 29 % , respectively ) .
Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation The safety profile of Amitiza in the elderly ( ≥ 65 years of age ) subpopulation ( 8 . 0 % were ≥ 65 years of age and 1 . 8 % were ≥ 75 years of age ) was consistent with the safety profile in the overall study population .
Clinical studies of Amitiza did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Amitiza has not been studied in patients who have renal impairment .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Amitiza has not been studied in patients who have hepatic impairment .
10 OVERDOSAGE There have been two confirmed reports of overdosage with Amitiza .
The first report involved a 3 - year - old child who accidentally ingested 7 or 8 capsules of 24 mcg of Amitiza and fully recovered .
The second report was a study patient who self - administered a total of 96 mcg of Amitiza per day for 8 days .
The patient experienced no adverse reactions during this time .
Additionally , in a Phase 1 cardiac repolarization study , 38 of 51 patients given a single oral dose of 144 mcg of Amitiza ( 6 times the highest recommended dose ) experienced an adverse event that was at least possibly related to the study drug .
Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1 % of these patients included the following : nausea ( 45 % ) , diarrhea ( 35 % ) , vomiting ( 27 % ) , dizziness ( 14 % ) , headache ( 12 % ) , abdominal pain ( 8 % ) , flushing / hot flash ( 8 % ) , retching ( 8 % ) , dyspnea ( 4 % ) , pallor ( 4 % ) , stomach discomfort ( 4 % ) , anorexia ( 2 % ) , asthenia ( 2 % ) , chest discomfort ( 2 % ) , dry mouth ( 2 % ) , hyperhidrosis ( 2 % ) , and syncope ( 2 % ) .
11 DESCRIPTION Amitiza ( lubiprostone ) is chemically designated as ( – ) - 7 - [ ( 2 R , 4 aR , 5 R , 7 aR ) - 2 - ( 1 , 1 - difluoropentyl ) - 2 - hydroxy - 6 - oxooctahydrocyclopenta [ b ] pyran - 5 - yl ] heptanoic acid .
The molecular formula of lubiprostone is C20H32F2O5 with a molecular weight of 390 . 46 and a chemical structure as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Lubiprostone drug substance occurs as white , odorless crystals or crystalline powder , is very soluble in ether and ethanol , and is practically insoluble in hexane and water .
Amitiza is available as an imprinted , oval , soft gelatin capsule in two strengths .
Pink capsules contain 8 mcg of lubiprostone and the following inactive ingredients : medium - chain triglycerides , gelatin , sorbitol , ferric oxide , titanium dioxide , and purified water .
Orange capsules contain 24 mcg of lubiprostone and the following inactive ingredients : medium - chain triglycerides , gelatin , sorbitol , FD & C Red # 40 , D & C Yellow # 10 , and purified water .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Enter section text here 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Lubiprostone is a locally acting chloride channel activator that enhances a chloride - rich intestinal fluid secretion without altering sodium and potassium concentrations in the serum .
Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC - 2 , which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine , in a protein kinase A – independent fashion .
By increasing intestinal fluid secretion , lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine , thereby facilitating the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation .
Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical ( luminal ) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium .
Additionally , activation of ClC - 2 by lubiprostone has been shown to stimulate recovery of mucosal barrier function via the restoration of tight junction protein complexes in ex vivo studies of ischemic porcine intestine .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Although the pharmacologic effects of lubiprostone in humans have not been fully evaluated , animal studies have shown that oral administration of lubiprostone increases chloride ion transport into the intestinal lumen , enhances fluid secretion into the bowels , and improves fecal transit .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Lubiprostone has low systemic availability following oral administration and concentrations of lubiprostone in plasma are below the level of quantitation ( 10 pg / mL ) .
Therefore , standard pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve ( AUC ) , maximum concentration ( Cmax ) , and half - life ( t ½ ) cannot be reliably calculated .
However , the pharmacokinetic parameters of M3 ( only measurable active metabolite of lubiprostone ) have been characterized .
Gender has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of M3 following the oral administration of lubiprostone .
Absorption Concentrations of lubiprostone in plasma are below the level of quantitation ( 10 pg / mL ) because lubiprostone has a low systemic availability following oral administration .
Peak plasma levels of M3 , after a single oral dose with 24 mcg of lubiprostone , occurred at approximately 1 . 10 hours .
The Cmax was 41 . 5 pg / mL and the mean AUC0 – t was 57 . 1 pg ∙ hr / mL .
The AUC0 – t of M3 increases dose proportionally after single 24 - mcg and 144 - mcg doses of lubiprostone .
Distribution In vitro protein binding studies indicate lubiprostone is approximately 94 % bound to human plasma proteins .
Studies in rats given radiolabeled lubiprostone indicate minimal distribution beyond the gastrointestinal tissues .
Concentrations of radiolabeled lubiprostone at 48 hours post - administration were minimal in all tissues of the rats .
Metabolism The results of both human and animal studies indicate that lubiprostone is rapidly and extensively metabolized by 15 - position reduction , α - chain β - oxidation , and ω - chain ω - oxidation .
These biotransformations are not mediated by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system but rather appear to be mediated by the ubiquitously expressed carbonyl reductase .
M3 , a metabolite of lubiprostone found in both humans and animals , is formed by the reduction of the carbonyl group at the 15 - hydroxy moiety that consists of both α - hydroxy and β - hydroxy epimers .
M3 makes up less than 10 % of the dose of radiolabeled lubiprostone .
Animal studies have shown that metabolism of lubiprostone rapidly occurs within the stomach and jejunum , most likely in the absence of any systemic absorption .
This is presumed to be the case in humans as well .
Elimination Lubiprostone could not be detected in plasma ; however , M3 has a t ½ ranging from 0 . 9 to 1 . 4 hours .
After a single oral dose of 72 mcg of 3 H - labeled lubiprostone , 60 % of total administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine within 24 hours and 30 % of total administered radioactivity was recovered in the feces by 168 hours .
Lubiprostone and M3 are only detected in trace amounts in human feces .
Food Effect A study was conducted with a single 72 - mcg dose of 3 H - labeled lubiprostone to evaluate the potential of a food effect on lubiprostone absorption , metabolism , and excretion .
Pharmacokinetic parameters of total radioactivity demonstrated that Cmax decreased by 55 % while AUC0 –∞ was unchanged when lubiprostone was administered with a high - fat meal .
The clinical relevance of the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of lubiprostone is not clear .
However , lubiprostone was administered with food and water in a majority of clinical trials .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Enter section text here 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Two 2 - year oral ( gavage ) carcinogenicity studies ( one in Crl : B6C3F1 mice and one in Sprague - Dawley rats ) were conducted with lubiprostone .
In the 2 - year carcinogenicity study in mice , lubiprostone doses of 25 , 75 , 200 , and 500 mcg / kg / day ( approximately 2 , 6 , 17 , and 42 times the highest recommended human dose , respectively , based on body surface area ) were used .
In the 2 - year rat carcinogenicity study , lubiprostone doses of 20 , 100 , and 400 mcg / kg / day ( approximately 3 , 17 , and 68 times the highest recommended human dose , respectively , based on body surface area ) were used .
In the mouse carcinogenicity study , there was no significant increase in any tumor incidences .
There was a significant increase in the incidence of interstitial cell adenoma of the testes in male rats at the 400 mcg / kg / day dose .
In female rats , treatment with lubiprostone produced hepatocellular adenoma at the 400 mcg / kg / day dose .
Mutagenesis Lubiprostone was not genotoxic in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay , the in vitro mouse lymphoma ( L5178Y TK + / – ) forward mutation assay , the in vitro Chinese hamster lung ( CHL / IU ) chromosomal aberration assay , and the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility Lubiprostone , at oral doses of up to 1000 mcg / kg / day , had no effect on the fertility and reproductive function of male and female rats .
However , the number of implantation sites and live embryos were significantly reduced in rats at the 1000 mcg / kg / day dose as compared to control .
The number of dead or resorbed embryos in the 1000 mcg / kg / day group was higher compared to the control group , but was not statistically significant .
The 1000 mcg / kg / day dose in rats is approximately 166 times the highest recommended human dose of 48 mcg / day , based on body surface area .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Chronic Idiopathic ConstipationDose - finding Study A dose - finding , double - blinded , parallel - group , placebo - controlled , Phase 2 study was conducted in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation .
Following a 2 - week baseline / washout period , patients ( N = 127 ) were randomized to receive placebo ( n = 33 ) , Amitiza 24 mcg / day ( 24 mcg once daily ; n = 29 ) , Amitiza 48 mcg / day ( 24 mcg twice daily ; n = 32 ) , or Amitiza 72 mcg / day ( 24 mcg three times daily ; n = 33 ) for 3 weeks .
Patients were chosen for participation based on their need for relief of constipation , which was defined as less than 3 spontaneous bowel movements ( SBMs ) per week .
The primary efficacy variable was the daily average number of SBMs .
The study demonstrated that all patients who took Amitiza experienced a noticeable improvement in clinical response .
Based on the efficacy analysis , there was no statistically significant improvement in the clinical response beyond a total daily dose of 24 mcg during treatment weeks 2 and 3 ( Figure 1 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 1 : Weekly Mean ( ± Standard Error ) Spontaneous Bowel Movements ( Dose - finding Study ) Efficacy Studies Two double - blinded , placebo - controlled studies of identical design were conducted in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation .
Chronic idiopathic constipation was defined as , on average , less than 3 SBMs per week along with one or more of the following symptoms of constipation for at least 6 months prior to randomization : 1 ) very hard stools for at least a quarter of all bowel movements ; 2 ) sensation of incomplete evacuation following at least a quarter of all bowel movements ; and 3 ) straining with defecation at least a quarter of the time .
Following a 2 - week baseline / washout period , a total of 479 patients ( mean age 47 . 2 [ range 20 – 81 ] years ; 88 . 9 % female ; 80 . 8 % Caucasian , 9 . 6 % African American , 7 . 3 % Hispanic , 1 . 5 % Asian ; 10 . 9 % ≥ 65 years of age ) were randomized and received Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily ( 48 mcg / day ) or placebo twice daily for 4 weeks .
The primary endpoint of the studies was SBM frequency .
The studies demonstrated that patients treated with Amitiza had a higher frequency of SBMs during Week 1 than the placebo patients .
In both studies , results similar to those in Week 1 were also observed in Weeks 2 , 3 , and 4 of therapy ( Table 3 ) .

In both studies , Amitiza demonstrated increases in the percentage of patients who experienced SBMs within the first 24 hours after administration when compared to placebo ( 56 . 7 % vs . 36 . 9 % in Study 1 and 62 . 9 % vs . 31 . 9 % in Study 2 , respectively ) .
Similarly , the time to first SBM was shorter for patients receiving Amitiza than for those receiving placebo .
Signs and symptoms related to constipation , including abdominal bloating , abdominal discomfort , stool consistency , and straining , as well as constipation severity ratings , were also improved with Amitiza versus placebo .
The results were consistent in subpopulation analyses for gender , race , and elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years of age ) .
Following 4 weeks of treatment with Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily , withdrawal of Amitiza did not result in a rebound effect .
Long - term Studies Three open - labeled , long - term clinical safety and efficacy studies were conducted in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation receiving Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily .
These studies comprised 871 patients ( mean age 51 . 0 [ range 19 – 86 ] years ; 86 . 1 % female ; 86 . 9 % Caucasian , 7 . 3 % African American , 4 . 5 % Hispanic , 0 . 7 % Asian ; 18 . 4 % ≥ 65 years of age ) who were treated for 6 – 12 months ( 24 – 48 weeks ) .
Patients provided regular assessments of abdominal bloating , abdominal discomfort , and constipation severity .
These studies demonstrated that Amitiza decreased abdominal bloating , abdominal discomfort , and constipation severity over the 6 – 12 - month treatment periods .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation Efficacy Studies Two double - blinded , placebo - controlled studies of similar design were conducted in patients with IBS - C .
IBS was defined as abdominal pain or discomfort occurring over at least 6 months with two or more of the following : 1 ) relieved with defecation ; 2 ) onset associated with a change in stool frequency ; and 3 ) onset associated with a change in stool form .
Patients were sub - typed as having IBS - C if they also experienced two of three of the following : 1 ) less than 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week , 2 ) greater than 25 % hard stools , and 3 ) greater than 25 % spontaneous bowel movements associated with straining .
Following a 4 - week baseline / washout period , a total of 1154 patients ( mean age 46 . 6 [ range 18 – 85 ] years ; 91 . 6 % female ; 77 . 4 % Caucasian , 13 . 2 % African American , 8 . 5 % Hispanic , 0 . 4 % Asian ; 8 . 3 % greater than or equal to 65 years of age ) were randomized and received Amitiza 8 mcg twice daily ( 16 mcg / day ) or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks .
The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed weekly utilizing the patient ' s response to a global symptom relief question based on a 7 - point , balanced scale ( " significantly worse " to " significantly relieved " ) : " How would you rate your relief of IBS symptoms ( abdominal discomfort / pain , bowel habits , and other IBS symptoms ) over the past week compared to how you felt before you entered the study ? "
The primary efficacy analysis was a comparison of the proportion of " overall responders " in each arm .
A patient was considered an " overall responder " if the criteria for being designated a " monthly responder " were met in at least 2 of the 3 months on study .
A " monthly responder " was defined as a patient who had reported " significantly relieved " for at least 2 weeks of the month or at least " moderately relieved " in all 4 weeks of that month .
During each monthly evaluation period , patients reporting " moderately worse " or " significantly worse " relief , an increase in rescue medication use , or those who discontinued due to lack of efficacy , were deemed non - responders .
The percentage of patients in Study 1 qualifying as an " overall responder " was 13 . 8 % in the group receiving Amitiza 8 mcg twice daily compared to 7 . 8 % of patients receiving placebo twice daily .
In Study 2 , 12 . 1 % of patients in the Amitiza 8 mcg group were " overall responders " versus 5 . 7 % of patients in the placebo group .
In both studies , the treatment differences between the placebo and Amitiza groups were statistically significant .
Results in men : The two randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blinded studies comprised 97 ( 8 . 4 % ) male patients , which is insufficient to determine whether men with IBS - C respond differently to Amitiza from women .
Study 1 also assessed the rebound effect from the withdrawal of Amitiza .
Following 12 weeks of treatment with Amitiza 8 mcg twice daily , withdrawal of Amitiza did not result in a rebound effect .
