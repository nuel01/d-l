VisionBlue ® ( trypan blue ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 06 % Initial U . S . Approval : 2004 VisionBlue ® 0 . 06 % is an acid di - azo group dye indicated for use as an aid in ophthalmic surgery by staining the anterior capsule of the lens .
VisionBlue 0 . 06 % - Dosage & Administration Section Cataract surgery .
VisionBlue ® 0 . 06 % is packaged in a 2 . 25 mL syringe to which a blunt cannula has to be attached .
After opening the eye , an air bubble is injected into the anterior chamber of the eye in order to minimize dilution of VisionBlue ® 0 . 06 % by the aqeous .
VisionBlue ® 0 . 06 % is carefully applied onto the anterior lens capsule using a blunt cannula .
Sufficient staining is achieved as soon as the dye has contacted the capsule .
The anterior chamber is then irrigated with balanced salt solution to remove all excess dye .
An anterior capsulotomy can then be performed .
• Inject an air bubble into the anterior chamber ; • Carefully apply VisionBlue ® 0 . 06 % onto the lens capsule ; • Remove all excess dye from the anterior chamber .

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS contact FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch VisionBlue 0 . 06 % - Use in specific populations section Trypan blue should not be given to pregnant women .
VisionBlue 0 . 06 % - Pregnancy section Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C . Trypan blue is teratogenic in rats , mice , rabbits , hamsters , dogs , guinea pigs , pigs , and chickens .
The majority of teratogenicity studies performed involve intravenous , intraperitoneal , or subcutaneous administration in the rat .
The teratogenic dose is 50 mg / kg as a single dose or 25 mg / kg / day during embryogenesis in the rat .
These doses are approximately 10 , 000 - and 5 , 000 - fold the maximum recommended human dose of 0 . 3 mg per injection based in a 60 kg person , assuming that the whole dose is completely absorbed .
Characteristic anomalies included neural tube , cardiovascular , vertebral , tail , and eye defects .
Trypan blue also caused an increase in post - implantation mortality , and decreased fetal weight .
In the monkey , trypan blue caused abortions with single or two daily doses of 50 mg / kg between 20 th to 25 th days of pregnancy , but no apparent increase in birth defects ( approximately 10 , 000 - fold the maximum recommended human daily dose of 0 . 3 mg per injection , assuming total absorption ) .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Trypan blue should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
VisionBlue 0 . 06 % - Nursing Mothers section It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when trypan blue is administered to a nursing woman .
VisionBlue 0 . 06 % - Pediatric use section The safety and effectiveness of trypan blue have been established in pediatric patients .
Use of trypan blue is supported by evidence from an adequate and well - controlled study in pediatric patients .
VisionBlue 0 . 06 % - Geriatric use section No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
