Contraindications ( 4 ) 09 / 2021 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE OPTISON is indicated for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify the left ventricle and to improve the delineation of the left ventricular endocardial borders .
OPTISON is an ultrasound contrast agent indicated for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify the left ventricle and to improve the delineation of the left ventricular endocardial borders ( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dosage ( 2 . 1 ) • Recommended dose of OPTISON is 0 . 5 mL intravenously injected into a peripheral vein • Maximum total dose should not exceed 5 mL in any 10 minute period • Maximum total dose should not exceed 8 . 7 mL in any one patient study • If contrast enhancement is inadequate after the dose of 0 . 5 mL , additional doses of increments of 0 . 5 mL up to 5 mL in a 10 minutes period may be injected intravenously up to a maximum total dose of 8 . 7 mL Administration Instructions ( 2 . 3 ) • For intravenous injection .
Do not administer by intra - arterial injection ( 5 . 3 ) • Injection rate should not exceed 1 mL per second • Follow the OPTISON injection with a flush of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP , or 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP 2 . 1 Recommended Dosage • The recommended dose of OPTISON is 0 . 5 mL intravenously injected into a peripheral vein .
• If the contrast enhancement is inadequate after the dose of 0 . 5 mL , additional doses in increments of 0 . 5 mL may be repeated for further contrast enhancement as needed .
• The maximum total dose should not exceed 5 mL in any 10 minute period .
• The maximum total dose should not exceed 8 . 7 mL in any one patient study .
2 . 2 Preparation Instructions • Do not use if the container has been damaged , the protective seal and / or rubber cap have been entered , or the upper white layer is absent ( may indicate the microspheres have been damaged and may result in poor or no echo contrast ) .
• Invert the OPTISON vial and gently rotate to resuspend the microspheres .
This process will allow the product to come to room temperature ( 20 ° to 25 ° C or 68 ° to 77 ° F ) before use .
• Inspect the vial for complete resuspension .
Do not use if the suspension appears to be clear rather than opaque and milky - white .
• Vent the OPTISON vial with a sterile vent spike or with a sterile 18 gauge needle before withdrawing the OPTISON suspension into the injection syringe .
• Do not inject air into the vial .
• Use the product within one minute of suspension .
If one minute is exceeded , resuspend by inverting and gently rotating the microsoheres in the syringe .
Failure to adequately resuspend OPTISON may cause inadequate delivery of the microspheres , and may result in inadequate contrast .
2 . 3 Administration Instructions • Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever supension and container permit .
Do not inject if the suspension is not opaque , milky - white , and absent particulate matter .
• Inject through a 20 - gauge or larger angiocatheter into a peripheral vein at a rate not exceeding 1 mL per second .
Suggested methods of administration include : a short extension tubing , heparin lock , or intravenous line , all with a 3 - way stopcock .
• Administer intravenously ; do not administer OPTISON by intra - arterial injection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Do not aspirate blood back into the OPTISON containing syringe before administration ; this may promote the formation of a blood clot within the syringe .
• For short extension tubing or heparin lock : fill one syringe with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP , and FLUSH the line for patency before and after the injection of OPTISON .
• For a continuous intravenous line : open an intravenous line with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP ( or 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP ) at a slow infusion rate to maintain vascular patency .
Flush the line immediately after injection of OPTISON .
• Do not use the single - patient use vial for more than one patient .
Discard unused product .

The risk for these reactions may be increased among patients with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions ( acute myocardial infarction , acute coronary artery syndromes , worsening or unstable congestive heart failure , or serious ventricular arrhythmias ) .
The reported reactions to perflutren - containing microspheres include : fatal cardiac or respiratory arrest , shock , syncope , symptomatic arrhythmias ( atrial fibrillation , tachycardia , bradycardia , supraventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , ventricular tachycardia ) , hypertension , hypotension , dyspnea , hypoxia , chest pain , respiratory distress , stridor , wheezing , loss of consciousness and convulsions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available prior to OPTISON administration and monitor all patients for acute reactions .
5 . 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious anaphylactic reactions have been observed during or shortly following perflutren - containing microsphere administration including : Shock , hypersensitivity , bronchospasm , throat tightness , angioedema , edema ( pharyngeal , palatal , mouth , peripheral , localized ) , swelling ( face , eye , lip , tongue upper airway ) , facial hypoesthesia , rash , urticaria , pruritus , flushing , and erythema have occurred in patients with no prior exposure to perflutren - containing microsphere products .
Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available prior to OPTISON administration and monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 3 Systemic Embolization When administering OPTISON to patients with a cardiac shunt , microspheres can bypass filtering of the lung and enter the arterial circulation .
Assess patients with shunts for embolic phenomena following OPTISON administration .
OPTISON is only for intravenous administration ; do not administer OPTISON by intra - arterial injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 4 Ventricular Arrhythmia Related to High Mechanical Index High ultrasound mechanical index values may cause microsphere rupture and lead to ventricular arrhythmias .
Additionally , end - systolic triggering with high mechanical indices has been reported to cause ventricular arrhythmias .
OPTISON is not recommended for use at mechanical indices greater than 0 . 8 .
5 . 5 Transmissible Infectious Agents This product contains albumin , a derivative of human blood .
Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes , it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral disease .
A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) also is considered extremely remote .
No cases of transmission of viral disease or CJD have ever been identified for albumin .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no data with OPTISON use in pregnant women to inform any drug - associated risks .
No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with intravenous administration of OPTISON to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to at least 5 and 10 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ( see Data ) .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data OPTISON was administered intravenously to rats at doses of 0 . 25 , 5 and 10 mL / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 2 , 5 and 10 times the recommended maximum human dose of 8 . 7 mL , respectively , based on body surface area ) and to rabbits at 0 . 25 , 2 . 5 and 5 mL / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 5 , 5 and 10 times the recommended maximum human dose , respectively , based on body surface area ) during organogenesis .
No significant findings attributable solely to a direct effect on the fetus were detected in the studies .
8 . 2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of perflutren protein - type A microspheres in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for OPTISON and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from OPTISON or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in a clinical study of OPTISON , 35 % were 65 and over , while 14 % were 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
11 DESCRIPTION OPTISON ( perflutren protein - type A microspheres ) injectable suspension is an ultrasound contrast agent for intravenous injection .
The vial contains a clear liquid lower layer , a white liquid upper layer , and a headspace filled with perflutren gas .
After resuspension , the sterile suspension is homogeneous , opaque , and milky - white .
Perflutren is chemically characterized as 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 3 - perflutren with a molecular weight of 188 , an empirical formula of C 3 F 8 and it has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each mL of OPTISON contains 5 - 8 × 10 8 protein - type A microspheres , 10 mg albumin human , 0 . 22 ± 0 . 11 mg perflutren ; and the following excipients : 0 . 2 mg N - acetyltryptophan , and 0 . 12 mg caprylic acid in 0 . 9 % aqueous sodium chloride .
The headspace of the vial is filled with perflutren gas .
The pH is adjusted to 6 . 4 - 7 . 4 .
The protein in the microsphere shell makes up approximately 5 - 7 % ( w / w ) of the total protein in the suspension .
The microsphere particle size parameters are listed in Table 2 .
Table 2 Microsphere Particle Size ParametersMean diameter ( range ) 3 to 4 . 5 µm ( max .
32 µm ) Percent less than 10 µm 95 % [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The OPTISON microspheres create an echogenic contrast effect in the blood .
The acoustic impedance of the OPTISON microspheres is much lower than that of the blood .
Therefore , impinging ultrasound waves are scattered and reflected at the microsphere - blood interface and ultimately may be visualized in the ultrasound image .
At the frequencies used in adult echocardiography ( 2 - 5 MHz ) , the microspheres resonate which further increases the extent of ultrasound scattering and reflection .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The median duration of OPTISON contrast enhancement for each of the four doses of OPTISON , 0 . 2 ( 40 % of recommended dose ) , 0 . 5 , 3 . 0 , and 5 mL , were approximately one , two , four , and five minutes , respectively [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics After injection of OPTISON , diffusion of the perflutren gas out of the microspheres is limited by the low partition coefficient of the gas in blood that contributes to the persistence of the microspheres .
The pharmacokinetics of the intact microspheres of OPTISON in humans are unknown .
Distribution The binding of perflutren to plasma proteins and its partitioning into blood cells are unknown .
However , perflutren protein binding is expected to be minimal due to the low partition coefficient of the gas in blood .
Elimination Following intravenous injection , perflutren is cleared with a pulmonary elimination half - life of 1 . 3 ± 0 . 69 minutes ( mean ± SD ) .
Metabolism Perflutren is a stable gas that is not metabolized .
The human albumin component of the microsphere is expected to be handled by the normal metabolic routes .
Excretion Perflutren is eliminated through the lungs within 10 minutes .
The mean ± SD recovery was 96 % ± 23 % .
The perflutren concentration in expired air peaked approximately 30 - 40 seconds after administration .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Animal studies were not carried out to determine the carcinogenic potential of OPTISON .
Mutagenesis The result of the following genotoxicity studies with OPTISON were negative : 1 ) Salmonella / Escherichia coli reverse mutation assay , 2 ) in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary cells ( CHO ) with and without metabolic activation , 3 ) CHO / HGPRT forward mutation assay , and 4 ) in vivo mammalian micronucleus assay .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Echocardiography The efficacy of OPTISON was evaluated in two identical multicenter , controlled , dose escalation studies of 203 patients ( Study A : n = 101 , Study B : n = 102 ) with sub - optimal non - contrast echocardiography defined as having at least two out of six segments of the left ventricular endocardial border inadequately delineated in the apical four - chamber view .
Among these patients there were 79 % men , 21 % women , 64 % White , 25 % Black , 10 % Hispanic , and 1 % other race or ethnic group .
The patients had a mean age of 61 years ( range : 21 to 83 years ) , a mean weight of 196 lbs .
( range : 117 to 342 lbs . )
, a mean height of 68 inches ( range : 47 to 78 inches ) , and a mean body surface area of 2 . 0 m 2 ( range : 1 . 4 to 2 . 6 m 2 ) .
Approximately 23 % of the patients had chronic pulmonary disease , and 17 % had congestive and dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fractions ( LVEFs ) of between 20 % and 40 % ( by previous echocardiography ) .
Patients with a LVEF of less than 20 % or with New York Heart Association Class IV heart failure were not included in the studies .
After non - contrast imaging , OPTISON was administered in increasing increments as 4 doses ( 0 . 2 , 0 . 5 , 3 . 0 and 5 mL ) with at least ten minutes between each dose .
Ultrasound settings were optimized for the baseline ( non - contrast ) apical four - chamber view and remained unchanged for the contrast imaging .
Static echocardiographic images and video - tape segments were interpreted by a reader who was blinded to the patient ' s clinical history and to the dose of OPTISON .
Left ventricular endocardial border delineation and left ventricular opacification , were assessed before and after OPTISON administration by the measurement of visualized endocardial border length and ventricular opacification .
In comparison to non - contrast ultrasound , OPTISON significantly increased the length of endocardial border that could be visualized both at end - systole and end - diastole ( see Table 3 ) .
In these patients there was a trend towards less visualization in women .
OPTISON increased left ventricular opacification ( peak intensity ) in the mid - chamber and apical views ( see Table 4 ) .
The imaging effects of OPTISON on endocardial border delineation and left ventricular opacification were similar at doses between 0 . 5 mL and 5 mL and were also similar among patients with or without pulmonary disease and dilated cardiomyopathy .
