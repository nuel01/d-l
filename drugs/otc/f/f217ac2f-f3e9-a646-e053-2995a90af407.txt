Contraindications Due to lead content , STERITALC ® is contraindicated in pregnant women and can cause fetal harm and potential loss of pregnancy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 .
Warnings and Precautions 5 . 1 Pneumonitis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) Acute Pneumonitis and ARDS , including fatal cases , have been reported with intrapleural use of various talc products .
Systemic exposure of talc could be affected by the integrity of the visceral pleura and could be increased if talc is administered immediately after mechanical abrasion or biopsy of the pleura .
The literature also suggests a possible correlation between talc particle size distribution and risk of toxicity .
There are published reports of two large , prospective trials conducted to evaluate the safety of STERITALC administered intrapleurally .
One trial evaluated 558 patients treated with STERITALC 4 g by poudrage for MPE .
The second trial evaluated 418 patients with recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax treated with STERITALC 2 g by poudrage .
No cases of ARDS or talc - related lung injury were reported .
5 . 2 Interference with Future Procedures Sclerosis of the pleural space may preclude or complicate subsequent ipsilateral surgery and diagnostic procedures .
Consider the possible effects of the use of STERITALC ® on future diagnostic and therapeutic procedures prior to administration .
5 . 3 Lead Content Lead is present in STERITALC ® as an impurity .
The main target organ for lead toxicity is the nervous system , but effects of lead exposure also include increased blood pressure , anemia , decreased sperm production , and damage to the kidneys in children and adults .
Minimal risk levels of lead have not been derived for humans because clear thresholds for effects have not been identified .
Children are more sensitive to lead toxicity than adults , and no safe blood level has been determined in children .
Cognitive and neurobehavioral deficits are observed in children exposed to lead .
Exposure of a pregnant woman to lead may cause miscarriage , premature birth , lower birth weights and slow or impaired mental development in the child .
Administration of STERITALC ® at the highest recommended dose of 10 grams may deliver up to 40 mcg of lead .
6 .
Adverse Reactions Common adverse reactions observed with intrapleural use of various talc products are fever and pain .
Other adverse reactions include dyspnea , arrhythmia , empyema , pneumonitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Procedure related adverse reactions such as bleeding , hemothorax , wound infections , atelectasis and pneumonia may occur .
8 .
Use in Specific Populations 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary STERITALC ® is contraindicated for use in pregnant women because it contains lead , which can cause fetal harm and potential loss of pregnancy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
There are no human data on the use of STERITALC ® in pregnant women .
In an animal reproduction study , oral administration of talc in pregnant rabbits during organogenesis revealed no evidence of teratogenicity at dose up to approximately 5 times the human dose [ see Data ] .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal developmental toxicity study in rabbits , talc was administered to rabbits by oral gavage daily during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 900 mg / kg ( approximately 5 times the human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
No significant dose - related toxicity was reported except at maternally toxic doses .
In multiple animal studies , intrapleurally administered talc was not absorbed systemically .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of talc in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infants , or the effects on milk production .
STERITALC ® contains lead , which is known to have adverse effects on health and development in neonates , infants and children [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast - fed infants from lead content in STERITALC ® , advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with STERITALC ® and for 5 months after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception STERITALC ® contains lead , which can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 5 months following the final dose of STERITALC ® .
Infertility STERITALC ® contains lead , which may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .

Description STERITALC ® ( talc ) is a sclerosing agent for intrapleural administration .
The molecular formula for talc is Mg3Si4O10 ( OH ) 2 .
The molecular weight is 379 . 3 g / mole .
The chemical name of talc is hydrated magnesium silicate .
The talc powder contains ≥ 95 % of hydrated magnesium silicate ; associated minerals include chlorites ( hydrated aluminum and magnesium silicates ) , magnesite ( magnesium carbonate ) , calcite ( calcium carbonate ) , and dolomite ( calcium and magnesium carbonate ) .
The talc elementary sheet is composed of a layer of magnesium - oxygen / hydroxyl octahedra , sandwiched between two layers of silicon - oxygen tetrahedra .
Talc is insoluble in water .
STERITALC ® is supplied as 2 grams , 3 grams , and 4 grams white or off - white to light gray , asbestos - free , sterile powder .
STERITALC contains particle size - controlled talc , graded to decrease the proportion of smaller particles .
12 .
Clinical Pharmacology 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Talc instilled into the pleural cavity is thought to result in an inflammatory reaction .
This reaction promotes adherence of the visceral and parietal pleura to prevent reaccumulation of pleural air or fluid .
13 .
Nonclinical Toxicology 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies on the carcinogenicity of talc have been performed using non - standard designs which prevent firm conclusions on its carcinogenicity .
With single intraperitoneal administration to mice at 20 mg and observation for at least 6 months , or 4 weekly doses administered intraperitoneally at 25 mg / dose to rats with observation for at least 84 weeks , tumor incidence was not increased .
In these studies the talc and its asbestos content were not characterized .
Genotoxicity was tested in cultures of rat pleural mesothelial cells ( RPMC ) for unscheduled DNA synthesis ( UDS ) and sister chromatid exchanges ( SCEs ) .
None of the talc samples ( which were asbestos - free ) induced enhancement of UDS or SCEs in treated cultures .
No information is available on impairment of fertility in animals by talc .
14 .
Clinical Studies 14 . 1 Malignant Pleural Effusion The data demonstrating safety and efficacy of talc in the treatment of malignant pleural effusions are derived from the published medical literature .
In these studies , greater than 1000 patients with malignant pleural effusions have been reported ( with varying degrees of detail and durations of response ) to have had successful pleurodesis with talc , administered either by poudrage or as a slurry via chest tube .
There are published efficacy data for more than 200 patients treated with STERITALC ® for malignant pleural effusion , with a success rate of approximately 89 % ( range 73 - 91 % ) .
14 . 2 Pneumothorax The data demonstrating safety and efficacy of talc in the treatment of pneumothorax are derived from the published medical literature .
There are published efficacy data for more than 500 patients treated with STERITALC ® for pneumothorax , some in conjunction with surgical procedures , with successful pleurodesis rates of 97 - 100 % .
