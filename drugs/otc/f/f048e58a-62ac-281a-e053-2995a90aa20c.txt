11 DESCRIPTION CYTALUX contains pafolacianine , an optical imaging agent , as a tetrasodium salt referred to as pafolacianine sodium .
Chemically , pafolacianine sodium is ( S ) - 2 - ( 4 - ( ( ( 2 - amino - 4 - oxo - 3 , 4 - dihydropteridin - 6 - yl ) methyl ) amino ) benzamido ) - 3 - ( 4 - ( ( ( E ) - 2 - ( ( E ) - 2 - ( 3 , 3 - dimethyl - 5 - sulfonato - 1 - ( 4 - sulfonatobutyl ) - 3 H - indol - 1 - ium - 2 - yl ) vinyl ) - 6 - ( ( E ) - 2 - ( 3 , 3 - dimethyl - 5 - sulfonato - 1 - ( 4 - sulfonatobutyl ) indolin - 2 - ylidene ) ethylidene ) cyclohex - 1 - en - 1 - yl ) oxy ) phenyl ) propanoate hydrate tetrasodium .
Pafolacianine sodium has a molecular formula of C 61 H 63 N 9 Na 4 O 17 S 4 , a molecular mass of 1414 . 42 g / mol and has the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] CYTALUX ( pafolacianine ) injection is a sterile , non - pyrogenic , dark bluish green , clear aqueous solution for intravenous use .
Each vial contains 3 . 2 mg ( 2 mg / mL ) pafolacianine ( equivalent to 3 . 4 mg pafolacianine sodium ) , 14 . 4 mg sodium chloride , 0 . 23 mg potassium phosphate monobasic , 1 . 27 mg sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate in 1 . 6 mL volume .
The pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide and / or hydrochloric acid and is between 7 . 1 to 7 . 8 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Pafolacianine binds to folate receptor ( FR ) - expressing cells with ~ 1 nM affinity , internalizes via receptor - mediated endocytosis , and accumulates intracellularly .
Pafolacianine absorbs light in the near - infrared ( NIR ) region within a range of 760 nm to 785 nm with peak absorption of 776 nm and emits fluorescence within a range of 790 nm to 815 nm with a peak emission of 796 nm .
CYTALUX is a fluorescent drug that targets FR , which are overexpressed in ovarian cancer .
The mechanism of CYTALUX detection of lung lesions is not well understood .
The density of FR in malignant lesions in the lung is generally similar to that of normal lung tissue .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Tumor to background ratios of fluorescence intensity changed with different mass doses studied in patients with ovarian cancer .
High tumor to background ratio was observed with 0 . 025 mg / kg dose .
CYTALUX exposure - response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are unknown .

Distribution The mean volume of distribution ( V z ) is 17 . 1 ± 5 . 99 L , indicating distribution into tissues .
Plasma protein binding of pafolacianine is 93 . 7 % .
No notable partitioning into red blood cells has been observed .
Elimination The elimination half - life of pafolacianine is 0 . 44 ± 0 . 23 hours and mean plasma clearance is 28 . 6 ± 4 . 97 L / hr .
Metabolism Pafolacianine sodium is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes .
Excretion Following a single IV infusion of radiolabeled pafolacianine sodium , approximately 35 % of the dose was recovered in urine ( 19 . 1 % ) and in feces ( 15 . 8 % ) after approximately 3 - 5 weeks .
