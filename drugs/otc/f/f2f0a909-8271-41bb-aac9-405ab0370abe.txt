The clinical result is a reduction of the skeletal muscle spasm with relief of pain and increased mobility of the involved muscles .
Blood levels of chlorzoxazone can be detected in people during the first 30 minutes and peak levels may be reached , in the majority of the subjects , in about 1 to 2 hours after oral administration of chlorzoxazone .
Chlorzoxazone is rapidly metabolized and is excreted in the urine , primarily in a conjugated form as the glucuronide .
