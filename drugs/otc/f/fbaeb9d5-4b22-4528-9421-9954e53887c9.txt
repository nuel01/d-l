1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE THALITONE is a thiazide - like diuretic indicated : • For the treatment of hypertension , to lower blood pressure .
Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events , primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions ( 1 . 1 ) .
• as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with heart failure , cirrhosis of the liver , and renal disease , including nephrotic syndrome ( 1 . 2 ) .
1 . 1 Hypertension THALITONE ® is indicated for the treatment of hypertension , to lower blood pressure .
Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events , primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions .
These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs .
There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with THALITONE .
Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management , including , as appropriate , lipid control , diabetes management , antithrombotic therapy , smoking cessation , exercise , and limited sodium intake .
Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals .
For specific advice on goals and management , see published guidelines , such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program ’ s Joint National Committee on Prevention , Detection , Evaluation , and Treatment of High Blood Pressure ( JNC ) .
Numerous antihypertensive drugs , from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action , have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality , and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction , and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs , that is largely responsible for those benefits .
The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke , but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly .
Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk , and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures , so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit .
Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk , so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension ( for example , patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia ) , and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal .
THALITONE can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents .
1 . 2 Edema Chlorthalidone is indicated in adults as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with heart failure , cirrhosis of the liver , and renal disease , including nephrotic syndrome .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Initiate therapy with the lowest possible dose , then titrate according to individual patient response ( 2 . 1 ) .
• Hypertension : Recommended initial dose is 15 mg daily with food .
If additional blood pressure reduction is needed , increase the dose to 25 mg ( 2 . 2 ) .
• Edema : Recommended initial dose is 50 mg to 100 mg daily or 100 mg on alternate days .
Depending on response , dosage can be decreased or increased up to a maximum of 200 mg daily ( 2 . 3 ) .
2 . 1 General Considerations THALITONE cannot be substituted with other formulations of chlorthalidone .
Initiate therapy with the lowest possible dose , then titrate according to individual patient response .
2 . 2 Hypertension The initial recommended dose is 15 mg once daily with food .
After 2 weeks , the dosage may be increased to a single daily dose of 25 mg if additional blood pressure reduction is needed .
Doses above 25 mg are not expected to result in increased blood pressure reduction .
2 . 3 Edema The recommended initial dosage is 50 to 100 mg daily or 100 mg on alternate days .
Depending on response , dosage can be decreased or increased up to a maximum of 200 mg daily .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS THALITONE 15 mg tablets are white biconvex , kidney shaped tablets with “ L ” on lower punch and “ 96 ” on the upper punch .
THALITONE 25 mg tablets are white biconvex , kidney shaped tablets with “ L ” on one side and “ 99 ” on the other side .
Tablets : 15 mg and 25 mg ( 3 ) .
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS THALITONE is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to chlorthalidone or other sulfonamide - derived drugs .
• Anuria ( 4 ) .
• Hypersensitivity ( 4 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypotension : Higher risk for patients with impaired sympathetic response , volume - depletion or salt restriction ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Renal Impairment : Patients with pre - existing kidney disease may be at higher risk .
( 5 . 2 ) .
• Monitor serum electrolytes periodically ( 5 . 3 ) .
5 . 1 Hypotension THALITONE may cause symptomatic hypotension .
Patients with impaired sympathetic response , volume - depletion or who are salt restricted may be at increased risk for developing hypotension .
If hypotension occurs , place the patient in the supine position and , if necessary , give intravenous normal saline .
A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment , which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized .
5 . 2 Impaired Renal Function Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by diuretics .
Patients with chronic kidney disease , heart failure , or volume depletion may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on THALITONE .
Monitor renal function periodically .
Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on THALITONE [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 3 Electrolyte Abnormalities THALITONE can cause hypokalemia , hyponatremia , hypochloremic alkalosis , and hypomagnesemia .
Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion .
Monitor serum electrolytes periodically .
If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs ( e . g . , muscular weakness , paresis , or ECG alterations ) , THALITONE should be discontinued .
Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides .
5 . 4 Metabolic Disturbances Chlorthalidone may alter glucose tolerance .
Chlorthalidone may raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides .
Chlorthalidone may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients .
Chlorthalidone decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium .
Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving THALITONE .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Effect of chlorthalidone on other drugs Chlorthalidone may add to or potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs .
Chlorthalidone and related drugs may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine .
Lithium renal clearance is reduced by chlorthalidone , increasing the risk of lithium toxicity .
Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use .
• Antihypertensive drugs : Chlorthalidone may add to or potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs ( 7 ) .
• Lithium : Lithium renal clearance is reduced by chlorthalidone , increasing the risk of lithium toxicity ( 7 ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm ( 8 . 1 ) .
• Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8 . 2 ) .
• Pediatrics : Safety and efficacy in children have not been established ( 8 . 4 ) .
• Geriatric Use : No overall difference in responses versus younger patients but care should be taken in dose selection in patients with impaired renal function ( 8 . 5 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data over decades from observational studies and reports with chlorthalidone use in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage .
However , adverse fetal outcomes , including fetal or neonatal jaundice , thrombocytopenia , hypoglycemia , and electrolyte abnormalities have been reported following maternal use of thiazide diuretics ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Chlorthalidone should not be used as first - line therapy to treat hypertension in pregnancy .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre - eclampsia , gestational diabetes , premature delivery , and delivery complications ( e . g . , need for cesarean section , and post - partum hemorrhage ) .
Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and stillbirth .
Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions Thiazides can cross the placenta , and concentrations reached in the umbilical vein approach those in the maternal plasma .
Thiazides , like other diuretics , can cause placental hypoperfusion .
Use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice , thrombocytopenia , hypoglycemia , and electrolyte abnormalities .
Thiazides do not prevent or alter the course of EPH ( Edema , Proteinuria , Hypertension ) gestosis ( pre - eclampsia ) and should not be used as first - line therapy to treat hypertension in pregnant women .
Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in the rat and the rabbit and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to chlorthalidone . The available data do not allow the calculation of comparisons between the exposure of chlorthalidone observed in animal studies to the systemic exposure that would be expected in humans .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Chlorthalidone is present in human milk .
There is no information regarding the effects of chlorthalidone on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for chlorthalidone accumulation which may lead to serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant ( such as jaundice , thrombocytopenia , hyperglycemia , electrolyte abnormalities ) , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with chlorthalidone .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of THALITONE did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
10 OVERDOSAGE Symptoms of acute overdosage include nausea , weakness , dizziness and disturbances of electrolyte balance .
The oral LD50 of the drug in the mouse and the rat is more than 25 , 000 mg / kg body weight .
The minimum lethal dose ( MLD ) in humans has not been established .
There is no specific antidote but gastric lavage is recommended , followed by supportive treatment .
Where necessary , this may include intravenous dextrose - saline with potassium , administered with caution .
11 DESCRIPTION THALITONE ( chlorthalidone USP ) is an antihypertensive / diuretic supplied as 15 mg and 25 mg tablets for oral use .
It is a monosulfamyl diuretic that differs chemically from thiazide diuretics in that a double ring system is incorporated in its structure .
It is a racemic mixture of 2 - chloro - 5 - ( 1 - hydroxy - 3 - oxo - 1 - isoindolinyl ) benzenesulfonamide , with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Chlorthalidone is practically insoluble in water , in ether and in chloroform ; soluble in methanol ; slightly soluble in alcohol .
The inactive ingredients are colloidal silicon dioxide , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , povidone , sodium starch glycolate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Chlorthalidone is a long - acting oral diuretic with antihypertensive activity .
The diuretic effects of chlorthalidone and the benzothiadiazine ( thiazide ) diuretics appear to arise from similar mechanisms and the maximal effect of chlorthalidone and the thiazides appear to be similar .
The site of the action appears to be the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron .
Although the mechanism of action of chlorthalidone and related drugs is not wholly clear , sodium and water depletion appear to provide a basis for its antihypertensive effect .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The diuretic action of chlorthalidone commences a mean of 2 . 6 hours after dosing and continues for up to 72 hours .
The drug produces diuresis with increased excretion of sodium and chloride .
The diuretic effects of chlorthalidone lead to decreased extracellular fluid volume , plasma volume , cardiac output , total exchangeable sodium , glomerular filtration rate , and renal plasma flow .
Chlorthalidone produces dose - related reductions in serum potassium levels , elevations in serum uric acid and blood glucose , and it can lead to decreased sodium and chloride levels .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption THALITONE ( chlorthalidone USP ) has been formulated with PVP ( povidone polyvinylpyrrolidone ) , a bioavailability enhancer that provides 104 % to 116 % bioavailability relative to an oral solution of chlorthalidone [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
THALITONE cannot be substituted with other formulations of chlorthalidone .
Distribution In the blood , approximately 75 % of the drug is bound to plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0 . 2 to 7 . 7 ug / mL .
Elimination The mean plasma half - life of chlorthalidone is about 40 to 60 hours .
It is eliminated primarily as unchanged drug in the urine .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility No information is available .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two similarly designed , 12 - week , double - blind , parallel group , placebo - controlled multicenter studies were conducted to compare THALITONE 15 mg to the standard chlorthalidone 25 mg in terms of reduction in blood pressure and metabolic disturbances .
Collectively , a total of 222 patients with long - standing diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 104 mm Hg were randomized to receive THALITONE 15 mg ( N = 71 ) , standard chlorthalidone 25 mg ( N = 75 ) , or placebo ( N = 76 ) .
THALITONE 15 mg has the advantage of demonstrating potentially fewer metabolic disturbances ( Table 1 ) in particular , lowered glucose levels when compared to Hygroton ® 25 mg in clinical setting ( Table 2 ) .
THALITONE 15 mg helps meet the goal of lowering blood pressure in patients that respond to Chlorthalidone therapy .
In general , electrolyte abnormalities are a class effect associated with Chlorthalidone therapy .
