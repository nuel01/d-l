5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Granisetron hydrochloride injection does not stimulate gastric or intestinal peristalsis and should not be used instead of nasogastric suction .
( 5 . 1 ) • QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride injection .
Use with caution in patients with pre - existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypersensitivity reactions , such as anaphylaxis , shortness of breath , hypotension , and urticaria , may occur in patients with known hypersensitivity to other selective 5 - HT3 receptor antagonists .
( 5 . 3 ) • Serotonin syndrome has been reported with other granisetron products , alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Gastric or Intestinal Peristalsis Granisetron hydrochloride injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis .
It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction .
The use of granisetron hydrochloride injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and / or gastric distention .
5 . 2 Cardiovascular Events An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted , but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride injection .
Therefore , granisetron hydrochloride injection should be used with caution in patients with pre - existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders , as this might lead to clinical consequences .
Patients with cardiac disease , on cardio - toxic chemotherapy , with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and / or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk .
5 . 3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions ( eg .
anaphylaxis , shortness of breath , hypotension , urticaria ) may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5 - HT3 receptor antagonists .
5 . 4 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5 - HT3 receptor antagonists .
Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs ( e . g . , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors , mirtazapine , fentanyl , lithium , tramadol , and intravenous methylene blue ) .
Some of the reported cases were fatal .
Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5 - HT3 receptor antagoinist alone has also been reported .
The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5 - HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post - anesthesia care unit or an infusion center .
Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms : mental status changes ( e . g . , agitation , hallucinations , delirium , and coma ) , autonomic instability ( e . g . , tachycardia , labile blood pressure , dizziness , diaphoresis , flushing , hyperthermia ) , neuromuscular symptoms ( e . g . , tremor , rigidity , myoclonus , hyperreflexia , incoordination ) , seizures , with or without gastrointestinal symptoms ( e . g . , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ) .
Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome , especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs .
If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur , discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment .
Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome , especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions : • Chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting ( ≥ 3 % ) : Headache , and constipation ( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Wockhardt USA LLC .

QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride injection [ see WarningsandPrecautions ( 5 . 2 ) and DrugInteractions ( 7 ) ] .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients .
Chemotherapy - Induced Nausea and Vomiting The following have been reported during controlled clinical trials or in the routine management of patients .
The percentage figures are based on clinical trial experience only .
Table 1 gives the comparative frequencies of the two most commonly reported adverse reactions ( ≥ 3 % ) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection , in single - day chemotherapy trials .
These patients received chemotherapy , primarily cisplatin , and intravenous fluids during the 24 - hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration .
Reactions were generally recorded over seven days post - granisetron hydrochloride injection administration .
Table1PrincipalAdverseReactionsinClinicalTrials - Single - DayChemotherapy 1 Metoclopramide / dexamethasone and phenothiazines / dexamethasone .
Percent of Patients With Reaction Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 40 mcg / kg ( n = 1268 ) Comparator1 ( n = 422 ) Headache Constipation 14 % 3 % 6 % 3 % Additional adverse events reported in clinical trials were asthenia , somnolence and diarrhea .
In over 3 , 000 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection ( 2 to 160 mcg / kg ) in single - day and multiple - day clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies , adverse events , other than those adverse reactions listed in Table 1 , were observed ; attribution of many of these events to granisetron hydrochloride injection is uncertain .
Hepatic : In comparative trials , mainly with cisplatin regimens , elevations of AST and ALT ( > 2 times the upper limit of normal ) following administration of granisetron hydrochloride injection occurred in 2 . 8 % and 3 . 3 % of patients , respectively .
These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators ( AST : 2 . 1 % ; ALT : 2 . 4 % ) .
Cardiovascular : Hypertension ( 2 % ) ; hypotension , arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia , atrial fibrillation , varying degrees of A - V block , ventricular ectopy including non - sustained tachycardia , and ECG abnormalities have been observed rarely .
CentralNervousSystem : Agitation , anxiety , CNS stimulation and insomnia were seen in less than 2 % of patients .
Extrapyramidal syndrome occurred rarely and only in the presence of other drugs associated with this syndrome .
Hypersensitivity : Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions , sometimes severe ( eg , anaphylaxis , shortness of breath , hypotension , urticaria ) have been reported .
Other : Fever ( 3 % ) , taste disorder ( 2 % ) , skin rashes ( 1 % ) .
In multiple - day comparative studies , fever occurred more frequently with granisetron hydrochloride injection ( 8 . 6 % ) than with comparative drugs ( 3 . 4 % , P < 0 . 014 ) , which usually included dexamethasone .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of granisetron hydrochloride injection .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to granisetron hydrochloride injection exposure .
QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride injection [ see Warnings andPrecautions ( 5 . 2 ) andDrugInteractions ( 7 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Granisetron hydrochloride injection has been administered safely with benzodiazepines , neuroleptics , and anti - ulcer medications .
( 7 ) • Does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies .
( 7 ) • Inducers or inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes may change the clearance and therefore the half - life of granisetron .
( 7 ) • Coadministration of granisetron hydrochloride injection with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and / or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences .
( 7 ) Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P - 450 drug - metabolizing enzyme system invitro .
There have been no definitive drug - drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs ; however , in humans , granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines , neuroleptics and anti - ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments .
Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies .
Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P - 450 drug - metabolizing enzymes , inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and , hence , the half - life of granisetron .
No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients .
In addition , the activity of the cytochrome P - 450 subfamily 3A4 ( involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents ) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride injection invitro .
In invitro human microsomal studies , ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride injection .
However , the clinical significance of invivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known .
In a human pharmacokinetic study , hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25 % increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride injection .
The clinical significance of this change is not known .
QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride injection .
Use of granisetron hydrochloride injection in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and / or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences .
Serotonin syndrome ( including altered mental status , autonomic instability , and neuromuscular symptoms ) has been described following the concomitant use of 5 - HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs , including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Use only if clearly needed .
( 8 . 1 ) • Nursing mothers : Caution should be exercised when administered to a nursing woman .
( 8 . 3 ) • Geriatric use : No differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients were observed in reported clinical experience .
( 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy PregnancyCategoryB Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rats at intravenous doses up to 9 mg / kg / day ( 54 mg / m2 / day , 146 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) and pregnant rabbits at intravenous doses up to 3 mg / kg / day ( 35 . 4 mg / m2 / day , 96 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to granisetron .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether granisetron is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when granisetron hydrochloride injection is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Chemotherapy - Induced Nausea and Vomiting [ SeeDosageandAdministration ( 2 ) ] for use in chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting in pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 2 years of age have not been established .
Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) .
Granisetron has been evaluated in a pediatric patient clinical trial for use in the prevention of PONV .
Due to the lack of efficacy and the QT prolongation observed in this trial , use of granisetron for the prevention of PONV in children is not recommended .
The trial was a prospective , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group trial that evaluated 157 children aged 2 to 16 years who were undergoing elective surgery for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy .
The purpose of the trial was to assess two dose levels ( 20 mcg / kg and 40 mcg / kg ) of intravenous granisetron in the prevention of PONV .
There was no active comparator or placebo .
The primary endpoint was total control of nausea and vomiting ( defined as no nausea , vomiting / retching , or use of rescue medication ) in the 24 hours following surgery .
Efficacy was not established due to lack of a dose response .
The trial also included standard 12 lead ECGs performed pre - dose and after the induction of anesthesia .
ECGs were repeated at the end of surgery after the administration of granisetron and just prior to reversal of anesthesia .
QT prolongation was seen at both dose levels .
Five patients in this trial experienced an increase of ≥ 60 msec in QTcF .
In addition , there were two patients whose QTcF was ≥ 500 msec .
Interpretation of the QTcF prolongation was confounded by multiple factors , including the use of concomitant medication and the lack of either a placebo or active control .
A thorough QT trial in adults has not been performed .
Other adverse events that occurred in the study included : vomiting ( 5 to 8 % ) , post - procedural hemorrhage ( 3 to 5 % ) , and dehydration ( 0 to 5 % ) .
Pediatric patients under 2 years of age have not been studied .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use During chemotherapy clinical trials , 713 patients 65 years of age or older received granisetron hydrochloride injection .
The safety and effectiveness were similar in patients of various ages .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific antidote for granisetron hydrochloride injection overdosage .
In case of overdosage , symptomatic treatment should be given .
Overdosage of up to 38 . 5 mg of granisetron hydrochloride injection has been reported without symptoms or only the occurrence of a slight headache .
11 DESCRIPTION Granisetron hydrochloride injection , USP is a serotonin - 3 ( 5 - HT3 ) receptor antagonist .
Chemically it is endo - N - ( 9 - methyl - 9 - azabicyclo [ 3 . 3 . 1 ] non - 3 - yl ) - 1 - methyl - 1 H - indazole - 3 - carboxamide hydrochloride with a molecular weight of 348 . 9 ( 312 . 4 free base ) .
Its empirical formula is C18H24N4O • HCl , while its chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Granisetron hydrochloride , USP is a white crystalline powder , freely soluble in water and normal saline at 20 ° C . Granisetron hydrochloride injection , USP is a clear , colorless , sterile , nonpyrogenic , aqueous solution for intravenous administration .
Granisetron hydrochloride injection , USP 1 mg / mL is available in 1 mL single - use vial .
1 mg / mL : Each 1 mL contains 1 . 12 mg granisetron hydrochloride , USP equivalent to granisetron , 1 mg ; sodium chloride , 9 mg ; citric acid , 2 mg ; sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid ( used to adjust pH ) Contains no preservative .
The solution ' s pH ranges from 4 . 0 to 6 . 0 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Granisetron is a selective 5 - hydroxytryptamine3 ( 5 - HT3 ) receptor antagonist with little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors , including 5 - HT1 ; 5 - HT1A ; 5 - HT1B / C ; 5 - HT2 ; for alpha1 - , alpha2 - or beta - adrenoreceptors ; for dopamine - D2 ; or for histamine - H1 ; benzodiazepine ; picrotoxin or opioid receptors .
Serotonin receptors of the 5 - HT3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema .
During chemotherapy - induced vomiting , mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin , which stimulates 5 - HT3 receptors .
This evokes vagal afferent discharge and may induce vomiting .
Animal studies demonstrate that , in binding to 5 - HT3 receptors , Granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin .
In the ferret animal model , a single granisetron injection prevented vomiting due to high - dose cisplatin or arrested vomiting within 5 to 30 seconds .
In most human studies , granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure , heart rate or ECG .
No evidence of an effect on plasma prolactin or aldosterone concentrations has been found in other studies .
Granisetron hydrochloride injection exhibited no effect on oro - cecal transit time in normal volunteers given a single intravenous infusion of 50 mcg / kg or 200 mcg / kg .
Single and multiple oral doses slowed colonic transit in normal volunteers .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Chemotherapy - InducedNauseaandVomiting In adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and in volunteers , mean pharmacokinetic data obtained from an infusion of a single 40 mcg / kg dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection are shown in Table 2 .

Metabolism Granisetron metabolism involves N - demethylation and aromatic ring oxidation followed by conjugation .
Invitro liver microsomal studies show that granisetron ' s major route of metabolism is inhibited by ketoconazole , suggestive of metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P - 450 3 A subfamily .
Animal studies suggest that some of the metabolites may also have 5 - HT3 receptor antagonist activity .
Elimination Clearance is predominantly by hepatic metabolism .
In normal volunteers , approximately 12 % of the administered dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine in 48 hours .
The remainder of the dose is excreted as metabolites , 49 % in the urine , and 34 % in the feces .
Subpopulations Gender There was high inter - and intra - subject variability noted in these studies .
No difference in mean AUC was found between males and females , although males had a higher Cmax generally .
Elderly The ranges of the pharmacokinetic parameters in elderly volunteers ( mean age 71 years ) , given a single 40 mcg / kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection , were generally similar to those in younger healthy volunteers ; mean values were lower for clearance and longer for half - life in the elderly patients ( see Table 2 ) .
PediatricPatients A pharmacokinetic study in pediatric cancer patients ( 2 to 16 years of age ) , given a single 40 mcg / kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection , showed that volume of distribution and total clearance increased with age .
No relationship with age was observed for peak plasma concentration or terminal phase plasma half - life .
When volume of distribution and total clearance are adjusted for body weight , the pharmacokinetics of granisetron are similar in pediatric and adult cancer patients .
RenalFailurePatients Total clearance of granisetron was not affected in patients with severe renal failure who received a single 40 mcg / kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection .
HepaticallyImpairedPatients A pharmacokinetic study in patients with hepatic impairment due to neoplastic liver involvement showed that total clearance was approximately halved compared to patients without hepatic impairment .
Given the wide variability in pharmacokinetic parameters noted in patients , dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic functional impairment is not necessary .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 24 - month carcinogenicity study , rats were treated orally with granisetron 1 , 5 or 50 mg / kg / day ( 6 , 30 or 300 mg / m2 / day ) .
The 50 mg / kg / day dose was reduced to 25 mg / kg / day ( 150 mg / m2 / day ) during week 59 due to toxicity .
For a 50 kg person of average height ( 1 . 46 m2 body surface area ) , these doses represent 16 , 81 and 405 times the recommended clinical dose ( 0 . 37 mg / m2 , iv ) on a body surface area basis .
There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in males treated with 5 mg / kg / day ( 30 mg / m2 / day , 81 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) and above , and in females treated with 25 mg / kg / day ( 150 mg / m2 / day , 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) .
No increase in liver tumors was observed at a dose of 1 mg / kg / day ( 6 mg / m2 / day , 16 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) in males and 5 mg / kg / day ( 30 mg / m2 / day , 81 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) in females .
In a 12 - month oral toxicity study , treatment with granisetron 100 mg / kg / day ( 600 mg / m2 / day , 1622 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) produced hepatocellular adenomas in male and female rats while no such tumors were found in the control rats .
A 24 - month mouse carcinogenicity study of granisetron did not show a statistically significant increase in tumor incidence , but the study was not conclusive .
Because of the tumor findings in rat studies , granisetron hydrochloride injection should be prescribed only at the dose and for the indication recommended [ seeIndications and Usage ( 1 ) andDosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Granisetron was not mutagenic in an invitro Ames test and mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay , and invivo mouse micronucleus test and invitro and exvivo rat hepatocyte UDS assays .
It , however , produced a significant increase in UDS in HeLa cells invitro and a significant increased incidence of cells with polyploidy in an invitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test .
Granisetron at subcutaneous doses up to 6 mg / kg / day ( 36 mg / m2 / day , 97 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Chemotherapy - Induced Nausea and Vomiting Single - Day Chemotherapy Cisplatin - BasedChemotherapy In a double - blind , placebo - controlled study in 28 cancer patients , granisetron hydrochloride injection , administered as a single intravenous infusion of 40 mcg / kg , was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by cisplatin chemotherapy ( see Table 3 ) .
Table3PreventionofChemotherapy - InducedNauseaandVomiting - Single - DayCisplatinTherapy11 Cisplatin administration began within 10 minutes of granisetron hydrochloride injection infusion and continued for 1 . 5 to 3 . 0 hours .
Mean cisplatin dose was 86 mg / m2 in the granisetron hydrochloride injection group and 80 mg / m2 in the placebo group .

The 10 mcg / kg dose was at least as effective as the higher doses .
ModeratelyEmetogenicChemotherapy Granisetron hydrochloride injection , 40 mcg / kg , was compared with the combination of chlorpromazine ( 50 to 200 mg / 24 hours ) and dexamethasone ( 12 mg ) in patients treated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy , including primarily carboplatin > 300 mg / m2 , cisplatin 20 to 50 mg / m2 and cyclophosphamide > 600 mg / m2 .
Granisetron hydrochloride injection was superior to the chlorpromazine regimen in preventing nausea and vomiting ( see Table 6 ) .
Table6PreventionofChemotherapy - InducedNauseaandVomiting - Single - DayModeratelyEmetogenicChemotherapy 1 Patients also received dexamethasone , 12 mg .

Repeat - Cycle Chemotherapy In an uncontrolled trial , 512 cancer patients received granisetron hydrochloride injection , 40 mcg / kg , prophylactically , for two cycles of chemotherapy , 224 patients received it for at least four cycles , and 108 patients received it for at least six cycles .
Granisetron hydrochloride injection efficacy remained relatively constant over the first six repeat cycles , with complete response rates ( no vomiting and no moderate or severe nausea in 24 hours ) of 60 % to 69 % .
No patients were studied for more than 15 cycles .
Pediatric Studies A randomized double - blind study evaluated the 24 - hour response of 80 pediatric cancer patients ( age 2 to 16 years ) to granisetron hydrochloride injection 10 , 20 or 40 mcg / kg .
Patients were treated with cisplatin ≥ 60 mg / m2 , cytarabine ≥ 3 g / m2 , cyclophosphamide ≥ 1 g / m2 or nitrogen mustard ≥ 6 mg / m2 ( see Table 7 ) .
