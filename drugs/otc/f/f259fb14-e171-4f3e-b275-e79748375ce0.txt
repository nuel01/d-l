( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Risk of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation : Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection before initiation of HCV treatment .
Monitor HCV / HBV coinfected patients for HBV reactivation and hepatitis flare during HCV treatment and post - treatment follow - up .
Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated .
( 5 . 1 ) • Bradycardia with amiodarone coadministration : Serious symptomatic bradycardia may occur in patients taking amiodarone , particularly in patients also receiving beta blockers , or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and / or advanced liver disease .
Coadministration of amiodarone with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is not recommended .
In patients without alternative viable treatment options , cardiac monitoring is recommended .
( 5 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation in Patients Coinfected with HCV and HBV Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) reactivation has been reported in HCV / HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals , and who were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy .
Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis , hepatic failure , and death .
Cases have been reported in patients who are HBsAg positive and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection ( i . e . , HBsAg negative and anti - HBc positive ) .
HBV reactivation has also been reported in patients receiving certain immunosuppressants or chemotherapeutic agents ; the risk of HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV direct - acting antivirals may be increased in these patients .
HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level .
In patients with resolved HBV infection , reappearance of HBsAg can occur .
Reactivation of HBV replication may be accompanied by hepatitis , i . e . , increases in aminotransferase levels and , in severe cases , increases in bilirubin levels , liver failure , and death can occur .
Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti - HBc before initiating HCV treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir .
In patients with serologic evidence of HBV infection , monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir and during post - treatment follow - up .
Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated .
5 . 2 Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with a sofosbuvir - containing regimen .
A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir - containing regimen ( HARVONI ® [ ledipasvir / sofosbuvir ] ) .
Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days , but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment .
Patients also taking beta blockers , or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and / or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone .
Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment .
The mechanism for this effect is unknown .
Coadministration of amiodarone with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is not recommended .
For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative viable treatment options and who will be coadministered sofosbuvir and velpatasvir : • Counsel patients about the risk of symptomatic bradycardia .
• Cardiac monitoring in an in - patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended , after which outpatient or self - monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment .
Patients who are taking sofosbuvir and velpatasvir who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above .
Due to amiodarone ' s long half - life , patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting sofosbuvir and velpatasvir should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above .
Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately .
Symptoms may include near - fainting or fainting , dizziness or lightheadedness , malaise , weakness , excessive tiredness , shortness of breath , chest pains , confusion , or memory problems [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Concomitant Use of Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir with Inducers of P - gp and / or Moderate to Strong Inducers of CYP Drugs that are inducers of P - gp and / or moderate to strong inducers of CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , or CYP3A4 ( e . g . , rifampin , St . John ' s wort , carbamazepine ) may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir and / or velpatasvir , leading to potentially reduced therapeutic effect of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir .
The use of these agents with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is not recommended [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 4 Risks Associated with Ribavirin and Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir Combination Treatment If sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is administered with ribavirin , the warnings and precautions for ribavirin apply to this combination regimen .

( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 , 7 ) • Clearance of HCV infection with direct acting antivirals may lead to changes in hepatic function , which may impact safe and effective use of concomitant medications .
Frequent monitoring of relevant laboratory parameters ( INR or blood glucose ) and dose adjustments of certain concomitant medications may be necessary .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir are substrates of drug transporters P - gp and BCRP while GS - 331007 ( the predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir ) is not .
In vitro , slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir by CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , and CYP3A4 was observed .
Drugs that are inducers of P - gp and / or moderate to strong inducers of CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , or CYP3A4 ( e . g . , rifampin , St . John ' s wort , carbamazepine ) may decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir and / or velpatasvir , leading to reduced therapeutic effect of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir .
The use of these agents with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir may be coadministered with P - gp , BCRP , and CYP inhibitors .
7 . 2 Potential for Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir to Affect Other Drugs Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporters P - gp , breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , and OATP2B1 .
Coadministration of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with drugs that are substrates of these transporters may increase the exposure of such drugs .
7 . 3 Established and Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Clearance of HCV infection with direct acting antivirals may lead to changes in hepatic function , which may impact the safe and effective use of concomitant medications .
For example , altered blood glucose control resulting in serious symptomatic hypoglycemia has been reported in diabetic patients in postmarketing case reports and published epidemiological studies .
Management of hypoglycemia in these cases required either discontinuation or dose modification of concomitant medications used for diabetes treatment .
Frequent monitoring of relevant laboratory parameters ( e . g . , International Normalized Ratio [ INR ] in patients taking warfarin , blood glucose levels in diabetic patients ) or drug concentrations of concomitant medications such as cytochrome P450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index ( e . g . , certain immunosuppressants ) is recommended to ensure safe and effective use .
Dose adjustments of concomitant medications may be necessary .
Table 4 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions .
The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets ( 400 mg / 100 mg ) , or sofosbuvir and velpatasvir as individual agents , or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4 % and 15 – 20 % , respectively .
Data Sofosbuvir : Sofosbuvir was administered orally to pregnant rats ( up to 500 mg / kg / day ) and rabbits ( up to 300 mg / kg / day ) on gestation days 6 to 18 and 6 to 19 , respectively , and also to rats ( oral doses up to 500 mg / kg / day ) on gestation day 6 to lactation / post - partum day 20 .
No significant effects on embryo - fetal ( rats and rabbits ) or pre / postnatal ( rats ) development were observed at the highest doses tested .
The systemic exposures ( AUC ) of the predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir ( GS - 331007 ) during gestation were approximately 4 ( rats ) and 10 ( rabbits ) times the exposure in humans at the RHD .
Velpatasvir : Velpatasvir was administered orally to pregnant mice ( up to 1000 mg / kg / day ) , rats ( up to 200 mg / kg / day ) , and rabbits ( up to 300 mg / kg / day ) on gestation days 6 to 15 , 6 to 17 , and 7 to 20 , respectively , and also to rats ( oral doses up to 200 mg / kg ) on gestation day 6 to lactation / post - partum day 20 .
No significant effects on embryo - fetal ( mice , rats , and rabbits ) or pre / postnatal ( rats ) development were observed at the highest doses tested .
The systemic exposures ( AUC ) of velpatasvir during gestation were approximately 31 ( mice ) , 6 ( rats ) , and 0 . 4 ( rabbits ) times the exposure in humans at the RHD .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether sofosbuvir , velpatasvir , and their metabolites are present in human breast milk , affect human milk production , or have effects on the breastfed infant .
The predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir ( GS - 331007 ) was the primary component observed in the milk of lactating rats administered sofosbuvir , without effect on nursing pups .
When administered to lactating rats , velpatasvir was detected in the milk of lactating rats and in the plasma of nursing pups without effects on the nursing pups [ see Data ] .
The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for sofosbuvir and velpatasvir and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from sofosbuvir and velpatasvir or from the underlying maternal condition .
If sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is administered with ribavirin , the nursing mother ' s information for ribavirin also applies to this combination regimen .
Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for more information on use during lactation .
Data Sofosbuvir : No effects of sofosbuvir on growth and postnatal development were observed in nursing pups at the highest dose tested in rats .
Maternal systemic exposure ( AUC ) to the predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir ( GS - 331007 ) was approximately 5 times the exposure in humans at the RHD , with exposure of approximately 2 % that of maternal exposure observed in nursing pups on lactation day 10 .
In a lactation study , sofosbuvir metabolites ( primarily GS - 331007 ) were excreted into the milk of lactating rats following administration of a single oral dose of sofosbuvir ( 20 mg / kg ) on lactation day 2 , with milk concentrations of approximately 10 % that of maternal plasma concentrations observed 1 - hour post - dose .
Velpatasvir : No effects of velpatasvir on growth and postnatal development were observed in nursing pups at the highest dose tested in rats .
Maternal systemic exposure ( AUC ) to velpatasvir was approximately 5 times the exposure in humans at the RHD .
Velpatasvir was present in the milk ( approximately 173 % that of maternal plasma concentrations ) of lactating rats following a single oral dose of velpatasvir ( 30 mg / kg ) , and systemic exposure ( AUC ) in nursing pups was approximately 4 % that of maternal exposure on lactation day 10 .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential If sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is administered with ribavirin , the information for ribavirin with regard to pregnancy testing , contraception , and infertility also applies to this combination regimen .
Refer to ribavirin prescribing information for additional information .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics , safety , and effectiveness of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for treatment of HCV genotype 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 6 infection in treatment - naïve and treatment - experienced pediatric patients 3 years of age and older without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis have been established in an open - label , multicenter clinical trial ( Study 1143 , N = 216 ; 190 treatment - naïve , 26 treatment - experienced ) .
No clinically meaningful differences in pharmacokinetics were observed in comparison to those observed in adults .
The safety and effectiveness in pediatric subjects were comparable to those observed in adults .
However , among the 41 pediatric subjects less than 6 years of age , vomiting and product use issue ( spitting up the drug ) were reported more frequently ( 15 % and 10 % , respectively ; all Grade 1 or 2 ) compared to subjects 6 years of age and older .
Five subjects ( 12 % ) discontinued treatment after vomiting or spitting up the drug [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 , 2 . 5 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 8 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for treatment of HCV genotype 5 in pediatric patients 3 years of age and older without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis are supported by sofosbuvir , GS - 331007 , and velpatasvir exposures in adults and pediatric patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 and 2 . 4 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 8 ) ] .
Similar rationale is used to support dosing recommendations for pediatric patients with HCV genotype 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6 infection who have decompensated cirrhosis ( Child - Pugh B or C ) .
In patients with severe renal impairment , including those requiring dialysis , exposures of GS - 331007 , the inactive metabolite of sofosbuvir , are increased [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No data are available regarding the safety of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir in pediatric patients with renal impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir have not been established in pediatric patients less than 3 years of age .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir included 156 subjects aged 65 and over ( 12 % of total number of subjects in the Phase 3 clinical trials ) .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
No dosage adjustment of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is warranted in geriatric patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is recommended for patients with mild , moderate , or severe renal impairment , including ESRD requiring dialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] .
No safety data are available in subjects with both decompensated cirrhosis and severe renal impairment , including ESRD requiring dialysis .
Additionally , no safety data are available in pediatric patients with renal impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Refer to ribavirin tablet prescribing information regarding use of ribavirin in patients with renal impairment .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is recommended for patients with mild , moderate , or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A , B , or C ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Clinical and hepatic laboratory monitoring ( including direct bilirubin ) , as clinically indicated , is recommended for patients with decompensated cirrhosis receiving treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir and ribavirin [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 8 People Who Inject Drugs ( PWID ) , Including Those on Medication - Assisted Treatment ( MAT ) for Opioid Use Disorder Based on data from the Phase 2 trial SIMPLIFY , the safety and effectiveness of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir in subjects who self - reported injection drug use , including in those on concomitant MAT , were similar to the known safety and effectiveness profile of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir .
No dosage adjustment of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is recommended for PWID , including those on MAT for opioid use disorder [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 7 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE No specific antidote is available for overdose with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir .
If overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity .
Treatment of overdose with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient .
Hemodialysis can efficiently remove the predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir , GS - 331007 , with an extraction ratio of 53 % .
Hemodialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of velpatasvir since velpatasvir is highly bound to plasma protein .

Geriatric Patients : Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV - infected subjects showed that within the age range ( 18 to 82 years ) analyzed , age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir , GS - 331007 , or velpatasvir [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Patients with Renal Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied in HCV negative subjects with mild ( eGFR between 50 to less than 80 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , moderate ( eGFR between 30 to less than 50 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , severe renal impairment ( eGFR less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , and subjects with ESRD requiring hemodialysis following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir .
Relative to subjects with normal renal function ( eGFR greater than 80 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , the sofosbuvir AUC0 – inf was 61 % , 107 % , and 171 % higher in subjects with mild , moderate , and severe renal impairment , while the GS - 331007 AUC0 – inf was 55 % , 88 % , and 451 % higher , respectively .
In subjects with ESRD , relative to subjects with normal renal function , sofosbuvir and GS - 331007 AUC0 – inf was 28 % and 1280 % higher when sofosbuvir was dosed 1 hour before hemodialysis compared with 60 % and 2070 % higher when sofosbuvir was dosed 1 hour after hemodialysis , respectively .
A 4 - hour hemodialysis session removed approximately 18 % of administered dose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir were studied with a single dose of 100 mg velpatasvir in HCV negative subjects with severe renal impairment ( eGFR less than 30 mL / min by Cockcroft - Gault ) .
No clinically relevant differences in velpatasvir pharmacokinetics were observed between healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir , GS - 331007 , and velpatasvir were studied in HCV - infected subjects with ESRD requiring dialysis treated with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets ( 400 mg / 100 mg ) for 12 weeks .
The results were generally consistent with those in HCV negative subjects with ESRD requiring dialysis .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied following 7 - day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in HCV - infected subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B and C , respectively ) .
Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function , the sofosbuvir AUC0 – 24 were 126 % and 143 % higher in moderate and severe hepatic impairment , while the GS - 331007 AUC0 – 24 were 18 % and 9 % higher , respectively .
Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV - infected subjects indicated that cirrhosis ( including decompensated cirrhosis ) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of sofosbuvir and GS - 331007 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir were studied with a single dose of 100 mg velpatasvir in HCV negative subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B and C ) .
Velpatasvir plasma exposure ( AUCinf ) was similar in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment , severe hepatic impairment , and control subjects with normal hepatic function .
Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV - infected subjects indicated that cirrhosis ( including decompensated cirrhosis ) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of velpatasvir [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Race : Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV - infected subjects indicated that race had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of sofosbuvir , GS - 331007 , or velpatasvir .
Gender : Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV - infected subjects indicated that gender had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of sofosbuvir , GS - 331007 , or velpatasvir .
Drug Interaction Studies After oral administration of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir , sofosbuvir is rapidly absorbed and subject to extensive first - pass hepatic extraction ( hydrolysis followed by sequential phosphorylation ) to form the pharmacologically active triphosphate .
In clinical pharmacology studies , both sofosbuvir and the primary circulating metabolite GS - 331007 ( dephosphorylated nucleotide metabolite ) were monitored for purposes of pharmacokinetic analyses .
Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir are substrates of drug transporters P - gp and BCRP while GS - 331007 is not .
Velpatasvir is also transported by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 .
In vitro , slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir by CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , and CYP3A4 was observed .
Inducers of P - gp and / or moderate to strong inducers of CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , or CYP3A4 ( e . g . , rifampin , St . John ' s wort , carbamazepine ) may decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir and / or velpatasvir , leading to reduced therapeutic effect of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Coadministration with drugs that inhibit P - gp and / or BCRP may increase sofosbuvir and / or velpatasvir plasma concentrations without increasing GS - 331007 plasma concentration .
Drugs that inhibit CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , or CYP3A4 may increase plasma concentration of velpatasvir .
Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporter P - gp , BCRP , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , and OATP2B1 , and its involvement in drug interactions with these transporters is primarily limited to the process of absorption .
At clinically relevant concentration , velpatasvir is not an inhibitor of hepatic transporters OATP1A2 or OCT1 , renal transporters OCT2 , OAT1 , OAT3 , or MATE1 , or CYP or UGT1A1 enzymes .
Sofosbuvir and GS - 331007 are not inhibitors of drug transporters P - gp , BCRP , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , and OCT1 and GS - 331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1 , OAT3 , OCT2 , and MATE1 .
Sofosbuvir and GS - 331007 are not inhibitors or inducers of CYP or UGT1A1 enzymes .
The effects of coadministered drugs on the exposure of sofosbuvir , GS - 331007 , and velpatasvir are shown in Table 8 .
The effects of sofosbuvir , velpatasvir , or sofosbuvir and velpatasvir on the exposure of coadministered drugs are shown in Table 9 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .

No effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the following coadministered drugs was observed or is expected with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir ( buprenorphine / naloxone , dolutegravir , lopinavir / ritonavir , or methadone ) or its components sofosbuvir ( cyclosporine ) or velpatasvir ( cyclosporine ) .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Sofosbuvir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA - dependent RNA polymerase , which is required for viral replication .
Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analog triphosphate ( GS - 461203 ) , which can be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator .
In a biochemical assay , GS - 461203 inhibited the polymerase activity of the recombinant NS5B from HCV genotype 1 b , 2 a , 3 a , and 4 a with an IC50 value ranging from 0 . 36 to 3 . 3 micromolar .
GS - 461203 is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and RNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase .
Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein , which is required for viral replication .
Resistance selection in cell culture and cross - resistance studies indicate velpatasvir targets NS5A as its mode of action .
Antiviral Activity The EC50 values of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir against full - length or chimeric replicons encoding NS5B and NS5A sequences from the laboratory strains are presented in Table 10 .
The EC50 values of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir against clinical isolates are presented in Table 11 .

Resistance In Cell Culture HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell culture for multiple genotypes including 1 b , 2 a , 2 b , 3 a , 4 a , 5 a , and 6 a .
Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated with the NS5B substitution S282T in all replicon genotypes examined .
An M289L substitution developed along with the S282T substitution in genotype 2 a , 5 , and 6 replicons .
Site - directed mutagenesis of the S282T substitution in replicons of genotypes 1 to 6 conferred 2 - to 18 - fold reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir .
HCV genotype 1 a , 1 b , 2 a , 3 a , 4 a , 5 a , and 6 a replicon variants with reduced susceptibility to velpatasvir were selected in cell culture .
Variants developed amino acid substitutions at NS5A resistance - associated positions 24 , 28 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 58 , 92 , and 93 .
Phenotypic analysis of site - directed mutant replicons of the selected NS5A substitutions showed that single and double combinations of L31V and Y93H / N in genotype 1 a , the combination of L31V + Y93H in genotype 1 b , Y93H / S in genotype 3 a , and L31V and P32A / L / Q / R in genotype 6 conferred greater than 100 - fold reduction in velpatasvir susceptibility .
In the genotype 2 a replicon , the single mutants F28S and Y93H showed 91 - fold and 46 - fold reduced susceptibility to velpatasvir , respectively .
The single mutant Y93H conferred 3 - fold reduced susceptibility to velpatasvir in genotype 4 a replicons .
Combinations of these NS5A substitutions often showed greater reductions in susceptibility to velpatasvir than single substitutions alone .
In Clinical Trials Studies in Subjects without Cirrhosis and Subjects with Compensated Cirrhosis In a pooled analysis of subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis who received sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets ( 400 mg / 100 mg ) for 12 weeks in Phase 3 trials ( ASTRAL - 1 , ASTRAL - 2 , and ASTRAL - 3 ) , 12 subjects ( 2 with genotype 1 [ 1 a , 1 c / h ] and 10 with genotype 3 a ) qualified for resistance analysis due to virologic failure .
No subjects with genotype 2 , 4 , 5 , or 6 HCV infection experienced virologic failure .
Of the 2 genotype 1 virologic failure subjects , 1 subject had virus with emergent NS5A resistance substitution Y93N and the other had virus with emergent NS5A resistance substitutions Y93H and low - level K24M / T and L31I / V at virologic failure .
The latter subject had genotype 1 c / h virus at baseline harboring NS5A resistance polymorphisms ( Q30R , L31M , H58P ) relative to genotype 1 a .
No sofosbuvir NS5B nucleoside analog resistance - associated substitutions were observed at failure in the 2 subjects .
Of the 10 genotype 3 a virologic failure subjects , NS5A resistance substitution Y93H was observed in all 10 subjects at failure ( 7 subjects had Y93H emerge post - treatment and 3 subjects had Y93H at baseline and post - treatment ) .
Treatment - emergent sofosbuvir NS5B substitutions L314F ( n = 2 ) and L314I ( n = 1 ) were observed at high frequency ( greater than or equal to 15 % ) in the NS5B polymerase in 3 genotype 3 a subjects who relapsed : one in the sofosbuvir and velpatasvir group and two in the sofosbuvir plus ribavirin 24 - week group .
In addition , low frequency ( less than 4 % ) treatment - emergent L314P was detected in 2 genotype 3 a subjects who relapsed , including one subject in the sofosbuvir plus ribavirin 24 - week group in ASTRAL - 3 and one in the sofosbuvir and velpatasvir group in ASTRAL - 4 .
The clinical significance of this substitution is unknown .
In Trial 2104 ( liver transplant recipients ) , there were 2 virologic failures ( 1 subject with genotype 1 a and 1 subject with genotype 3 b ) .
The genotype 1 a virologic failure subject had virus with an NS5A K24R polymorphism at baseline and relapse , and treatment - emergent NS5A L31V .
The genotype 3 b virologic failure subject had virus at baseline and relapse with NS5A polymorphisms A30K + L31M , which are predominant in this subtype ; treatment - emergent NS5B S282T was detected at relapse .
Studies in Subjects with Decompensated Cirrhosis In the ASTRAL - 4 trial in subjects with decompensated cirrhosis who received sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets ( 400 mg / 100 mg ) with ribavirin for 12 weeks , 3 subjects ( 1 with genotype 1 a and 2 with genotype 3 a ) qualified for resistance analysis due to virologic failure .
No subjects with genotype 2 or 4 HCV infection who received sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks experienced virologic failure .
The genotype 1 virologic failure subject had no NS5A or NS5B resistance substitutions at failure .
The 2 genotype 3 a virologic failure subjects had the NS5A resistance substitutions Y93H and either low - level M28V or S38P emerge at failure .
One of these subjects also developed low levels ( less than 5 % ) of NS5B nucleoside analog inhibitor resistance substitutions N142T and E237G at failure .
In the ASTRAL - 4 trial , 2 subjects treated with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets ( 400 mg / 100 mg ) for 12 or 24 weeks without ribavirin had emergent sofosbuvir NS5B resistance - associated substitutions S282T at low levels ( less than 5 % ) along with L159F .
Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12 or 24 weeks without ribavirin is not recommended in patients with decompensated cirrhosis .
Persistence of Resistance - Associated Substitutions No data are available on the persistence of sofosbuvir or velpatasvir resistance - associated substitutions .
NS5A resistance - associated substitutions observed with administration of other NS5A inhibitors have been found to persist for longer than 1 year in most patients .
The long - term clinical impact of the emergence or persistence of virus containing sofosbuvir or velpatasvir resistance - associated substitutions is unknown .
Effect of Baseline HCV Polymorphisms on Treatment Response Adults Analyses were conducted to explore the association between relapse rates and pre - existing baseline NS5A resistance - associated polymorphisms ( RAPs ) ( any change from reference at NS5A amino acid positions 24 , 28 , 30 , 31 , 58 , 92 , or 93 ) identified by population or deep sequencing analysis at a sensitivity threshold of 15 % or higher for subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis in ASTRAL - 1 , ASTRAL - 2 , and ASTRAL - 3 and subjects with decompensated cirrhosis in ASTRAL - 4 .
Studies in Subjects without Cirrhosis and Subjects with Compensated Cirrhosis Among the subjects who received treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets ( 400 mg / 100 mg ) for 12 weeks , 18 % ( 37 / 209 ) , 32 % ( 38 / 117 ) , 64 % ( 149 / 232 ) , 20 % ( 56 / 274 ) , 63 % ( 73 / 115 ) , 9 % ( 3 / 34 ) , and 83 % ( 35 / 42 ) of subjects with genotype 1 a , 1 b , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 HCV , respectively , had baseline virus with NS5A RAPs .
Genotype 1 : Among the 75 genotype 1 subjects who had baseline NS5A RAPs , one subject ( 1 % ) with Q30R , L31M , and H58P polymorphisms at baseline and compensated cirrhosis relapsed .
Genotype 3 : Among the 56 genotype 3 subjects in ASTRAL - 3 who had baseline NS5A RAPs , 4 subjects ( 7 % ) relapsed ( 3 with baseline Y93H and 1 with baseline A30K ) .
Overall , 20 % ( 3 / 15 ) of genotype 3 subjects with the Y93H polymorphism at baseline relapsed .
In a pooled analysis of clinical trials in subjects with HCV genotype 3 infection , the prevalence of the baseline NS5A Y93H polymorphism was 6 % ( 104 / 1842 ) .
Among HCV genotype 3 infected subjects with the Y93H polymorphism who were treated with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets ( 400 mg / 100 mg ) for 12 weeks , 7 % ( 2 / 28 ) of subjects without cirrhosis relapsed , and 40 % ( 6 / 15 ) of subjects with compensated cirrhosis experienced virologic failure ( 5 relapse , 1 on - treatment ) .
Genotypes 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 : The presence of baseline NS5A RAPs did not affect relapse rates for subjects with genotypes 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , because all achieved sustained virologic response ( SVR ) 12 .
SVR12 was achieved in all 77 subjects who had baseline NS5B nucleoside analog inhibitor resistance polymorphisms including N142T , L159F , E / N237G , C / M289L / I , L320F / I / V , V321A / I , and S282G + V321I .
The sofosbuvir NS5B nucleoside analog inhibitor resistance substitution S282T was not detected in the baseline NS5B sequence of any subject using 1 % deep sequencing cutoff in Phase 3 trials .
Studies in Subjects with Decompensated Cirrhosis In ASTRAL - 4 , the prevalence of NS5A RAPs at baseline was 24 % ( 48 / 198 ) , 60 % ( 6 / 10 ) , 11 % ( 4 / 37 ) , and 63 % ( 5 / 8 ) in GT1 , GT2 , GT3 , and GT4 HCV subjects , respectively .
No subjects with genotypes 2 , 4 and 6 relapsed .
There were no subjects with genotype 5 in this trial .
For genotype 1 subjects , the overall relapse rates were numerically lower for the 12 - week sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with ribavirin group ( 2 % ; 1 / 66 ) compared to sofosbuvir and velpatasvir 12 - week and 24 - week treatment groups .
For subjects with NS5A RAPs , relapse rates were 0 % ( 0 / 17 ) compared to 2 % ( 1 / 49 ) for subjects without NS5A RAPs in the 12 - week sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with ribavirin containing group .
For genotype 3 subjects , overall virologic failure rates were numerically lower for the 12 - week sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with ribavirin group ( 15 % ; 2 / 13 ) compared to sofosbuvir and velpatasvir 12 - week and 24 - week treatment groups .
There are insufficient data to determine the impact of HCV NS5A RAPs in genotype 3 subjects with decompensated cirrhosis .
Three subjects in the sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with ribavirin 12 - week group had baseline NS5B nucleoside analog inhibitor polymorphisms ( N142T and L159F ) using 1 % deep sequencing cutoff and all 3 subjects achieved SVR12 .
Pediatrics In Study 1143 , the presence of NS5A and NS5B RAPs did not impact treatment outcome ; all pediatric subjects 3 years of age and older with baseline NS5A RAPs ( 15 % ; 29 / 199 ) or NS5B nucleoside inhibitor RAPs ( 3 % ; 6 / 195 ) achieved SVR following 12 weeks treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir .
Cross Resistance Both sofosbuvir and velpatasvir were fully active against substitutions associated with resistance to other classes of direct - acting antivirals with different mechanisms of action , such as NS5B non - nucleoside inhibitors and NS3 protease inhibitors .
The efficacy of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir has not been established in patients who have previously failed treatment with other regimens that include an NS5A inhibitor .
