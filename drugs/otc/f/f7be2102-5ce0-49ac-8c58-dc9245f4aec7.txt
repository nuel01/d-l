Patients who have demonstrated a previous hypersensitivity to hydroxyurea or any other component of its formulation .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Embryo - Fetal toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception .
( 5 . 3 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • Cutaneous vasculitic toxicities ( incl .
leg ulcers ) : Institute treatment and discontinue SIKLOS and / or reduce dose if this occurs .
( 5 . 4 ) • Risks with concomitant use of antiretroviral drugs : Pancreatitis , hepatotoxicity , and neuropathy have occurred .
Monitor for signs and symptoms patients with HIV infection using antiretroviral drugs ; discontinue SIKLOS , and implement treatment .
( 5 . 5 ) • Concomitant use with live virus vaccine : increased risk of severe infections .
( 5 . 6 ) • Hemolytic Anemia : Monitor blood counts throughout treatment .
If hemolysis persists , discontinue SIKLOS .
( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Myelosuppression Hydroxyurea causes severe myelosuppression .
Do not initiate treatment with hydroxyurea in patients if bone marrow function is markedly depressed .
Bone marrow suppression may occur , and leukopenia is generally its first and most common manifestation .
Thrombocytopenia and anemia occur less often , and are seldom seen without a preceding leukopenia .
Some patients , treated at the recommended initial dose of 15 mg / kg / day in adults or 20 mg / kg / day in children , have experienced severe or life - threatening myelosuppression .
Due to the change in body weight requiring modification of daily dose , pediatric patients have an increased risk of myelosuppression at the time of dose adjustment .
Evaluate hematologic status prior to and every two weeks during treatment with SIKLOS .
Provide supportive care and modify dose or discontinue SIKLOS as needed .
Recovery from myelosuppression is usually observed within 15 days when therapy is interrupted .
Resume therapy after interruption at a lower dose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 Malignancies Hydroxyurea is a human carcinogen .
In patients receiving long - term hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders ( a condition for which Siklos is not approved ) , secondary leukemia has been reported .
Leukemia secondary to long - term hydroxyurea has also been reported in patients with sickle cell disease .
Leukemia has also been reported in patients with sickle cell disease and no prior history of treatment with hydroxyurea .
Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long - term hydroxyurea .
Advise protection from sun exposure and monitor for the development of secondary malignancies .
5 . 3 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals , SIKLOS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Hydroxyurea was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 0 . 8 times and 0 . 3 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with SIKLOS for at least 6 months after therapy .
Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with SIKLOS for at least 6 months after therapy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 4 Vasculitic Toxicities ( Including Leg Ulcers ) Cutaneous vasculitic toxicities , including vasculitic ulcerations and gangrene , have occurred in patients with myeloproliferative disorders during therapy with hydroxyurea .
These vasculitic toxicities were reported most often in patients with a history of , or currently receiving , interferon therapy .
Due to potentially severe clinical outcomes for the cutaneous vasculitic ulcers reported in patients with myeloproliferative disease ( a condition for which SIKLOS is not approved ) , treatment with SIKLOS should be discontinued and / or its dose reduced if cutaneous vasculitic ulcerations develop .
Rarely , ulcers are caused by leukocytoclastic vasculitis .
Avoid use of SIKLOS in patients with wounds on the legs ( leg ulcers ) .
5 . 5 Risks with Concomitant Use of Antiretroviral Drugs Pancreatitis , hepatotoxicity , and peripheral neuropathy have occurred when hydroxyurea was administered concomitantly with antiretroviral drugs , including didanosine and stavudine [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 6 Risks with Concomitant Use of Live Virus Vaccine Avoid use of live virus vaccine in patients taking SIKLOS .
Concomitant use of hydroxyurea with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the vaccine virus and / or may increase the adverse reactions of the vaccine virus and result in severe infections [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Patient ' s antibody response to vaccines may be decreased .
Consider consultation with a specialist .
5 . 7 Macrocytosis SIKLOS may cause macrocytosis , which is self - limiting , and is often seen early in the course of treatment .
The morphologic change resembles pernicious anemia , but is not related to vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency .
This may mask the diagnosis of pernicious anemia .
Prophylactic administration of folic acid is recommended .
5 . 8 Test Interference Interference with Uric Acid , Urea , or Lactic Acid Assays is possible , rendering falsely elevated results of these in patients treated with hydroxyurea [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 9 Hemolytic Anemia Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening of anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis ( e . g . , measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase , haptoglobin , reticulocyte , unconjugated bilirubin levels , urinalysis , and direct and indirect antiglobulin [ Coombs ] tests ) .
In the setting of confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia not related to the disease and in the absence of other causes , discontinue SIKLOS .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Myelosuppression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Malignancies [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Vasculitic toxicities ( including Leg Ulcers ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Risks with concomitant use of antiretroviral drugs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Risk with concomitant use of live virus vaccine [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Macrocytosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • Hemolytic Anemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] Most common adverse reactions to SIKLOS ( incidence > 10 % ) include infections and neutropenia in children and infections and headache and dry skin in adults .

6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of SIKLOS has been assessed in 405 pediatric patients with sickle cell disease from 2 - 18 years of age and 1077 adults in the European Sickle Cell Disease prospective Cohort study ESCORT - HU .
The most frequently reported adverse reactions in ESCORT - HU were infections and myelosuppression , with mild to moderate neutropenia as the most common manifestation .
Other adverse reactions include skin and subcutaneous disorders ( skin depigmentation / melanonychia , skin rash , alopecia ) , gastrointestinal disorders , vitamin D deficiency and headache .
At least one serious adverse reaction was reported in 33 % of the 405 pediatric patients and 32 % of the 1077 adults with sickle cell disease in ESCORT - HU .
The most frequent serious adverse reactions were infections ( 18 % ) , and blood and lymphatic system disorders ( 9 % ) in children , including serious neutropenia ( 3 . 2 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 3 % ) and anemia ( 3 % ) .
Other reported serious adverse reactions were gastrointestinal disorders ( 3 . 2 % ) , fever ( 2 . 5 % ) and nervous system disorders ( 4 % ) , including headache ( 2 . 7 % ) .
Among adults , the most frequent serious adverse reactions were infections ( 12 . 9 % ) , respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders ( 5 . 8 % ) , blood and lymphatic disorders ( 4 . 8 % ) , nervous system disorders ( 3 . 6 % ) , and general disorders and administration site disorders ( 3 . 1 % ) .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Blood and lymphatic system disorders : macrocytosis , hemolytic anemia in patients who are treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders .
• Gastrointestinal disorders : vomiting , gastrointestinal ulcer , severe hypomagnesemia • Hepatobiliary disorders : elevation of hepatic enzymes • Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : skin reactions ( oral , ungula and cutaneous pigmentation ) , oral mucositis , rash , melanonychia , • Reproductive system and breast disorders : oligospermia , azoospermia , amenorrhea 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Increased Toxicity with Concomitant Use of Antiretroviral Drugs Pancreatitis Pancreatitis ( including fatal cases ) have occurred in patients with HIV infection during therapy with hydroxyurea and didanosine , with or without stavudine .
Hydroxyurea is not indicated for the treatment of HIV infection ; however , if patients with HIV infection are treated with hydroxyurea , and in particular , in combination with didanosine and / or stavudine , monitor closely for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis .
Permanently discontinue therapy with hydroxyurea in patients who develop signs and symptoms of pancreatitis .
Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV infection treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral drugs .
Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea , didanosine , and stavudine .
Avoid this combination .
Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy , which was severe in some cases , has been reported in patients with HIV infection receiving hydroxyurea in combination with antiretroviral drugs , including didanosine , with or without stavudine .
7 . 2 Concomitant Use of Live Virus Vaccine Concomitant use of SIKLOS with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the vaccine virus and / or may increase the adverse reactions of the vaccine virus , because normal defense mechanisms may be suppressed by SIKLOS therapy .
Vaccination with a live vaccine in a patient taking SIKLOS may result in severe infections .
Generally , the patient ' s antibody response to vaccines may be decreased .
Treatment with SIKLOS and concomitant immunization with live virus vaccines should only be performed if benefits clearly outweigh potential risks .
Consider consultation with a specialist .
7 . 3 Test Interference Interference with Uric Acid , Urea , or Lactic Acid Assays Studies have shown that there is an analytical interference of SIKLOS with the enzymes ( urease , uricase , and lactate dehydrogenase ) used in the determination of urea , uric acid , and lactic acid , rendering falsely elevated results of these in patients treated with SIKLOS .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise women to stop breastfeeding while taking SIKLOS .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary SIKLOS can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies and the drug ' s mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no studies with the use of SIKLOS in pregnant women , and limited available data on SIKLOS use during pregnancy are insufficient to inform drug - associated risks .
Drugs which affect DNA synthesis , such as hydroxyurea , may be potential mutagenic agents .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of hydroxyurea to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis produced embryotoxic and teratogenic effects at doses 0 . 8 times and 0 . 3 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis .
In rats and rabbits , fetal malformations were observed with partially ossified cranial bones , absence of eye sockets , hydrocephaly , bipartite sternebrae , and missing lumbar vertebrae .
Embryotoxicity was characterized by decreased fetal viability , reduced live litter sizes , and developmental delays ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % – 4 % and 15 % – 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal adverse reactions Although the data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effects on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus / newborn , patients on SIKLOS should be made aware of the potential risks to the fetus .
Based on the limited amount of available information , in case of an exposure to SIKLOS of pregnant female patients or pregnant partners of male patients , treated by SIKLOS , a careful follow - up with adequate clinical , biological and ultrasonographic examinations should be considered .
Data Human Data According to a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 123 adult patients treated with hydroxyurea , twenty - three pregnancies have been reported from 15 women treated with hydroxyurea and partners of 3 men not using barrier contraception treated with hydroxyurea .
Most ( 61 % ) had no adverse developmental outcomes .
In the other cases with known evolution , pregnancy had been interrupted either voluntarily or upon medical advice .
In retrospective cohorts of 352 children and adolescents with sickle cell disease older than 2 years treated with hydroxyurea for a period of up to 12 years , 3 pregnancies under hydroxyurea were reported with no adverse developmental outcomes .
From post - marketing data of SIKLOS , 3 pregnancies have been reported while the father was treated with SIKLOS and 16 pregnancies have been reported in 15 females treated with SIKLOS .
Among the 13 cases with known evolution , 5 pregnancies had no adverse developmental outcomes , 4 led to premature birth , and 4 were early terminated .
Animal Data Hydroxyurea has been demonstrated to be a potent teratogen in a wide variety of animal models , including mice , hamsters , cats , miniature swine , dogs , and monkeys at doses within 1 - fold of the human dose given on a mg / m2 basis .
Hydroxyurea is embryotoxic and causes fetal malformations ( partially ossified cranial bones , absence of eye sockets , hydrocephaly , bipartite sternebrae , missing lumbar vertebrae ) at 180 mg / kg / day ( about 0 . 8 times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis ) in rats and at 30 mg / kg / day ( about 0 . 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis ) in rabbits .
Embryotoxicity was characterized by decreased fetal viability , reduced live litter sizes , and developmental delays .
Hydroxyurea crosses the placenta .
Single doses of ≥ 375 mg / kg ( about 1 . 7 times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis ) to rats caused growth retardation and impaired learning ability .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether SIKLOS is excreted in human milk , the effects of SIKLOS on the breastfed child , or the effects of SIKLOS on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from SIKLOS , including carcinogenicity , advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with SIKLOS .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing SIKLOS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating SIKLOS therapy .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with SIKLOS for at least 6 months after therapy .
Advise females to immediately report pregnancy .
Males SIKLOS may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue , resulting in possible genetic abnormalities .
Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and after treatment with SIKLOS for at least 6 months after therapy [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and humans , male fertility may be compromised by treatment with SIKLOS .
Azoospermia or oligospermia , sometimes reversible , has been observed in men .
Before the start of therapy , inform male patients about the possibility of sperm conservation [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of SIKLOS have been established in pediatric patients aged 2 - 18 years with sickle cell anemia with recurrent moderate to severe painful crises .
Use of SIKLOS in these age groups is supported by evidence from a non - interventional cohort study , the European Sickle Cell Disease prospective Cohort study , ESCORT - HU , in which 405 pediatric patients ages 2 to < 18 were enrolled .
Among the 405 pediatric patients treated with SIKLOS , 274 were children ( 2 - 11 ) and 108 were adolescents ( 12 - 16 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Continuous follow - up of the growth of treated children is recommended .
Pediatric patients aged 2 - 16 years had a higher risk of neutropenia than patients more than 16 years old .
The safety and effectiveness of SIKLOS have not been established in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The exposure to SIKLOS is higher in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL / min .
Reduce dosage and closely monitor the hematologic parameters when SIKLOS is to be administered to these patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Monitor hematologic parameters more frequently in patients with hepatic impairment receiving SIKLOS .
10 OVERDOSAGE Acute mucocutaneous toxicity has been reported in patients receiving hydroxyurea at doses several times above the therapeutic dose .
Soreness , violet erythema , oedema on palms and soles followed by scaling of hand and feet , severe generalized hyperpigmentation of the skin and stomatitis have been observed .
In patients with sickle cell anemia , neutropenia was reported in isolated cases of hydroxyurea overdose ( 1 . 43 times and 8 . 57 times of the maximum recommended dose of 35 mg / kg b . w . / day ) .
Monitor blood counts weekly until recovery .
Treatment of overdose consists of gastric lavage , followed by symptomatic treatment and control of bone marrow function .
11 DESCRIPTION SIKLOS ( hydroxyurea ) is an antimetabolite that is available for oral use as functionally scored 100 mg film - coated tablet and functionally triple - scored 1 , 000 mg film - coated tablet containing 100 and 1 , 000 mg of hydroxyurea , respectively .
Inactive ingredients include silicified microcrystalline cellulose , sodium stearyl fumarate , and film - coating agent amino methacrylate copolymer .
Hydroxyurea is a white crystalline powder .
It has a molecular weight of 76 . 05 .
Its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which hydroxyurea produces its cytotoxic and cytoreductive effects is not known .
However , various studies support the hypothesis that hydroxyurea causes an immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis by acting as a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor , without interfering with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or of protein .
The mechanisms by which SIKLOS produces its beneficial effects in patients with sickle cell Anemia ( SCA ) are uncertain .
Known pharmacologic effects of SIKLOS that may contribute to its beneficial effects include increasing hemoglobin F levels in red blood cells ( RBCs ) , decreasing neutrophils , increasing the water content of RBCs , increasing deformability of sickled cells , and altering the adhesion of RBCs to endothelium .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The correlation between hydroxyurea concentrations , reduction of crisis rate , and increase in HbF , is not known .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Mean peak plasma concentrations and AUCs increase more than proportionally with increase of dose .
There is no drug accumulation upon once daily dosing of hydroxyurea .
Absorption Following oral administration , hydroxyurea reaches peak plasma concentrations in 1 to 4 hours .
The oral bioavailability of hydroxyurea was reported to be 85 - 100 % .
Effect of Food There are no data on the effect of food on the absorption of hydroxyurea .
Distribution Hydroxyurea distributes throughout the body with a volume of distribution approximating total body water .
Hydroxyurea concentrates in leukocytes and erythrocytes .
Elimination Half - life of hydroxyurea is about 2 - 4 hours .
Metabolism Up to 60 % of an oral dose undergoes conversion through saturable hepatic metabolism and a minor pathway of degradation by urease found in intestinal bacteria .
Excretion The percentage of the dose excreted in urine was approximately 40 % in pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia .
Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of hydroxyurea was assessed in adult patients with sickle cell anemia and renal impairment .
Patients with normal renal function ( creatinine clearance [ CrCl ] > 80 mL / min ) , mild ( CrCl 50 - 80 mL / min ) , moderate ( CrCl = 30 - < 50 mL / min ) , or severe ( < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment received a single oral dose of 15 mg / kg hydroxyurea .
Creatinine clearance values were obtained using 24 - hour urine collections .
Patients with ESRD received two doses of 15 mg / kg separated by 7 days ; the first was given following a 4 - hour hemodialysis session , the second prior to hemodialysis .
The exposure to hydroxyurea ( mean AUC ) in patients with CrCl < 60 mL / min and those with ESRD was 64 % higher than in patients with normal renal function ( CrCl > 60 mL / min ) .
Reduce the dose of SIKLOS when it is administered to patients with creatinine clearance of < 60 mL / min or with ESRD following hemodialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with Hepatic impairment There are no data that support specific guidance for dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment .
Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of hydroxyurea is similar between children ( 4 to 17 years ) and adults .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Conventional long - term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydroxyurea have not been performed .
However , hydroxyurea is presumed to be a transspecies carcinogen .
Intraperitoneal administration of 125 to 250 mg / kg hydroxyurea ( about 0 . 6 - 1 . 2 times the maximum recommended human oral daily dose on a mg / m2 basis ) thrice weekly for 6 months to female rats increased the incidence of mammary tumors in rats surviving to 18 months compared to control .
Hydroxyurea is mutagenic in vitro to bacteria , fungi , protozoa , and mammalian cells .
Hydroxyurea is clastogenic in vitro ( hamster cells , human lymphoblasts ) and in vivo ( SCE assay in rodents , mouse micronucleus assay ) .
Hydroxyurea causes the transformation of rodent embryo cells to a tumorigenic phenotype [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 ) ] .
Hydroxyurea administered to male rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( about 0 . 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis ) produced testicular atrophy , decreased spermatogenesis and significantly reduced their ability to impregnate females [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Pediatric Patients with Sickle Cell Disease The efficacy of SIKLOS was assessed in the European Sickle Cell Disease Cohort study ( ESCORT HU ) [ NCT02516579 ] .
This is an open - label single - arm study of 405 pediatric patients with sickle cell disease from 2 - 18 years of age , of which 141 had not been previously treated with hydroxyurea prior to enrollment .
Evaluable patients had at least 12 months follow - up ( median [ range ] 23 months [ 12 , 80 ] ) .
Median ( range ) hemoglobin F percentages were 5 . 6 % ( 1 . 3 , 15 . 0 ) at baseline and 12 . 8 % ( 2 . 1 , 37 . 2 ) at least 6 months ( the value closest to 6 months collected between 5 and 14 months ) after initiation of SIKLOS treatment , with median ( range ) change of 5 . 9 % ( - 2 . 2 , 34 . 7 ) in 47 patients .
Median ( range ) hemoglobin levels were 8 . 2 g / dL ( 3 . 7 , 14 . 2 ) at baseline , 8 . 8 g / dL ( 0 . 7 , 13 . 1 ) at 6 months ( the value closest to 6 months collected between 5 and 7 months ) , and 8 . 9 g / dL ( 5 . 5 , 13 . 2 ) at 12 months ( the value closest to 12 months collected between 10 and 14 months ) after initiation of SIKLOS treatment .
The median ( range ) change was 0 . 5 g / dL ( - 4 . 6 , 6 . 1 ) in 63 patients at 6 months ( the post - baseline value closest to 6 months collected between 5 and 7 months ) and 0 . 7 g / dL ( - 6 . 4 , 6 . 0 ) in 83 patients at 12 months ( the post - baseline value closest to 12 months collected between 10 and 14 months ) after initiation of SIKLOS treatment .
Among pediatric patients not previously treated with hydroxyurea prior to enrollment and analyzable for efficacy ( N = 141 ) , the percentage of patients with at least one vaso - occlusive episode , one episode of acute chest syndrome , one hospitalization due to SCD or one blood transfusion decreased after 12 months of SIKLOS treatment ( Table 4 ) .
