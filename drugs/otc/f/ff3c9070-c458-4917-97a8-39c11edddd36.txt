1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE MoviPrep ® is indicated for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adults 18 years of age or older .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The MoviPrep dose for colon cleansing for adult patients is 2 liters ( approximately 64 ounces ) of MoviPrep solution ( with 1 additional liter of clear fluids ) taken orally prior to the colonoscopy in one of the following ways : • Split - dose MoviPrep regimen : The evening before the colonoscopy , take the first liter of MoviPrep solution over one hour ( one 8 ounce glass every 15 minutes ) and then drink 0 . 5 liters ( approximately 16 ounces ) of clear fluid .
Then , on the morning of the colonoscopy , take the second liter of MoviPrep solution over one hour and then drink 0 . 5 liters of clear liquid at least one hour prior to the start of the colonoscopy ; or • Evening only ( Full - dose ) MoviPrep regimen : Around 6 PM in the evening before the colonoscopy , take the first liter of MoviPrep solution over one hour ( one 8 ounce glass every 15 minutes ) and then about 1 . 5 hours later take the second liter of MoviPrep solution over one hour .
In addition , take 1 liter ( approximately 32 ounces ) of additional clear liquid during the evening before the colonoscopy .
Preparation of the MoviPrep solution : MoviPrep solution is prepared by emptying the contents of 1 pouch A and 1 pouch B into a suitable glass container ( or the container provided ) and adding to the container 1 liter of lukewarm water .
Mix the solution to ensure that the ingredients are completely dissolved .
If the patient prefers , the MoviPrep solution can be refrigerated prior to drinking .
The reconstituted solution should be used within 24 hours .
After consumption of the first liter of MoviPrep solution , the above mixing procedure should be repeated with the second pouch A and pouch B to reconstitute the second liter of the MoviPrep solution .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS MoviPrep is available in a carton that contains 4 separate pouches ( 2 of pouch A and 2 of pouch B ) .
Each pouch A contains 100 grams of polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 3350 , NF , 7 . 5 grams of sodium sulfate , USP , 2 . 691 grams of sodium chloride , USP , and 1 . 015 grams of potassium chloride , USP , plus the following excipients : aspartame , NF ( sweetener ) , acesulfame potassium , NF ( sweetener ) , and lemon flavoring .
Each pouch B contains 4 . 7 grams of ascorbic acid , USP and 5 . 9 grams of sodium ascorbate , USP .
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS MoviPrep is contraindicated in patients who have had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to any of its components .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS MoviPrep should be used with caution in patients with severe ulcerative colitis , ileus , gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation , gastric retention , toxic colitis , or toxic megacolon General Patients with impaired gag reflex and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration should be observed during the administration of MoviPrep .
If a patient experiences severe bloating , abdominal distention , or abdominal pain , administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate .
If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected , appropriate tests should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of MoviPrep ® .
Phenylketonurics : MoviPrep contains phenylalanine – a maximum of 2 . 33 mg of phenylalanine per treatment .
No additional ingredients ( e . g . , flavorings ) should be added to the MoviPrep solution .
Since MoviPrep contains sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid , MoviPrep should be used with caution in patients with glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( G - 6 - PD ) deficiency especially G - 6 - PD deficiency patients with an active infection , with a history of hemolysis , or taking concomitant medications known to precipitate hemolytic reactions .
5 . 1 SeizuresThere have been rare reports of generalized tonic - clonic seizures associated with use of polyethylene glycol colon preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures .
The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities ( e . g . , hyponatremia , hypokalemia ) .
The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities .
Therefore , MoviPrep should be used with caution in patients using concomitant medications that increase the risk of electrolyte abnormalities [ such as diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) - inhibitors ] or in patients with known or suspected hyponatremia .
Consider performing baseline and post - colonoscopy laboratory tests ( sodium , potassium , calcium , creatinine , and BUN ) in these patients .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6 . 1 Clinical Studies ExperienceIn the MoviPrep trials , abdominal distension , anal discomfort , thirst , nausea , and abdominal pain were some of the most common adverse reactions to MoviPrep administration .
Since diarrhea was considered as a part of the efficacy of MoviPrep , diarrhea was not defined as an adverse reaction in the clinical studies .
Tables 1 and 2 display the most common drug - related adverse reactions of MoviPrep and its comparator in the controlled MoviPrep trials .

These adverse events included upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a Mallory - Weiss tear , esophageal perforation , asystole , and acute pulmonary edema after aspirating the PEG - based preparation .
6 . 2 Postmarketing ExperienceIn addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials , the following adverse events have been identified during post - approval use of MoviPrep .
Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness , frequency of reporting or causal connection to MoviPrep , or a combination of these factors .
General : Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis , rash , urticaria , lip and facial swelling , dyspnea , chest tightness and throat tightness .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral medication administered within 1 hour of the start of administration of MoviPrep may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract and the medication may not be absorbed .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy : Teratogenic EffectsPregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been performed with MoviPrep .
It is also not known if MoviPrep can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity .
MoviPrep should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing MothersBecause many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when MoviPrep is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric UseThe safety and effectiveness of MoviPrep in pediatric patients has not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric UseOf the 413 patients in clinical studies receiving MoviPrep , 91 ( 22 % ) patients were aged 65 or older , while 25 ( 6 % ) patients were over 75 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric patients and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reported cases of overdose with MoviPrep .
Purposeful or gross accidental ingestion of more than the recommended dose of MoviPrep might be expected to lead to severe electrolyte disturbances , including hyponatremia and / or hypokalemia , as well as dehydration and hypovolemia , with signs and symptoms of these disturbances .
The patient who has taken an overdose should be monitored carefully , and treated symptomatically for complications until stable .

The pharmacokinetics of MoviPrep have not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of FertilityLong - term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential have not been performed with MoviPrep ® .
Studies to evaluate potential for impairment of fertility or mutagenic potential have not been performed with MoviPrep ® .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The colon cleansing efficacy and safety of MoviPrep was evaluated in two randomized , actively - controlled , multi - center , investigator - blinded , phase 3 trials in patients scheduled to have an elective colonoscopy .
In the first study , patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation treatments : 1 ) 2 liters of MoviPrep with 1 additional liter of clear fluid split into two doses ( during the evening before and the morning of the colonoscopy ) and 2 ) 4 liters of polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes solution ( 4 L PEG + E ) split into two doses ( during the evening before and the morning of the colonoscopy ) .
Patients were allowed to have a morning breakfast , a light lunch , clear soup and / or plain yogurt for dinner .
Dinner had to be completed at least one hour prior to initiation of the colon preparation administration .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with effective colon cleansing as judged by blinded gastroenterologists on the basis of videotapes recorded during the colonoscopy .
The blinded gastroenterologists graded the colon cleansing twice ( during introduction and withdrawal of the colonoscope ) and the poorer of the two assessments was used in the primary efficacy analysis .
The efficacy analysis included 308 adult patients who had an elective colonoscopy .
Patients ranged in age from 18 to 88 years old ( mean age about 59 years old ) with 52 % female and 48 % male patients .
Table 3 displays the results .

4 L PEG + E ' s responder rate was not significantly higher than MoviPrep ' s responder rate .
¶ 4 L PEG + E is 4 Liter Polyethylene Glycol plus Electrolytes Solution In the second study , patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation treatments : 1 ) 2 liters of MoviPrep with 1 additional liter of clear fluid in the evening prior to the colonoscopy and 2 ) 90 mL of oral sodium phosphate solution ( 90 mL OSPS ) with at least 2 liters of additional clear fluid during the day and evening prior to the colonoscopy .
Patients randomized to MoviPrep therapy were allowed to have a morning breakfast ; a light lunch ; and clear soup and / or plain yogurt for dinner .
Dinner had to be completed at least one hour prior to initiation of the colon preparation administration .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with effective colon cleansing as judged by the colonoscopist and one blinded gastroenterologist ( on the basis of videotapes recorded during the colonoscopy ) .
In case of a discrepancy between the colonoscopist and the blinded gastroenterologist , a second blinded gastroenterologist made the final efficacy determination .
The efficacy analysis included 280 adult patients who had an elective colonoscopy .
Patients ranged in age from 21 to 76 years old ( mean age about 53 years old ) with 47 % female and 53 % male patients .
