of Potassium / 220 mL ISMOTIC Solution Isosorbide , the osmotic agent in ISMOTIC , is a dihydric alcohol with the formula C6H10O4 represented by the structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Isosorbide is rapidly absorbed after oral administration .
It is essentially nonmetabolized , and in the circulation , it contributes to the tonicity of the blood until it is eliminated by the kidney unchanged .
While in the blood , isosorbide acts as an osmotic agent to promote redistribution of water toward the circulation with ultimate elimination in the urine .
The physical action of ISMOTIC is similar to that of other osmotic drugs .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE For the short - term reduction of intraocular pressure .
May be used prior to and after intraocular surgery .
May be used to interrupt an acute attack of glaucoma .
CONTRAINDICATIONS • Well - established anuria • Severe dehydration • Frank or impending acute pulmonary edema • Severe cardiac decompensation • Hypersensitivity to any component of this preparation WARNINGS • With repeated doses , consideration should be given to maintenance of adequate fluid and electrolyte balance .
• If urinary output continues to decrease , the patient ’ s clinical status should be closely reviewed .
Accumulation of ISMOTIC may result in overexpansion of the extracellular fluid .
PRECAUTIONS General For oral use only – not for injection .
Repetitive doses should be used with caution particularly in patients with diseases associated with salt retention .
Ensure that patient ’ s bladder has been emptied prior to surgery .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted in animals or in humans to evaluate the potential of these effects .
Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Reproduction ( fertility and teratology ) studies have been performed in rats at doses approximately 5 times the recommended initial human dose of 1 . 5 gm / kg body weight and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to isosorbide .
Teratology studies have been performed with rabbits and rats given daily oral doses of isosorbide at 6 . 5 and 10 times , respectively , the recommended initial human dose during organogenesis without evidence of harm to the fetus .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal studies are not always predictive of human responses , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in breast milk , caution should be exercised when isosorbide is administered to a nursing mother .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Nausea , vomiting , headache , confusion , and disorientation may occur .
Occurrences of syncope , gastric discomfort , lethargy , vertigo , thirst , dizziness , hiccups , hypernatremia , hyperosmolarity , irritability , rash and light - headedness have been reported .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended initial dose of isosorbide is 1 . 5 gm / kg body weight ( equivalent to 1 . 5 mL / lb .
of body weight ) .
The onset of action is usually within 30 minutes while the maximum effect is expected at 1 to 1 1 / 2 hours .
The useful dose range is 1 to 3 gm / kg body weight and the drug effect will persist up to 5 to 6 hours .
Use two to four times a day as indicated .
Palatability may be improved if the medication is poured over cracked ice and sipped .
