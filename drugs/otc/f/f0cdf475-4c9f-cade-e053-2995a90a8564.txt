1 . 7 Usage To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Linezolid Injection and other antibacterial drugs , Linezolid Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage , Route , and Frequency of Administration Infection Pediatric Patients ( Birth through 11 years of age ) Adults and Adolescents ( 12 years and older ) Duration ( days ) Nosocomial pneumonia 10 mg / kg intravenous every 8 hours 600 mg intravenous every 12 hours 10 to 14 Community - acquired pneumonia , including concurrent bacteremia Complicated skin and skin structure infections Vancomycin - resistant Enterococcus faecium infections , including concurrent bacteremia 10 mg / kg intravenous every 8 hours 600 mg intravenous every 12 hours 14 to 28 2 . 1 General Dosage and Administration The recommended dosage for Linezolid Injection formulations for the treatment of infections is described in Table 1 .
Table 1 Dosage Guidelines for Linezolid Injection Dosage , Route , and Frequency of Administration Infection * Pediatric Patients ( Birth through 11 years of age ) Adults and Adolescents ( 12 years and older ) Duration ( days ) Nosocomial pneumonia 10 mg / kg intravenous every 8 hours 600 mg intravenous every 12 hours 10 to 14 Community - acquired pneumonia , including concurrent bacteremia Complicated skin and skin structure infections Vancomycin - resistant Enterococcus faecium infections , including concurrent bacteremia 10 mg / kg intravenous every 8 hours 600 mg intravenous every 12 hours 14 to 28 * Due to the designated pathogens [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] † Neonates less than 7 days : Most pre - term neonates less than 7 days of age ( gestational age less than 34 weeks ) have lower systemic linezolid clearance values and larger AUC values than many full - term neonates and older infants .
These neonates should be initiated with a dosing regimen of 10 mg / kg every 12 hours .
Consideration may be given to the use of 10 mg / kg every 8 hours regimen in neonates with a sub - optimal clinical response .
All neonatal patients should receive 10 mg / kg every 8 hours by 7 days of life [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dose adjustment is necessary when switching from intravenous to oral administration .
2 . 2 Intravenous Administration Linezolid Injection is supplied in single - dose , ready - to - use infusion bags .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration .
Check for minute leaks by firmly squeezing the bag .
If leaks are detected , discard the solution , as sterility may be impaired .
Keep the infusion bags in the overwrap until ready to use .
Store at room temperature .
Protect from freezing .
Linezolid Injection may exhibit a yellow color that can intensify over time without adversely affecting potency .
Linezolid Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 30 to 120 minutes .
Do not use this intravenous infusion bag in series connections .
Additives should not be introduced into this solution .
If Linezolid Injection is to be given concomitantly with another drug , each drug should be given separately in accordance with the recommended dosage and route of administration for each product .
Discard unused portion .
If the same intravenous line is used for sequential infusion of several drugs , the line should be flushed before and after infusion of Linezolid Injection with an infusion solution compatible with Linezolid Injection and with any other drug ( s ) administered via this common line .
2 . 3 Compatibilities Compatible intravenous solutions include 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP , 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP , and Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection , USP .
2 . 4 Incompatibilities Physical incompatibilities resulted when Linezolid Injection was combined with the following drugs during simulated Y - site administration : amphotericin B , chlorpromazine HCl , diazepam , pentamidine isothionate , erythromycin lactobionate , phenytoin sodium , and trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole .
Additionally , chemical incompatibility resulted when Linezolid Injection was combined with ceftriaxone sodium .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Linezolid Injection : 600 mg / 300 mL ( 2 mg / mL ) linezolid single - dose , ready - to - use flexible plastic infusion bags in a foil laminate overwrap .
• Injection : 600 mg / 300 mL ( 2 mg / mL ) linezolid ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Known hypersensitivity to linezolid or any of the other product components .
( 4 . 1 ) • Patients taking any monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) or within two weeks of taking an MAOI .
( 4 . 2 ) 4 . 1 Hypersensitivity Linezolid formulations are contraindicated for use in patients who have known hypersensitivity to linezolid or any of the other product components .
4 . 2 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Linezolid should not be used in patients taking any medicinal product which inhibits monoamine oxidases A or B ( e . g . , phenelzine , isocarboxazid ) or within two weeks of taking any such medicinal product .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myelosuppression : Monitor complete blood counts weekly .
Consider discontinuation in patients who develop or have worsening myelosuppression .
( 5 . 1 ) • Peripheral and Optic Neuropathy : Reported primarily in patients treated for longer than 28 days .
If patients experience symptoms of visual impairment , prompt ophthalmic evaluation is recommended .
( 5 . 2 ) • Serotonin Syndrome : Monitor patients taking serotonergic agents , including antidepressants and opioids , for signs of serotonin syndrome .
Patients taking serotonergic antidepressants should receive Linezolid Injection only if no other therapies are available .
Discontinue serotonergic antidepressants and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of both serotonin syndrome and antidepressant discontinuation .
( 5 . 3 ) • A mortality imbalance was seen in an investigational study in linezolid - treated patients with catheter - related bloodstream infections .
( 5 . 4 ) • Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea : Evaluate if diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 5 ) • Potential interactions producing elevation of blood pressure : monitor blood pressure .
( 5 . 6 ) • Hypoglycemia : Postmarketing cases of symptomatic hypoglycemia have been reported in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents .
( 5 . 9 ) • Hyponatremia and / or Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion ( SIADH ) : Monitor serum sodium levels regularly in patients at risk of hyponatremia and / or SIADH .
( 5 . 10 ) 5 . 1 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression ( including anemia , leukopenia , pancytopenia , and thrombocytopenia ) has been reported in patients receiving linezolid .
In cases where the outcome is known , when linezolid was discontinued , the affected hematologic parameters have risen toward pretreatment levels .
Complete blood counts should be monitored weekly in patients who receive linezolid , particularly in those who receive linezolid for longer than two weeks , those with pre - existing myelosuppression , those receiving concomitant drugs that produce bone marrow suppression , or those with a chronic infection who have received previous or concomitant antibacterial drug therapy .
Discontinuation of therapy with linezolid should be considered in patients who develop or have worsening myelosuppression .
5 . 2 Peripheral and Optic Neuropathy Peripheral and optic neuropathies have been reported in patients treated with linezolid , primarily in those patients treated for longer than the maximum recommended duration of 28 days .
In cases of optic neuropathy that progressed to loss of vision , patients were treated for extended periods beyond the maximum recommended duration .
Visual blurring has been reported in some patients treated with linezolid for less than 28 days .
Peripheral and optic neuropathy has also been reported in children .
If patients experience symptoms of visual impairment , such as changes in visual acuity , changes in color vision , blurred vision , or visual field defect , prompt ophthalmic evaluation is recommended .
Visual function should be monitored in all patients taking linezolid for extended periods ( ≥ 3 months ) and in all patients reporting new visual symptoms regardless of length of therapy with linezolid .
If peripheral or optic neuropathy occurs , the continued use of linezolid in these patients should be weighed against the potential risks .
5 . 3 Serotonin Syndrome Spontaneous reports of serotonin syndrome including fatal cases associated with the co - administration of linezolid and serotonergic agents , including antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , have been reported .
Unless clinically appropriate and patients are carefully observed for signs and / or symptoms of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome - like ( NMS - like ) reactions , linezolid should not be administered to patients with carcinoid syndrome and / or patients taking any of the following medications : serotonin re - uptake inhibitors , tricyclic antidepressants , bupropion , buspirone , serotonin 5 - HT1 receptor agonists ( triptans ) , or opioids , including meperidine [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In some cases , a patient already receiving a serotonergic antidepressant or buspirone may require urgent treatment with linezolid .
If alternatives to linezolid are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome or NMS - like reactions , the serotonergic antidepressant should be stopped promptly and linezolid administered .
The patient should be monitored for two weeks ( five weeks if fluoxetine was taken ) or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid , whichever comes first .
Symptoms of serotonin syndrome or NMS - like reactions include hyperthermia , rigidity , myoclonus , autonomic instability , and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma .
The patient should also be monitored for discontinuation symptoms of the antidepressant ( see package insert of the specified agent ( s ) for a description of the associated discontinuation symptoms ) .
5 . 4 Mortality Imbalance in an Investigational Study in Patients with Catheter - Related Bloodstream Infections , Including Those with Catheter - site Infections An imbalance in mortality was seen in patients treated with linezolid relative to vancomycin / dicloxacillin / oxacillin in an open - label study in seriously ill patients with intravascular catheter - related infections [ 78 / 363 ( 21 . 5 % ) vs . 58 / 363 ( 16 . 0 % ) ; odds ratio 1 . 426 , 95 % CI 0 . 970 , 2 . 098 ] .
While causality has not been established , this observed imbalance occurred primarily in linezolid - treated patients in whom either Gram - negative pathogens , mixed Gram - negative and Gram - positive pathogens , or no pathogen were identified at baseline , but was not seen in patients with Gram - positive infections only .
Linezolid is not approved and should not be used for the treatment of patients with catheter - related bloodstream infections or catheter - site infections .
Linezolid has no clinical activity against Gram - negative pathogens and is not indicated for the treatment of Gram - negative infections .
It is critical that specific Gram - negative therapy be initiated immediately if a concomitant Gram - negative pathogen is documented or suspected [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
5 . 5 Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including linezolid , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibacterial drug treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 6 Potential Interactions Producing Elevation of Blood Pressure Unless patients are monitored for potential increases in blood pressure , linezolid should not be administered to patients with uncontrolled hypertension , pheochromocytoma , thyrotoxicosis and / or patients taking any of the following types of medications : directly and indirectly acting sympathomimetic agents ( e . g . , pseudoephedrine ) , vasopressive agents ( e . g . , epinephrine , norepinephrine ) , dopaminergic agents ( e . g . , dopamine , dobutamine ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Lactic Acidosis Lactic acidosis has been reported with the use of linezolid .
In reported cases , patients experienced repeated episodes of nausea and vomiting .
Patients who develop recurrent nausea or vomiting , unexplained acidosis , or a low bicarbonate level while receiving linezolid should receive immediate medical evaluation .
5 . 8 Convulsions Convulsions have been reported in patients when treated with linezolid .
In some of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures was reported .
5 . 9 Hypoglycemia Postmarketing cases of symptomatic hypoglycemia have been reported in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents when treated with linezolid , a reversible , nonselective MAO inhibitor .
Some MAO inhibitors have been associated with hypoglycemic episodes in diabetic patients receiving insulin or hypoglycemic agents .
While a causal relationship between linezolid and hypoglycemia has not been established , diabetic patients should be cautioned of potential hypoglycemic reactions when treated with linezolid .
If hypoglycemia occurs , a decrease in the dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent , or discontinuation of oral hypoglycemic agent , insulin , or linezolid may be required .
5 . 10 Hyponatremia and / or Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion ( SIADH ) Postmarketing cases of hyponatremia and / or Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion ( SIADH ) have been observed in patients treated with linezolid .
In reported cases , the signs and symptoms included confusion , somnolence , generalized weakness , and in severe cases led to respiratory failure and even death .
Monitor serum sodium levels regularly in the elderly , in patients taking diuretics , and in other patients at risk of hyponatremia and / or SIADH while taking linezolid .
If signs and symptoms of hyponatremia and / or SIADH occur , discontinue linezolid , and institute appropriate supportive measures .
5 . 12 Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria Prescribing linezolid in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( > 5 % of adult and / or pediatric patients treated with Linezolid Injection include : diarrhea , vomiting , headache , nausea , and anemia .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adults : The safety of linezolid formulations was evaluated in 2046 adult patients enrolled in seven Phase 3 comparator - controlled clinical trials , who were treated for up to 28 days .
Of the patients treated for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections ( uSSSIs ) , 25 . 4 % of linezolid - treated and 19 . 6 % of comparator - treated patients experienced at least one drug - related adverse event .
For all other indications , 20 . 4 % of linezolid - treated and 14 . 3 % of comparator - treated patients experienced at least one drug - related adverse event .
Table 2 shows the incidence of all - causality , treatment - emergent adverse reactions reported in at least 1 % of adult patients in these trials by dose of linezolid .

Of the patients treated for uSSSIs , 3 . 5 % of linezolid - treated and 2 . 4 % of comparator - treated patients discontinued treatment due to drug - related adverse events .
For all other indications , discontinuations due to drug - related adverse events occurred in 2 . 1 % of linezolid - treated and 1 . 7 % of comparator - treated patients .
The most common reported drug - related adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were nausea , headache , diarrhea , and vomiting .
Pediatric Patients : The safety of linezolid formulations was evaluated in 215 pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 11 years , and in 248 pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years ( 146 of these 248 were age 5 through 11 and 102 were age 12 to 17 ) .
These patients were enrolled in two Phase 3 comparator - controlled clinical trials and were treated for up to 28 days .
In the study of hospitalized pediatric patients ( birth through 11 years ) with Gram - positive infections , who were randomized 2 to 1 ( linezolid : vancomycin ) , mortality was 6 . 0 % ( 13 / 215 ) in the linezolid arm and 3 . 0 % ( 3 / 101 ) in the vancomycin arm .
However , given the severe underlying illness in the patient population , no causality could be established .
Of the pediatric patients treated for uSSSIs , 19 . 2 % of linezolid - treated and 14 . 1 % of comparator - treated patients experienced at least one drug - related adverse event .
For all other indications , 18 . 8 % of linezolid - treated and 34 . 3 % of comparator - treated patients experienced at least one drug - related adverse event .
Table 3 shows the incidence of all - causality , treatment - emergent adverse reactions reported in more than 1 % of pediatric patients ( and more than 1 patient ) in either treatment group in the comparator - controlled Phase 3 trials .

Patients 12 years or older received linezolid 600 mg by mouth every 12 hours or cefadroxil 500 mg by mouth every 12 hours .
† Patients from birth through 11 years of age received linezolid 10 mg / kg intravenously by mouth every 8 hours or vancomycin 10 to 15 mg / kg intravenously every 6 - 24 hours , depending on age and renal clearance .
Of the pediatric patients treated for uSSSIs , 1 . 6 % of linezolid - treated and 2 . 4 % of comparator - treated patients discontinued treatment due to drug - related adverse events .
For all other indications , discontinuations due to drug - related adverse events occurred in 0 . 9 % of linezolid - treated and 6 . 1 % of comparator - treated patients .
Laboratory Abnormalities : Linezolid has been associated with thrombocytopenia when used in doses up to and including 600 mg every 12 hours for up to 28 days .
In Phase 3 comparator - controlled trials , the percentage of adult patients who developed a substantially low platelet count ( defined as less than 75 % of lower limit of normal and / or baseline ) was 2 . 4 % ( range among studies : 0 . 3 to 10 . 0 % ) with linezolid and 1 . 5 % ( range among studies : 0 . 4 to 7 . 0 % ) with a comparator .
In a study of hospitalized pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 11 years , the percentage of patients who developed a substantially low platelet count ( defined as less than 75 % of lower limit of normal and / or baseline ) was 12 . 9 % with linezolid and 13 . 4 % with vancomycin .
In an outpatient study of pediatric patients aged from 5 through 17 years , the percentage of patients who developed a substantially low platelet count was 0 % with linezolid and 0 . 4 % with cefadroxil .
Thrombocytopenia associated with the use of linezolid appears to be dependent on duration of therapy ( generally greater than 2 weeks of treatment ) .
The platelet counts for most patients returned to the normal range / baseline during the follow - up period .
No related clinical adverse events were identified in Phase 3 clinical trials in patients developing thrombocytopenia .
Bleeding events were identified in thrombocytopenic patients in a compassionate use program for linezolid ; the role of linezolid in these events cannot be determined [ see Warning and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Changes seen in other laboratory parameters , without regard to drug relationship , revealed no substantial differences between linezolid and the comparators .
These changes were generally not clinically significant , did not lead to discontinuation of therapy , and were reversible .
The incidence of adult and pediatric patients with at least one substantially abnormal hematologic or serum chemistry value is presented in Tables 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of linezolid .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Myelosuppression ( including anemia , leukopenia , pancytopenia , and thrombocytopenia ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] ; sideroblastic anemia .
• Peripheral neuropathy , and optic neuropathy sometimes progressing to loss of vision [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• Lactic acidosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Although these reports have primarily been in patients treated for longer than the maximum recommended duration of 28 days , these events have also been reported in patients receiving shorter courses of therapy .
• Serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients receiving concomitant serotonergic agents , including antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and opioids , and linezolid [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Convulsions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
• Anaphylaxis , angioedema , bullous skin disorders including severe cutaneous adverse reactions ( SCAR ) such as toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens - Johnson syndrome , and hypersensitivity vasculitis .
• Superficial tooth discoloration and tongue discoloration have been reported with the use of linezolid .
The tooth discoloration was removable with professional dental cleaning ( manual descaling ) in cases with known outcome .
• Hypoglycemia , including symptomatic episodes [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
• Hyponatremia and / or Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion ( SIADH ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] .

7 . 2 Adrenergic and Serotonergic Agents Linezolid has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and serotonergic agents [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 , 5 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published and postmarketing case reports with linezolid use in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
When administered during organogenesis , linezolid did not cause malformations in mice , rats , or rabbits at maternal exposure levels approximately 6 . 5 times ( mice ) , equivalent to ( rats ) , or 0 . 06 times ( rabbits ) the clinical therapeutic exposure , based on AUCs .
However , embryo - fetal lethality was observed in mice at 6 . 5 times the estimated human exposure .
When female rats were dosed during organogenesis through lactation , postnatal survival of pups was decreased at doses approximately equivalent to the estimated human exposure based on AUCs ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In mice , embryo - fetal toxicities were observed only at doses that caused maternal toxicity ( clinical signs and reduced body weight gain ) .
An oral dose of 450 mg / kg / day given from Gestation Day ( GD ) 6 - 16 ( 6 . 5 times the estimated human exposure based on AUCs ) correlated with increased postimplantational embryo death , including total litter loss , decreased fetal body weights , and an increased incidence of costal cartilage fusion .
Neither maternal nor embryo - fetal toxicities were observed at doses up to 150 mg / kg / day .
Fetal malformations were not observed .
In rats , fetal toxicity was observed at 15 and 50 mg / kg / day administered orally from GD 6 - 17 ( exposures 0 . 22 times to approximately equivalent to the estimated human exposure , respectively , based on AUCs ) .
The effects consisted of decreased fetal body weights and reduced ossification of sternebrae , a finding often seen in association with decreased fetal body weights .
Fetal malformations were not observed .
Maternal toxicity , in the form of reduced body weight gain , was seen at 50 mg / kg / day .
In rabbits , reduced fetal body weight occurred only in the presence of maternal toxicity ( clinical signs , reduced body weight gain and food consumption ) when administered at an oral dose of 15 mg / kg / day given from GD 6 - 20 ( 0 . 06 times the estimated human exposure based on AUCs ) .
Fetal malformations were not observed .
When female rats were treated with 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately equivalent to the estimated human exposure based on AUCs ) of linezolid during pregnancy and lactation ( GD 6 through Lactation Day 20 ) , survival of pups was decreased on postnatal days 1 to 4 .
Male and female pups permitted to mature to reproductive age , when mated , showed an increase in preimplantation loss .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Linezolid is present in breast milk .
Based on data from available published case reports , the daily dose of linezolid that the infant would receive from breastmilk would be approximately 6 % to 9 % of the recommended therapeutic infant dose ( 10 mg / kg every 8 hours ) .
There is no information on the effects of linezolid on the breastfed infant ; however , diarrhea and vomiting were the most common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials in infants receiving linezolid therapeutically [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] and ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
There is no information on the effects of linezolid on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for linezolid and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from linezolid or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Advise lactating women to monitor a breastfed infant for diarrhea and vomiting .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings from studies in rats , linezolid may reversibly impair fertility in male patients [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of linezolid for the treatment of pediatric patients with the following infections are supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies in adults , pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients , and additional data from a comparator - controlled study of Gram - positive infections in pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 11 years [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] : • nosocomial pneumonia • complicated skin and skin structure infections • community - acquired pneumonia ( also supported by evidence from an uncontrolled study in patients ranging in age from 8 months through 12 years ) • vancomycin - resistant Enterococcus faecium infections The safety and effectiveness of linezolid for the treatment of pediatric patients with the following infection have been established in a comparator - controlled study in pediatric patients ranging in age from 5 through 17 years [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] : • uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus ( methicillin - susceptible strains only ) or Streptococcus pyogenes Pharmacokinetic information generated in pediatric patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts showed variable cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) linezolid concentrations following single and multiple dosing of linezolid ; therapeutic concentrations were not consistently achieved or maintained in the CSF .
Therefore , the use of linezolid for the empiric treatment of pediatric patients with central nervous system infections is not recommended .
The pharmacokinetics of linezolid have been evaluated in pediatric patients from birth to 17 years of age .
In general , weight - based clearance of linezolid gradually decreases with increasing age of pediatric patients .
However , in preterm ( gestational age < 34 weeks ) neonates < 7 days of age , linezolid clearance is often lower than in full - term neonates < 7 days of age .
Consequently , preterm neonates < 7 days of age may need an alternative linezolid dosing regimen of 10 mg / kg every 12 hours [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In limited clinical experience , 5 out of 6 ( 83 % ) pediatric patients with infections due to Gram - positive pathogens with minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) of 4 mcg / mL treated with linezolid had clinical cures .
However , pediatric patients exhibit wider variability in linezolid clearance and systemic exposure ( AUC ) compared with adults .
In pediatric patients with a sub - optimal clinical response , particularly those with pathogens with MIC of 4 mcg / mL , lower systemic exposure , site and severity of infection , and the underlying medical condition should be considered when assessing clinical response [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 2 , 046 patients treated with linezolid in Phase 3 comparator - controlled clinical trials , 589 ( 29 % ) were 65 years or older and 253 ( 12 % ) were 75 years or older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdosage , supportive care is advised , with maintenance of glomerular filtration .
Hemodialysis may facilitate more rapid elimination of linezolid .
In a Phase 1 clinical trial , approximately 30 % of a dose of linezolid was removed during a 3 - hour hemodialysis session beginning 3 hours after the dose of linezolid was administered .
Data are not available for removal of linezolid with peritoneal dialysis or hemoperfusion .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Linezolid is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a randomized , positive - and placebo - controlled crossover thorough QT study , 40 healthy subjects were administered a single linezolid 600 mg dose via a 1 hour IV infusion , a single linezolid 1 , 200 mg dose via a 1 hour IV infusion , placebo , and a single oral dose of positive control .
At both the 600 mg and 1 , 200 mg linezolid doses , no significant effect on QTc interval was detected at peak plasma concentration or at any other time .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The mean pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid in adults after single and multiple oral and intravenous doses are summarized in Table 8 .
Plasma concentrations of linezolid at steady - state after oral doses of 600 mg given every 12 hours are shown in Figure 1 .

Maximum plasma concentrations are reached approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing , and the absolute bioavailability is approximately 100 % .
Therefore , linezolid may be given orally or intravenously without dose adjustment .
Linezolid may be administered without regard to the timing of meals .
The time to reach the maximum concentration is delayed from 1 . 5 hours to 2 . 2 hours and C max is decreased by about 17 % when high fat food is given with linezolid .
However , the total exposure measured as AUC 0 - ∞ is similar under both conditions .
Distribution Animal and human pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that linezolid readily distributes to well - perfused tissues .
The plasma protein binding of linezolid is approximately 31 % and is concentration - independent .
The volume of distribution of linezolid at steady - state averaged 40 to 50 liters in healthy adult volunteers .
Linezolid concentrations have been determined in various fluids from a limited number of subjects in Phase 1 volunteer studies following multiple dosing of linezolid .
The ratio of linezolid in saliva relative to plasma was 1 . 2 to 1 and the ratio of linezolid in sweat relative to plasma was 0 . 55 to 1 .
Metabolism Linezolid is primarily metabolized by oxidation of the morpholine ring , which results in two inactive ring - opened carboxylic acid metabolites : the aminoethoxyacetic acid metabolite ( A ) , and the hydroxyethyl glycine metabolite ( B ) .
Formation of metabolite A is presumed to be formed via an enzymatic pathway whereas metabolite B is mediated by a non - enzymatic chemical oxidation mechanism in vitro .
In vitro studies have demonstrated that linezolid is minimally metabolized and may be mediated by human cytochrome P450 .
However , the metabolic pathway of linezolid is not fully understood .
Excretion Nonrenal clearance accounts for approximately 65 % of the total clearance of linezolid .
Under steady - state conditions , approximately 30 % of the dose appears in the urine as linezolid , 40 % as metabolite B , and 10 % as metabolite A .
The mean renal clearance of linezolid is 40 mL / min which suggests net tubular reabsorption .
Virtually no linezolid appears in the feces , while approximately 6 % of the dose appears in the feces as metabolite B , and 3 % as metabolite A .
A small degree of nonlinearity in clearance was observed with increasing doses of linezolid , which appears to be due to lower renal and nonrenal clearance of linezolid at higher concentrations .
However , the difference in clearance was small and was not reflected in the apparent elimination half - life .
Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of linezolid are not significantly altered in elderly patients ( 65 years or older ) .
Therefore , dose adjustment for geriatric patients is not necessary .
Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of linezolid following a single intravenous dose were investigated in pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 17 years ( including premature and full - term neonates ) , in healthy adolescent subjects ranging in age from 12 through 17 years , and in pediatric patients ranging in age from 1 week through 12 years .
The pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid are summarized in Table 9 for the pediatric populations studied and healthy adult subjects after administration of single intravenous doses .
The C max and the volume of distribution ( V ss ) of linezolid are similar regardless of age in pediatric patients .
However , plasma clearance of linezolid varies as a function of age .
With the exclusion of pre - term neonates less than one week of age , weight - based clearance is most rapid in the youngest age groups ranging from < 1 week old to 11 years , resulting in lower single - dose systemic exposure ( AUC ) and a shorter half - life as compared with adults .
As the age of pediatric patients increases , the weight - based clearance of linezolid gradually decreases , and by adolescence mean clearance values approach those observed for the adult population .
There is increased inter - subject variability in linezolid clearance and systemic drug exposure ( AUC ) across all pediatric age groups as compared with adults .
Similar mean daily AUC values were observed in pediatric patients from birth to 11 years of age dosed every 8 hours relative to adolescents or adults dosed every 12 hours .
Therefore , the dosage for pediatric patients up to 11 years of age should be 10 mg / kg every 8 hours .
Pediatric patients 12 years and older should receive 600 mg every 12 hours [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .

Plasma concentrations are higher in females than in males , which is partly due to body weight differences .
After a 600 - mg dose , mean oral clearance is approximately 38 % lower in females than in males .
However , there are no significant gender differences in mean apparent elimination - rate constant or half - life .
Thus , drug exposure in females is not expected to substantially increase beyond levels known to be well tolerated .
Therefore , dose adjustment by gender does not appear to be necessary .
Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of the parent drug , linezolid , are not altered in patients with any degree of renal impairment ; however , the two primary metabolites of linezolid accumulate in patients with renal impairment , with the amount of accumulation increasing with the severity of renal dysfunction ( see Table 10 ) .
The pharmacokinetics of linezolid and its two metabolites have also been studied in patients with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) receiving hemodialysis .
In the ESRD study , 14 patients were dosed with linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 . 5 days ( see Table 11 ) .
Because similar plasma concentrations of linezolid are achieved regardless of renal function , no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment .
However , given the absence of information on the clinical significance of accumulation of the primary metabolites , use of linezolid in patients with renal impairment should be weighed against the potential risks of accumulation of these metabolites .
Both linezolid and the two metabolites are eliminated by hemodialysis .
No information is available on the effect of peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid .
Approximately 30 % of a dose was eliminated in a 3 - hour hemodialysis session beginning 3 hours after the dose of linezolid was administered ; therefore , linezolid should be given after hemodialysis .

Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of linezolid are not altered in patients ( n = 7 ) with mild - to - moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class A or B ) .
On the basis of the available information , no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild - to - moderate hepatic impairment .
The pharmacokinetics of linezolid in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated .
Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Linezolid is not an inducer of cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) in rats .
In addition , linezolid does not inhibit the activities of clinically significant human CYP isoforms ( e . g . , 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 , 3A4 ) .
Therefore , linezolid is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs metabolized by these major enzymes .
Concurrent administration of linezolid does not substantially alter the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ( S ) - warfarin , which is extensively metabolized by CYP2C9 .
Drugs such as warfarin and phenytoin , which are CYP2C9 substrates , may be given with linezolid without changes in dosage regimen .
Antibacterial Drugs Aztreonam : The pharmacokinetics of linezolid or aztreonam are not altered when administered together .
Gentamicin : The pharmacokinetics of linezolid or gentamicin are not altered when administered together .
Antioxidants The potential for drug - drug interactions with linezolid and the antioxidants Vitamin C and Vitamin E was studied in healthy volunteers .
Subjects were administered a 600 mg oral dose of linezolid on Day 1 , and another 600 mg dose of linezolid on Day 8 .
On Days 2 - 9 , subjects were given either Vitamin C ( 1000 mg / day ) or Vitamin E ( 800 IU / day ) .
The AUC 0 - ∞ of linezolid increased 2 . 3 % when co - administered with Vitamin C and 10 . 9 % when co - administered with Vitamin E . No linezolid dose adjustment is recommended during co - administration with Vitamin C or Vitamin E . Strong CYP 3A4 Inducers Rifampin : The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid was evaluated in a study of 16 healthy adult males .
Volunteers were administered oral linezolid 600 mg twice daily for 5 doses with and without rifampin 600 mg once daily for 8 days .
Co - administration of rifampin with linezolid resulted in a 21 % decrease in linezolid Cmax [ 90 % CI , 15 % - 27 % ] and a 32 % decrease in linezolid AUC 0 - 12 [ 90 % CI , 27 % - 37 % ] .
The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown .
The mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood and may be related to the induction of hepatic enzymes .
Other strong inducers of hepatic enzymes ( e . g . carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital ) could cause a similar or smaller decrease in linezolid exposure .
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibition Linezolid is a reversible , nonselective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase .
Therefore , linezolid has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and serotonergic agents .
Adrenergic Agents Some individuals receiving linezolid may experience a reversible enhancement of the pressor response to indirect - acting sympathomimetic agents , vasopressor or dopaminergic agents .
Commonly used drugs such as phenylpropanolamine and pseudoephedrine have been specifically studied .
Initial doses of adrenergic agents , such as dopamine or epinephrine , should be reduced and titrated to achieve the desired response .
Tyramine : A significant pressor response has been observed in normal adult subjects receiving linezolid and tyramine doses of more than 100 mg .
Therefore , patients receiving linezolid need to avoid consuming large amounts of foods or beverages with high tyramine content [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Pseudoephedrine HCl or phenylpropanolamine HCl : A reversible enhancement of the pressor response of either pseudoephedrine HCl ( PSE ) or phenylpropanolamine HCl ( PPA ) is observed when linezolid is administered to healthy normotensive subjects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
A similar study has not been conducted in hypertensive patients .
The interaction studies conducted in normotensive subjects evaluated the blood pressure and heart rate effects of placebo , PPA or PSE alone , linezolid alone , and the combination of steady - state linezolid ( 600 mg every 12 hours for 3 days ) with two doses of PPA ( 25 mg ) or PSE ( 60 mg ) given 4 hours apart .
Heart rate was not affected by any of the treatments .
Blood pressure was increased with both combination treatments .
Maximum blood pressure levels were seen 2 to 3 hours after the second dose of PPA or PSE , and returned to baseline 2 to 3 hours after peak .
The results of the PPA study follow , showing the mean ( and range ) maximum systolic blood pressure in mm Hg : placebo = 121 ( 103 to 158 ) ; linezolid alone = 120 ( 107 to 135 ) ; PPA alone = 125 ( 106 to 139 ) ; PPA with linezolid = 147 ( 129 to 176 ) .
The results from the PSE study were similar to those in the PPA study .
The mean maximum increase in systolic blood pressure over baseline was 32 mm Hg ( range : 20 - 52 mm Hg ) and 38 mm Hg ( range : 18 - 79 mm Hg ) during co - administration of linezolid with pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine , respectively .
Serotonergic Agents Dextromethorphan : The potential drug - drug interaction with dextromethorphan was studied in healthy volunteers .
Subjects were administered dextromethorphan ( two 20 - mg doses given 4 hours apart ) with or without linezolid .
No serotonin syndrome effects ( confusion , delirium , restlessness , tremors , blushing , diaphoresis , hyperpyrexia ) have been observed in normal subjects receiving linezolid and dextromethorphan .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Linezolid is a synthetic antibacterial agent of the oxazolidinone class , which has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic Gram - positive bacteria .
The in vitro spectrum of activity of linezolid also includes certain Gram - negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria .
Linezolid binds to a site on the bacterial 23 S ribosomal RNA of the 50 S subunit and prevents the formation of a functional 70 S initiation complex , which is essential for bacterial reproduction .
The results of time - kill studies have shown linezolid to be bacteriostatic against enterococci and staphylococci .
For streptococci , linezolid was found to be bactericidal for the majority of isolates .
Resistance In vitro studies have shown that point mutations in the 23 S rRNA are associated with linezolid resistance .
Reports of vancomycinresistant Enterococcus faecium becoming resistant to linezolid during its clinical use have been published .
There are reports of Staphylococcus aureus ( methicillin - resistant ) developing resistance to linezolid during clinical use .
The linezolid resistance in these organisms is associated with a point mutation in the 23 S rRNA ( substitution of thymine for guanine at position 2576 ) of the organism .
Organisms resistant to oxazolidinones via mutations in chromosomal genes encoding 23 S rRNA or ribosomal proteins ( L3 and L4 ) are generally cross - resistant to linezolid .
Also linezolid resistance in staphylococci mediated by the enzyme methyltransferase has been reported .
This resistance is mediated by the cfr ( chloramphenicol - florfenicol ) gene located on a plasmid which is transferable between staphylococci .
Interaction with Other Antimicrobial Drugs In vitro studies have demonstrated additivity or indifference between linezolid and vancomycin , gentamicin , rifampin , imipenemcilastatin , aztreonam , ampicillin , or streptomycin .
Linezolid has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections [ See Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Gram - positive bacteria Enterococcus faecium ( vancomycin - resistant isolates only ) Staphylococcus aureus ( including methicillin - resistant isolates ) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
Greater than 90 % of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro MIC less than or equal to the linezolid - susceptible breakpoint for organisms of similar genus .
The safety and effectiveness of linezolid in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well - controlled clinical trials .
Gram - positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis ( including vancomycin - resistant isolates ) Enterococcus faecium ( vancomycin - susceptible isolates ) Staphylococcus epidermidis ( including methicillin - resistant isolates ) Staphylococcus haemolyticus Viridans group streptococci Gram - negative bacteria Pasteurella multocida Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug , please see : https : / / www . fda . gov / STIC .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Lifetime studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of linezolid .
Neither mutagenic nor clastogenic potential was found in a battery of tests including : assays for mutagenicity ( Ames bacterial reversion and CHO cell mutation ) , an in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis ( UDS ) assay , an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes , and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Linezolid did not affect the fertility or reproductive performance of adult female rats given oral doses of up to 100 mg / kg / day for 14 days prior to mating through Gestation Day 7 .
It reversibly decreased fertility and reproductive performance in adult male rats when given at doses ≥ 50 mg / kg / day , with exposures approximately equal to or greater than the expected human exposure level ( exposure comparisons are based on AUCs ) .
The reversible fertility effects were mediated through altered spermatogenesis .
Affected spermatids contained abnormally formed and oriented mitochondria and were non - viable .
Epithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia in the epididymis was observed in conjunction with decreased fertility .
Similar epididymal changes were not seen in dogs .
In sexually mature male rats exposed to drug as juveniles , mildly decreased fertility was observed following treatment with linezolid through most of their period of sexual development ( 50 mg / kg / day from days 7 to 36 of age , and 100 mg / kg / day from days 37 to 55 of age ) , with exposures up to 1 . 7 times greater than mean AUCs observed in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 11 years .
Decreased fertility was not observed with shorter treatment periods , corresponding to exposure in utero through the early neonatal period ( gestation day 6 through postnatal day 5 ) , neonatal exposure ( postnatal days 5 to 21 ) , or to juvenile exposure ( postnatal days 22 to 35 ) .
Reversible reductions in sperm motility and altered sperm morphology were observed in rats treated from postnatal day 22 to 35 .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Target organs of linezolid toxicity were similar in juvenile and adult rats and dogs .
Dose - and time - dependent myelosuppression , as evidenced by bone marrow hypocellularity / decreased hematopoiesis , decreased extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and liver , and decreased levels of circulating erythrocytes , leukocytes , and platelets have been seen in animal studies .
Lymphoid depletion occurred in thymus , lymph nodes , and spleen .
Generally , the lymphoid findings were associated with anorexia , weight loss , and suppression of body weight gain , which may have contributed to the observed effects .
In rats administered linezolid orally for 6 months , non - reversible , minimal to mild axonal degeneration of sciatic nerves was observed at 80 mg / kg / day ; minimal degeneration of the sciatic nerve was also observed in 1 male at this dose level at a 3 - month interim necropsy .
Sensitive morphologic evaluation of perfusion - fixed tissues was conducted to investigate evidence of optic nerve degeneration .
Minimal to moderate optic nerve degeneration was evident in 2 male rats after 6 months of dosing , but the direct relationship to drug was equivocal because of the acute nature of the finding and its asymmetrical distribution .
The nerve degeneration observed was microscopically comparable to spontaneous unilateral optic nerve degeneration reported in aging rats and may be an exacerbation of common background change .
These effects were observed at exposure levels that are comparable to those observed in some human subjects .
The hematopoietic and lymphoid effects were reversible , although in some studies , reversal was incomplete within the duration of the recovery period .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Adults Nosocomial Pneumonia Adult patients with clinically and radiologically documented nosocomial pneumonia were enrolled in a randomized , multi - center , double - blind trial .

This was a randomized , open - label trial in hospitalized adult patients with documented or suspected MRSA infection .
One group of patients received linezolid injection 600 mg every 12 hours followed by linezolid tablets 600 mg every 12 hours .
The other group of patients received vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours intravenously .
Both groups were treated for 7 to 28 days , and could receive concomitant aztreonam or gentamicin if clinically indicated .
The cure rates in microbiologically evaluable patients with MRSA skin and skin structure infection were 26 / 33 ( 79 % ) for linezolid - treated patients and 24 / 33 ( 73 % ) for vancomycin - treated patients .
Diabetic Foot Infections Adult diabetic patients with clinically documented complicated skin and skin structure infections ( “ diabetic foot infections ” ) were enrolled in a randomized ( 2 : 1 ratio ) , multi - center , open - label trial comparing study medications administered intravenously or orally for a total of 14 to 28 days of treatment .
One group of patients received linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours intravenously or orally ; the other group received ampicillin / sulbactam 1 . 5 to 3 g intravenously or amoxicillin / clavulanate 500 to 875 mg every 8 to 12 hours orally .
In countries where ampicillin / sulbactam is not marketed , amoxicillin / clavulanate 500 mg to 2 g every 6 hours was used for the intravenous regimen .
Patients in the comparator group could also be treated with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours intravenously if MRSA was isolated from the foot infection .
Patients in either treatment group who had Gram - negative bacilli isolated from the infection site could also receive aztreonam 1 to 2 g every 8 - 12 hours intravenously .
All patients were eligible to receive appropriate adjunctive treatment methods , such as debridement and off - loading , as typically required in the treatment of diabetic foot infections , and most patients received these treatments .
There were 241 linezolid - treated and 120 comparator - treated patients in the intent - to - treat ( ITT ) study population .
Two hundred twelve ( 86 % ) linezolid - treated patients and 105 ( 85 % ) comparator - treated patients were clinically evaluable .
In the ITT population , the cure rates were 68 . 5 % ( 165 / 241 ) in linezolid - treated patients and 64 % ( 77 / 120 ) in comparator - treated patients , where those with indeterminate and missing outcomes were considered failures .
The cure rates in the clinically evaluable patients ( excluding those with indeterminate and missing outcomes ) were 83 % ( 159 / 192 ) and 73 % ( 74 / 101 ) in the linezolid - and comparator - treated patients , respectively .
A critical post - hoc analysis focused on 121 linezolid - treated and 60 comparator - treated patients who had a Gram - positive pathogen isolated from the site of infection or from blood , who had less evidence of underlying osteomyelitis than the overall study population , and who did not receive prohibited antimicrobials .
Based upon that analysis , the cure rates were 71 % ( 86 / 121 ) in the linezolid - treated patients and 63 % ( 38 / 60 ) in the comparator - treated patients .
None of the above analyses were adjusted for the use of adjunctive therapies .
The cure rates by pathogen for microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 14 .

14 . 2 Pediatric Patients Infections due to Gram - positive Bacteria A safety and efficacy study provided experience on the use of linezolid in pediatric patients for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia , complicated skin and skin structure infections , and other infections due to Gram - positive bacterial pathogens , including methicillin - resistant and - susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin - resistant Enterococcus faecium .
Pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 11 years with infections caused by the documented or suspected Gram - positive bacteria were enrolled in a randomized , open - label , comparator - controlled trial .
One group of patients received linezolid injection 10 mg / kg every 8 hours followed by linezolid for oral suspension 10 mg / kg every 8 hours .
A second group received vancomycin 10 to 15 mg / kg intravenously every 6 to 24 hours , depending on age and renal clearance .
Patients who had confirmed VRE infections were placed in a third arm of the study and received linezolid 10 mg / kg every 8 hours intravenously and / or orally .
All patients were treated for a total of 10 to 28 days and could receive concomitant Gram - negative antibiotics if clinically indicated .
In the intent - to - treat ( ITT ) population , there were 206 patients randomized to linezolid and 102 patients randomized to vancomycin .
The cure rates for ITT , MITT , and clinically evaluable patients are presented in Table 16 .
After the study was completed , 13 additional patients ranging from 4 days through 16 years of age were enrolled in an open - label extension of the VRE arm of the study .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Important Administration Instructions Advise patients that linezolid may be taken with or without food .
Peripheral and Optic Neuropathy Advise patients to inform their physician if they experience changes in vision while taking linezolid [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Serotonin Syndrome Advise patients to inform their physician if taking serotonergic agents , including serotonin re - uptake inhibitors or other antidepressants and opioids [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ] .
Potential Interactions Producing Elevation of Blood Pressure • Advise patients to inform their physician if they have a history of hypertension .
• Advise patients to avoid large quantities of foods or beverages with high tyramine content while taking linezolid .
Foods high in tyramine content include those that may have undergone protein changes by aging , fermentation , pickling , or smoking to improve flavor , such as aged cheeses , fermented or air - dried meats , sauerkraut , soy sauce , tap beers , and red wines .
The tyramine content of any protein - rich food may be increased if stored for long periods or improperly refrigerated .
• Advise patients to inform their physician if taking medications containing pseudoephedrine HCl or phenylpropanolamine HCl , such as cold remedies and decongestants [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Lactic Acidosis Advise patients to inform their physician if they experience repeated episodes of nausea or vomiting while receiving linezolid [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Convulsions Advise patients to inform their physician if they have a history of seizures or convulsions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
Hypoglycemia Advise patients to inform their physician if they have diabetes mellitus .
Hypoglycemic reactions , such as diaphoresis and tremulousness , along with low blood glucose measurements may occur when treated with linezolid .
If such reactions occur , patients should contact a physician or other health professional for proper treatment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
Hyponatremia and / or SIADH Advise patients at risk for hyponatremia to inform their physician if they experience signs and symptoms of hyponatremia and / or SIADH , including confusion , somnolence , generalized weakness , and respiratory distress [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] .
Antibacterial Resistance Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including linezolid should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When linezolid is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by linezolid or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
Diarrhea Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs , which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued .
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs , patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug .
If this occurs , patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Infertility Advise male patients that linezolid may reversibly impair fertility [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
