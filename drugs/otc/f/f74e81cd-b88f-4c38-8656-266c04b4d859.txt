Across clinical trials in patients with NSCLC ( n = 1719 ) , 2 . 9 % of XALKORI - treated patients had ILD of any grade , 1 % had Grade 3 or 4 ILD , and 0 . 5 % had fatal ILD [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Interstitial lung disease generally occurred within 3 months after the initiation of XALKORI .
In Study ADVL0912 , among 121 patients ages 1 to ≤ 21 years with relapsed or refractory tumors , including ALCL and IMT , ILD occurred in 0 . 8 % of patients .
Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD / pneumonitis .
Exclude other potential causes of ILD / pneumonitis , and permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients diagnosed with drug - related ILD / pneumonitis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 3 QT Interval Prolongation QTc prolongation can occur in patients treated with XALKORI .
Across clinical trials in patients with NSCLC , 2 . 1 % of 1616 patients had QTcF ( corrected QT for heart rate by the Fridericia method ) greater than or equal to 500 ms and 5 % of 1582 patients had an increase from baseline QTcF greater than or equal to 60 ms by automated machine - read evaluation of ECGs .
In Study ADVL0912 , QTc prolongation was reported as an adverse reaction in 4 . 1 % of patients , including 8 % of patients with ALCL and 7 % of pediatric patients with IMT .
Avoid use of XALKORI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome .

Withhold , reduce dose , or permanently discontinue XALKORI for QT / QTc interval prolongation as recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 4 Bradycardia Symptomatic bradycardia can occur in patients receiving XALKORI .
Across clinical trials in patients with NSCLC , bradycardia occurred in 13 % of 1719 patients treated with XALKORI .
Grade 3 syncope occurred in 2 . 4 % of XALKORI - treated patients and in 0 . 6 % of the chemotherapy - treated patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In Study ADVL0912 , among 121 patients ages 1 to ≤ 21 years treated with XALKORI , bradycardia was reported in 14 % , including Grade 3 bradycardia in 0 . 8 % of patients .
Of the 26 patients with ALCL treated with XALKORI , bradycardia ( all Grade 1 ) was reported in 19 % .
Of the 14 pediatric patients with IMT treated with XALKORI , bradycardia was reported in 14 % of patients , including Grade 3 bradycardia in 7 % of patients .
Avoid using XALKORI in combination with other medications known to cause bradycardia ( e . g . , beta - blockers , nondihydropyridine - calcium channel blockers , clonidine , and digoxin ) to the extent possible .
Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly .
If bradycardia occurs , re - evaluate for the use of concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia .
Withhold , reduce dose , or permanently discontinue XALKORI for bradycardia as recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 5 Severe Visual Loss Across all clinical trials in patients with NSCLC , the incidence of Grade 4 visual field defect with visual loss was 0 . 2 % of 1719 patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Optic atrophy and optic nerve disorder have been reported as potential causes of visual loss .
In Study ADVL0912 , visual disorders occurred in 46 % of 121 patients with XALKORI , including 65 % of 26 patients with ALCL and 50 % of 14 patients with IMT .
Of the 56 patients who experienced visual disorders , one pediatric patient with IMT experienced Grade 3 myopic optic nerve disorder .
The most common visual symptoms were blurred vision and visual impairment .
Assessment of visual symptoms for all patients is recommended monthly during treatment .
Report new visual symptoms to an eye specialist .
For pediatric and young adult patients with ALCL or IMT , obtain baseline and follow - up ophthalmologic examinations including retinal examination within 1 month of starting XALKORI and every 3 months thereafter .
The ophthalmological evaluation should consist of best corrected visual acuity , retinal photographs , visual fields , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , and other evaluations as appropriate [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Permanently discontinue XALKORI for Grade 3 or 4 ocular disorders or severe visual loss ( best corrected vision less than 20 / 200 in one or both eyes ) unless another cause is identified [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
There is insufficient information to characterize the risks of resumption of XALKORI in patients who develop visual symptoms or visual loss .
A decision to resume XALKORI should consider the potential benefits versus risks to the patient .
5 . 6 Gastrointestinal Toxicity in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients with ALCL or Pediatric Patients with IMT XALKORI can cause severe gastrointestinal toxicities in pediatric and young adult patients with ALCL or pediatric patients with IMT [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In patients with ALCL ( n = 26 ) , gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 100 % of patients ; Grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 27 % of patients and included diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , and stomatitis .
In pediatric patients with IMT ( n = 14 ) , vomiting occurred in 93 % , nausea occurred in 86 % , and diarrhea occurred in 64 % of patients .
Provide standard antiemetic and antidiarrheal agents for gastrointestinal toxicities in pediatric and young adult patients with ALCL or pediatric patients with IMT .
Antiemetics are recommended prior to and during treatment with XALKORI to prevent nausea and vomiting .
If patients develop Grade 3 nausea lasting 3 days or Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or vomiting despite maximum medical therapy , withhold XALKORI until resolved , and then resume at the next lower dose level .
Consider supportive care such as hydration , electrolyte supplementation , and nutritional support as clinically indicated [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 7 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action , XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of crizotinib in pregnant rats during organogenesis at exposures similar to those observed with the maximum recommended human dose resulted in embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XALKORI and for at least 45 days following the final dose .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with XALKORI and for at least 90 days after the final dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .

Study A8081013 The safety of XALKORI for adult patients with ALK - positive IMT was evaluated in Study A8081013 [ s ee Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] that included 7 patients with IMT with a median age of 38 years ( range 23 to 73 ) .
The safety profile of this patient group was generally consistent with the safety profile of XALKORI evaluated in patients with ALK - positive or ROS1 - positive NSCLC .
The most frequent adverse reactions ( ≥ 20 % ) were vision disorders , nausea , and edema .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reaction has been identified during post - approval use of XALKORI .
Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Investigations : Increased blood creatine phosphokinase 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Avoid concomitant use .
( 2 . 7 , 7 . 1 ) • • Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant use .
( 7 . 1 ) • • CYP3A Substrates : Avoid concomitant use with CYP3A substrates , where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Other Drugs on XALKORI Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Concomitant use of crizotinib with strong CYP3A inhibitors increases crizotinib plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of XALKORI .
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors .
If concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors is unavoidable , reduce the XALKORI dosage [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] .
Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice which may also increase plasma concentrations of crizotinib .
Use caution with concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors .
Strong CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use of crizotinib with strong CYP3A inducers decreases crizotinib plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may decrease the efficacy of XALKORI .
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers .
7 . 2 Effect of XALKORI on Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates Concomitant use of crizotinib increases plasma concentrations of CYP3A substrates [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of these substrates .
Avoid concomitant use of XALKORI with CYP3A substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions .
If concomitant use of XALKORI is unavoidable , decrease the CYP3A substrate dosage in accordance with approved product labeling .
7 . 3 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval XALKORI can prolong the QT / QTc interval .
Avoid concomitant use of XALKORI with drugs that prolong the QT interval [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
7 . 4 Drugs That Cause Bradycardia XALKORI can cause bradycardia .
Avoid concomitant use of XALKORI with drugs that cause bradycardia ( e . g . , beta - blockers , non - dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers , clonidine , and digoxin ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action , XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on the use of XALKORI during pregnancy .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of crizotinib in pregnant rats during organogenesis at exposures similar to those expected with the maximum recommended human dose resulted in embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Crizotinib was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis to study the effects on embryo - fetal development .
Postimplantation loss was increased at doses ≥ 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 6 times the recommended human dose based on AUC ) in rats .
No teratogenic effects were observed in rats at doses up to the maternally toxic dose of 200 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 . 7 times the recommended human dose based on AUC ) or in rabbits at doses of up to 60 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1 . 6 times the recommended human dose based on AUC ) , though fetal body weights were reduced at these doses .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of crizotinib or its metabolites in human milk , or the effects on the breastfed child or on milk production .
Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed children , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with XALKORI and for 45 days after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating XALKORI [ see Use in Specific Population ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XALKORI and for at least 45 days after the final dose .
Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with XALKORI and for at least 90 days after the final dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Based on reproductive organ findings in animals , XALKORI may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential .
It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of XALKORI have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with relapsed or refractory , systemic ALK - positive ALCL or with unresectable , recurrent , or refractory ALK - positive IMT [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 , 14 . 3 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age with ALCL or with IMT , or in any pediatric patients with NSCLC .
In a study that evaluated XALKORI in combination with chemotherapy in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed ALCL ( Study ANHL12P1 ; NCT01979536 ) , 13 of 66 ( 20 % ) patients had a Grade 2 or higher thromboembolic event , including pulmonary embolism in 6 % .
The safety and effectiveness of XALKORI in combination with chemotherapy have not been established in patients with newly diagnosed ALCL .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Decreased bone formation in growing long bones was observed in immature rats at 150 mg / kg / day following once daily dosing for 28 days ( approximately 5 . 4 times the recommended human dose based on AUC ) .
Other toxicities of potential concern to pediatric patients have not been evaluated in juvenile animals .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients with ALK - positive metastatic NSCLC in clinical studies of XALKORI ( n = 1669 ) , 16 % were 65 years or older and 3 . 8 % were 75 years or older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
Clinical studies of XALKORI in patients with ROS1 - positive metastatic NSCLC did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Crizotinib concentrations increased in patients with pre - existing moderate ( any AST and total bilirubin greater than 1 . 5 times ULN and less than or equal to 3 times ULN ) or severe ( any AST and total bilirubin greater than 3 times ULN ) hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Reduce XALKORI dosage in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with pre - existing mild hepatic impairment ( AST > ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1 times ULN or any AST and total bilirubin greater than 1 times ULN but less than or equal to1 . 5 times ULN ) .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment Increased exposure to crizotinib occurred in patients with pre - existing severe renal impairment ( CLcr less than 30 mL / min calculated using the modified Cockcroft - Gault equation for adult patients and the Schwartz equation for pediatric patients ) not requiring dialysis , therefore reduce dosage of XALKORI in these patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 to 89 mL / min ) .
11 DESCRIPTION Crizotinib is a kinase inhibitor .
The molecular formula for crizotinib is C21H22Cl2FN5O and the molecular weight is 450 . 34 daltons .
Crizotinib is described chemically as ( R ) - 3 - [ 1 - ( 2 , 6 - Dichloro - 3 - fluorophenyl ) ethoxy ] - 5 - [ 1 - ( piperidin - 4 - yl ) - 1 H - pyrazol - 4 - yl ] pyridin - 2 - amine .
The chemical structure of crizotinib is shown below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Crizotinib is a white to pale - yellow powder with a pKa of 9 . 4 ( piperidinium cation ) and 5 . 6 ( pyridinium cation ) .
The solubility of crizotinib in aqueous media decreases over the range pH 1 . 6 to pH 8 . 2 from greater than 10 mg / mL to less than 0 . 1 mg / mL .
The log of the distribution coefficient ( octanol / water ) at pH 7 . 4 is 1 . 65 .
XALKORI ( crizotinib ) for oral administration is supplied as printed hard - shell capsules containing 250 mg or 200 mg of crizotinib together with colloidal silicon dioxide , microcrystalline cellulose , anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate , sodium starch glycolate , magnesium stearate , and hard gelatin capsule shells as inactive ingredients .
The pink opaque capsule shell components contain gelatin , titanium dioxide , and red iron oxide .
The white opaque capsule shell components contain gelatin and titanium dioxide .
The printing ink contains shellac , propylene glycol , strong ammonia solution , potassium hydroxide , and black iron oxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Crizotinib is an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases including ALK , Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor ( HGFR , c - Met ) , ROS1 ( c - ros ) , and Recepteur d ' Origine Nantais ( RON ) .
Translocations can affect the ALK gene resulting in the expression of oncogenic fusion proteins .
The formation of ALK fusion proteins results in activation and dysregulation of the gene ' s expression and signaling which can contribute to increased cell proliferation and survival in tumors expressing these proteins .
Crizotinib demonstrated concentration - dependent inhibition of ALK , ROS1 , and c - Met phosphorylation in cell - based assays using tumor cell lines and demonstrated antitumor activity in mice bearing tumor xenografts that expressed echinoderm microtubule - associated protein - like 4 ( EML4 ) - or nucleophosmin ( NPM ) - ALK fusion proteins or c - Met .
In vitro , crizotinib induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation and ALK - mediated signaling in ALCL - derived cell lines ( containing NPM - ALK ) at clinically achievable exposures .
In vivo data obtained in an ALCL - derived mouse model showed complete regression of the tumor at a dose of 100 mg / kg once daily .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In an ECG substudy conducted in 52 patients with ALK - positive NSCLC , the maximum mean QTcF ( corrected QT by the Fridericia method ) change from baseline was 12 . 3 ms ( 2 - sided 90 % upper CI : 19 . 5 ms ) following administration of XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily .
An exposure - QT analysis suggested a crizotinib plasma concentration - dependent increase in QTcF [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following XALKORI 250 mg twice daily , steady - state was reached within 15 days and remained stable , with a median accumulation ratio of 4 . 8 .
Steady - state observed minimum concentration ( Cmin ) and AUC increased in a greater than dose - proportional manner over the dose range of 200 mg to 300 mg twice daily ( 0 . 8 to 1 . 2 times the approved recommended dosage ) .
Absorption A single crizotinib dose was absorbed with median time to achieve peak concentration of 4 to 6 hours , and the mean absolute bioavailability of crizotinib was 43 % ( range : 32 % to 66 % ) .
Effect of Food A high - fat meal reduced crizotinib AUC0 – INF and maximum observed plasma concentration ( Cmax ) by approximately 14 % .
Distribution The geometric mean volume of distribution ( Vss ) of crizotinib was 1772 L following a single intravenous dose .
Protein binding of crizotinib is 91 % and is independent of drug concentration in vitro .
Crizotinib is a substrate for P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) in vitro .
The blood - to - plasma concentration ratio is approximately 1 .
Elimination The mean apparent plasma terminal half - life of crizotinib was 42 hours following single doses of crizotinib in patients .
The mean apparent clearance ( CL / F ) of crizotinib was lower at steady - state ( 60 L / h ) after 250 mg twice daily than after a single 250 mg oral dose ( 100 L / h ) .
Metabolism Crizotinib is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A .
Excretion Following administration of a single oral 250 mg dose of radiolabeled crizotinib dose to healthy subjects , 63 % ( 53 % as unchanged ) of the administered dose was recovered in feces and 22 % ( 2 . 3 % as unchanged ) in urine .
Specific Populations No clinically significant difference in crizotinib pharmacokinetics were observed based on age , sex , or ethnicity ( Asian , non - Asian ) .
For patients < 18 years of age , body weight has a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of crizotinib , with lower crizotinib exposures observed in patients with higher body weight .
Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients , crizotinib steady - state exposure increased proportionally with dose over the dose range of 165 mg / m2 to 280 mg / m2 orally twice daily .
At a dosing regimen of 280 mg / m2 ( approximately 2 times the recommended adult dose ) , geometric mean ( CV % ) steady - state maximum plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) of crizotinib was 621 ( 73 % ) ng / mL and AUC0 – tau was 6530 ( 34 % ) ng ∙ hr / mL .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Steady - state mean crizotinib AUC and Cmax decreased by 9 % in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( AST > ULN and total bilirubin ≤ 1 times ULN or any AST and total bilirubin > 1 times ULN but ≤ 1 . 5 times ULN ) compared to patients with normal hepatic function following XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily .
Steady - state mean crizotinib AUC increased by 14 % and Cmax increased by 9 % in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( any AST and total bilirubin > 1 . 5 times ULN and ≤ 3 times ULN ) following XALKORI 200 mg orally twice daily compared with patients with normal hepatic function following XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily .
Mean crizotinib AUC decreased by 35 % and Cmax decreased by 27 % in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( any AST and total bilirubin > 3 times ULN ) following XALKORI 250 mg orally once daily compared with patients with normal hepatic function following XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with Renal Impairment Mild or moderate renal impairment ( CLcr of 60 – 89 ml / min or 30 – 59 ml / min , respectively , calculated using the modified Cockcroft - Gault equation ) has no clinically significant effect on the exposure of crizotinib .
Following a single 250 mg dose , the mean AUC0 – INF of crizotinib increased by 79 % and the mean Cmax increased by 34 % in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) who did not require dialysis compared to those with normal renal function ( CLcr ≥ 90 mL / min ) .
Similar changes in AUC0 – INF and Cmax were observed for the active metabolite of crizotinib [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Gastric Acid Reducing Agents : No clinically significant differences in crizotinib pharmacokinetics were observed when used concomitantly with esomeprazole , a proton pump inhibitor .
Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Coadministration of a single 150 mg oral dose of crizotinib with ketoconazole , a strong CYP3A inhibitor , increased crizotinib AUC0 – INF by 216 % and Cmax by 44 % compared to crizotinib alone .
Coadministration of XALKORI 250 mg orally once daily with itraconazole , a strong CYP3A inhibitor , increased crizotinib steady - state AUC by 57 % and Cmax by 33 % compared to crizotinib alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Strong CYP3A Inducers : Coadministration of XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily with rifampin , a strong CYP3A inducer , decreased crizotinib steady - state AUC0 – Tau by 84 % and Cmax by 79 % , compared to crizotinib alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
CYP3A Substrates : Coadministration of XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily for 28 days increased AUC0 – INF of oral midazolam ( CYP3A substrate ) 3 . 7 - fold compared to midazolam alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes : Crizotinib inhibits CYP2B6 in vitro .
Crizotinib does not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP2D6 .
Crizotinib does not induce CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP3A .
UDP - glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT ) : Crizotinib does not inhibit UGT1A1 , UGT1A4 , UGT1A6 , UGT1A9 or UGT2B7 .
Transporters : Crizotinib inhibits P - gp , organic cation transporter ( OCT ) 1 , and OCT2 .
Crizotinib does not inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptides ( OATP ) B1 , OATP1B3 , organic anion transporter ( OAT ) 1 , OAT3 , or bile salt export pump transporter ( BSEP ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with crizotinib have not been conducted .
Crizotinib was genotoxic in an in vitro micronucleus assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cultures , in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay , and in in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assays .
Crizotinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay .
No specific studies with crizotinib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility ; however , crizotinib is considered to have the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility in humans based on findings in repeat - dose toxicity studies in the rat .
Findings observed in the male reproductive tract included testicular pachytene spermatocyte degeneration in rats given greater than or equal to 50 mg / kg / day for 28 days ( greater than 1 . 7 times the recommended human dose based on AUC ) .
Findings observed in the female reproductive tract included single - cell necrosis of ovarian follicles of a rat given 500 mg / kg / day ( approximately 10 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) for 3 days .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 ALK - or ROS1 - Positive Metastatic Non - Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Untreated ALK - Positive Metastatic NSCLC - Study 1 ( PROFILE 1014 ; NCT01154140 ) The efficacy of XALKORI for the treatment of patients with ALK - positive metastatic NSCLC , who had not received previous systemic treatment for advanced disease , was demonstrated in a randomized , multicenter , open - label , active - controlled study ( Study 1 ) .
Patients were required to have ALK - positive NSCLC as identified by the FDA - approved assay , Vysis ALK Break - Apart fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) Probe Kit , prior to randomization .
The major efficacy outcome measure was progression - free survival ( PFS ) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1 . 1 as assessed by independent radiology review ( IRR ) committee .
Additional efficacy outcome measures included objective response rate ( ORR ) as assessed by IRR , DOR , and overall survival ( OS ) .
Patient - reported lung cancer symptoms were assessed at baseline and periodically during treatment .
Patients were randomized to receive XALKORI ( n = 172 ) or chemotherapy ( n = 171 ) .
Randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( 0 – 1 , 2 ) , race ( Asian , non - Asian ) , and brain metastases ( present , absent ) .
Patients in the XALKORI arm received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily until documented disease progression , intolerance to therapy , or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit .
Chemotherapy consisted of pemetrexed 500 mg / m2 with cisplatin 75 mg / m2 or carboplatin AUC of 5 or 6 mg × min / mL by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles .
Patients in the chemotherapy arm were not permitted to receive maintenance chemotherapy .
At the time of documented disease progression , as per independent radiology review , patients randomized to chemotherapy were offered XALKORI .
The demographic characteristics of the overall study population were 62 % female , median age of 53 years , baseline ECOG performance status 0 or 1 ( 95 % ) , 51 % White and 46 % Asian , 4 % current smokers , 32 % past smokers , and 64 % never smokers .
The disease characteristics of the overall study population were metastatic disease in 98 % of patients , 92 % of patients ' tumors were classified as adenocarcinoma histology , 27 % of patients had brain metastases , and 7 % received systemic chemotherapy as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy .
At the time of the final analysis of overall survival , 84 % of patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm subsequently received XALKORI .
Study 1 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in patients treated with XALKORI .
There was no statistically significant difference in OS between patients treated with XALKORI and patients treated with chemotherapy .
Table 15 and Figure 1 summarize the efficacy results .
Exploratory patient - reported symptom measures of baseline and post - treatment dyspnea , cough , and chest pain suggested a delay in time to development of or worsening of dyspnea , but not cough or chest pain , in patients treated with XALKORI as compared to chemotherapy .
The patient - reported delay in onset or worsening of dyspnea may be an overestimation , because patients were not blinded to treatment assignment .
