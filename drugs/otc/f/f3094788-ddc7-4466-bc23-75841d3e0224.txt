Remove tubing from collection bag .
2 . 19 .
The blood filtration is executed according to the following operation .
( see Fig . 3 and Fig . 4 ) 2 . 19 . 1 .
NOTE : Wait 1 hour after collection before filtering .

Make an appropriate number of segments of anticoagulated blood for testing by sealing on or near the X marks .
Leave segments attached to the filtered whole blood unit .
2 . 29 .
The time between Whole Blood collection and component separation may vary depending on both the blood bag system and processing options selected .
2 . 29 . 1 .
NOTE : Platelets should be separated from the Red Blood Cells within 8 hours of blood collection .
2 . 29 . 2 .
NOTE : Fresh Frozen Plasma should be separated from the Red Blood Cells and placed in a freezer at – 18ºC or colder within 8 hours of collection .
2 . 29 . 3 .

PROCEDURE FOR USE OF DonorCare ® Needle Guard This device is for use by trained individuals .
Intended Use The DonorCare ® Needle Guard is incorporated onto the donor tubing to shield the needle immediately after withdrawal from the donor .
Single Use Only .
Preparation 1 .
Move the DonorCare on the tubing ensuring that it slides easily and the arrow is pointing toward the needle hub .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 .
Ensure that the three lock points on the DonorCare are locked closed .
Whole Blood Collection 3 .
Perform the phlebotomy as per your institution ' s standard operating procedures .
4 .
Slide the DonorCare over the needle hub so that it covers approximately one half to two thirds of the needle hub .
5 .
Stabilize the DonorCare to the arm by placing a piece of tape over the front end so that the tape does not extend over the front of the DonorCare .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Withdrawal of Needle Important The DonorCare must be held stationary while the needle is withdrawn into it .
Caution The needle must be fully shielded by DonorCare to prevent accidental injury .
6 .
Hold gauze over the venipuncture site with finger tips without exerting pressure .
Hold the sides of the DonorCare near the front with the index finger and thumb of the same hand .
7 .
With the other hand , hold the donor tubing close behind the DonorCare .
Note : A hemostat may be placed on the tubing behind the DonorCare when the blood collection is complete .
This will help to prevent blood drops from forming .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 8 .
Pull tubing smoothly and swiftly with one motion until the needle is locked in place inside the DonorCare .
9 .
Confirm that the needle is locked by : a . Listening for two ' clicks ' as the needle is drawn into DonorCare .
b .
If the clicks are not heard as the needle is drawn into the DonorCare , continue to pull firmly on the tubing to assure needle is fully withdrawn into DonorCare .
10 .
Visually check that the needle is fully shielded by DonorCare before removing from the donor ' s arm .
11 .
Remove the tape from the DonorCare and arm .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 .
Apply pressure to the gauze covering the venipuncture site .
Warning Do not place fingers at the opening of DonorCare after removal from the donor ' s arm .
Difficult Phlebotomy ( Examples may include : Slow blood flow , deep or fine vein , steep angle ) It may be necessary to delay placing the DonorCare over the needle hub until the end of the blood collection .
In such situations : Leave the DonorCare on the tubing behind the needle hub .
At the end of the blood collection carefully remove the tape from the needle hub and slide the DonorCare over the hub so that it covers approximately one half to two thirds of the needle hub .
Withdraw the needle into the DonorCare as stated in steps 6 .
through 12 .
above .
