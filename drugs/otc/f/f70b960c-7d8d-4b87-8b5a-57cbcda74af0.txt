Oral LD50 ' s ( mg / kg ) : mice , 1000 ; rats , 1250 .
Signs and Symptoms Overdosage with Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection , USP is characterized chiefly by cardiovascular disturbances , such as arrhythmias , tachycardia , hypotension , and possibly shock .
In addition , the following might occur : excitation , headache , sweating , pupillary contraction , visual disturbances ; nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ; hypoglycemia .
Treatment There is no specific antidote .
A decrease in blood pressure to dangerous levels or other evidence of shock like conditions should be treated vigorously and promptly .
The patient ' s legs should be kept raised and a plasma expander should be administered .
If necessary , intravenous infusion of norepinephrine , titrated to maintain blood pressure at the normotensive level , and all available supportive measures should be included .
Epinephrine should not be used , since it may cause a paradoxical reduction in blood pressure .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The reconstituted solution should be used upon preparation and should not be stored .
Note : Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
1 .
Prevention or control of hypertensive episodes in the patient with pheochromocytoma For preoperative reduction of elevated blood pressure , 5 mg of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection , USP ( 1 mg for children ) is injected intravenously or intramuscularly 1 or 2 hours before surgery , and repeated if necessary .
During surgery , Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection , USP ( 5 mg for adults , 1 mg for children ) is administered intravenously as indicated , to help prevent or control paroxysms of hypertension , tachycardia , respiratory depression , convulsions , or other effects of epinephrine intoxication .
( Postoperatively , norepinephrine may be given to control the hypotension that commonly follows complete removal of a pheochromocytoma . )
2 .
Prevention or treatment of dermal necrosis and sloughing following intravenous administration or extravasation of norepinephrine For Prevention : 10 mg of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection , USP is added to each liter of solution containing norepinephrine .
The pressor effect of norepinephrine is not affected .
For Treatment : 5 - 10 mg of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection , USP in 10 mL of saline is injected into the area of extravasation within 12 hours .
3 .
Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma — Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection , USP blocking test The test is most reliable in detecting pheochromocytoma in patients with sustained hypertension and least reliable in those with paroxysmal hypertension .
False - positive tests may occur in patients with hypertension without pheochromocytoma .
a . Intravenous Preparation The CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS sections should be reviewed .
Sedatives , analgesics , and all other medications except those that might be deemed essential ( such as digitalis and insulin ) are withheld for at least 24 hours , and preferably 48 - 72 hours , prior to the test .
Antihypertensive drugs are withheld until blood pressure returns to the untreated , hypertensive level .
This test is not performed on a patient who is normotensive .
Procedure The patient is kept at rest in the supine position throughout the test , preferably in a quiet , darkened room .
Injection of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection , USP is delayed until blood pressure is stabilized , as evidenced by blood pressure readings taken every 10 minutes for at least 30 minutes .
Five milligrams of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection , USP is dissolved in 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection .
The dose for adults is 5 mg ; for children , 1 mg .
The syringe needle is inserted into the vein , and injection is delayed until pressor response to venipuncture has subsided .
Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection , USP is injected rapidly .
Blood pressure is recorded immediately after injection , at 30 - second intervals for the first 3 minutes , and at 60 - second intervals for the next 7 minutes .
Interpretation A positive response , suggestive of pheochromocytoma , is indicated when the blood pressure is reduced more than 35 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic .
A typical positive response is a reduction in pressure of 60 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic .
Usually , maximal effect is evident within 2 minutes after injection .
A return to preinjection pressure commonly occurs within 15 - 30 minutes but may occur more rapidly .
If blood pressure decreases to a dangerous level , the patient should be treated as outlined under OVERDOSAGE .
A positive response should always be confirmed by other diagnostic procedures , preferably by measurement of urinary catecholamines or their metabolites .
A negative response is indicated when the blood pressure is elevated , unchanged , or reduced less than 35 mmHg , systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic after injection of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection , USP .
A negative response to this test does not exclude the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma , especially in patients with paroxysmal hypertension in whom the incidence of false - negative responses is high .
b . Intramuscular If the intramuscular test for pheochromocytoma is preferred , preparation is the same as for the intravenous test .
Five milligrams of Phentolamine Mesylate for Injection , USP is then dissolved in 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection .
The dose for adults is 5 mg intramuscularly ; for children , 3 mg .
Blood pressure is recorded every 5 minutes for 30 - 45 minutes following injection .
A positive response is indicated when the blood pressure is reduced 35 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic , or more , within 20 minutes following injection .
