7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug - drug interaction studies have been performed with Amitiza .
in vivo Based upon the results of human microsome studies , there is low likelihood of pharmacokinetic drug - drug interactions .
studies using human liver microsomes indicate that cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the metabolism of lubiprostone .
Further studies indicate microsomal carbonyl reductase may be involved in the extensive biotransformation of lubiprostone to the metabolite M3 [ see ] .
Additionally , studies in human liver microsomes demonstrate that lubiprostone does not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoforms 3A4 , 2D6 , 1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , or 2E1 , and studies of primary cultures of human hepatocytes show no induction of cytochrome P450 isoforms 1A2 , 2B6 , 2C9 , and 3A4 by lubiprostone .
Based on the available information , no protein binding – mediated drug interactions of clinical significance are anticipated .
in vitroIn vitroin vitroClinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) in vitroin vitro Interaction potential with diphenylheptane opioids ( e . g . methadone ) : Non - clinical studies have shown opioids of the diphenylheptane chemical class ( e . g . , methadone ) to dose - dependently reduce the activation of ClC - 2 by lubiprostone in the gastrointestinal tract .
There is a possibility of a dose - dependent decrease in the efficacy of Amitiza in patients using diphenylheptane opioids .
• Concomitant use of diphenylheptane opioids ( e . g . , methadone ) may interfere with the efficacy of Amitiza ( ) • 7 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm • ( 8 . 1 ) • Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when administering to a nursing woman • ( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C . Risk Summary There are no adequate and well - controlled studies with Amitiza in pregnant women .
A dose dependent increase in fetal loss was observed in pregnant guinea pigs that received lubiprostone doses equivalent to 0 . 2 to 6 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) based on body surface area ( mg / m ) .
Animal studies did not show an increase in structural malformations .
Amitiza should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
2 Clinical Considerations Current available data suggest that miscarriage occurs in 15 - 18 % of clinically recognized pregnancies , regardless of any drug exposure .
Consider the risks and benefits of available therapies when treating a pregnant woman for chronic idiopathic constipation , opioid - induced constipation or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation .
Animal Data In developmental toxicity studies , pregnant rats and rabbits received oral lubiprostone during organogenesis at doses up to approximately 338 times ( rats ) and approximately 34 times ( rabbits ) the maximum recommended human dose ( MHRD ) based on body surface area ( mg / m ) .
Maximal animal doses were 2000 mcg / kg / day ( rats ) and 100 mcg / kg / day ( rabbits ) .
In rats , there were increased incidences of early resorptions and soft tissue malformations ( cleft palate ) at the 2000 mcg / kg / day dose ; however , these effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity .
A dose - dependent increase in fetal loss occurred when guinea pigs received lubiprostone after the period of organogenesis , on days 40 to 53 of gestation , at daily oral doses of 1 , 10 , and 25 mcg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 2 , 2 and 6 times the MRHD based on body surface area ( mg / m ) ) .
The potential of lubiprostone to cause fetal loss was also examined in pregnant Rhesus monkeys .
Monkeys received lubiprostone post - organogenesis on gestation days 110 through 130 at daily oral doses of 10 and 30 mcg / kg / day ( approximately 3 and 10 times the MHRD based on body surface area ( mg / m ) ) .
Fetal loss was noted in one monkey from the 10 - mcg / kg dose group , which is within normal historical rates for this species .
There was no drug - related adverse effect seen in monkeys .
2 situsinversus , 22 8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether lubiprostone is excreted in human milk .
In rats , neither lubiprostone nor its active metabolites were detectable in breast milk following oral administration of lubiprostone .
Because lubiprostone increases fluid secretion in the intestine and intestinal motility , human milk - fed infants should be monitored for diarrhea .
Caution should be exercised when Amitiza is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Chronic Idiopathic Constipation The efficacy of Amitiza in the elderly ( ≥ 65 years of age ) subpopulation was consistent with the efficacy in the overall study population .
Of the total number of constipated patients treated in the dose - finding , efficacy , and long - term studies of Amitiza , 15 . 5 % were ≥ 65 years of age , and 4 . 2 % were ≥ 75 years of age .
Elderly patients taking Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily experienced a lower rate of associated nausea compared to the overall study population taking Amitiza ( 19 % vs . 29 % , respectively ) .
Opioid - induced Constipation The safety profile of Amitiza in the elderly ( ≥ 65 years of age ) subpopulation ( 8 . 8 % were ≥ 65 years of age and 1 . 6 % were ≥ 75 years of age ) was consistent with the safety profile in the overall study population .
Clinical studies of Amitiza did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation The safety profile of Amitiza in the elderly ( ≥ 65 years of age ) subpopulation ( 8 . 0 % were ≥ 65 years of age and 1 . 8 % were ≥ 75 years of age ) was consistent with the safety profile in the overall study population .
Clinical studies of Amitiza did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment [ see ] .
Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 12 . 3 8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B ) and severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) experienced markedly higher systemic exposure of lubiprostone active metabolite M3 , when compared to normal subjects [ see ] .
Clinical safety results demonstrated an increased incidence and severity of adverse events in subjects with greater severity of hepatic impairment .
Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 12 . 3 In case of chronic idiopathic constipation or opioid - induced constipation indications , the starting dosage of Amitiza should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment .
The starting dose of Amitiza should be reduced in all patients with severe hepatic impairment , regardless of the indication [ see ] .
No dosing adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A ) .
Dosage and Administration ( , ) 2 . 12 . 2 10 OVERDOSAGE There have been two confirmed reports of overdosage with Amitiza .
The first report involved a 3 - year - old child who accidentally ingested 7 or 8 capsules of 24 mcg of Amitiza and fully recovered .
The second report was a study patient who self - administered a total of 96 mcg of Amitiza per day for 8 days .
The patient experienced no adverse reactions during this time .
Additionally , in a Phase 1 cardiac repolarization study , 38 of 51 healthy volunteers given a single oral dose of 144 mcg of Amitiza ( 6 times the highest recommended dose ) experienced an adverse event that was at least possibly related to the study drug .
Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1 % of these volunteers included the following : nausea ( 45 % ) , diarrhea ( 35 % ) , vomiting ( 27 % ) , dizziness ( 14 % ) , headache ( 12 % ) , abdominal pain ( 8 % ) , flushing / hot flash ( 8 % ) , retching ( 8 % ) , dyspnea ( 4 % ) , pallor ( 4 % ) , stomach discomfort ( 4 % ) , anorexia ( 2 % ) , asthenia ( 2 % ) , chest discomfort ( 2 % ) , dry mouth ( 2 % ) , hyperhidrosis ( 2 % ) , and syncope ( 2 % ) .
11 DESCRIPTION Amitiza ( lubiprostone ) is a chloride channel activator for oral use .
The chemical name for lubiprostone is ( – ) - 7 - [ ( 2 , 4 a , 5 , 7 a ) - 2 - ( 1 , 1 - difluoropentyl ) - 2 - hydroxy - 6 - oxooctahydrocyclopenta [ ] pyran - 5 - yl ] heptanoic acid .
The molecular formula of lubiprostone is C H F O with a molecular weight of 390 . 46 and a chemical structure as follows : RRRRb203225 [ MULTIMEDIA ] Lubiprostone drug substance occurs as white , odorless crystals or crystalline powder , is very soluble in ether and ethanol , and is practically insoluble in hexane and water .
Amitiza is available as an imprinted , oval , soft gelatin capsule in two strengths .
Pink capsules contain 8 mcg of lubiprostone and the following inactive ingredients : medium - chain triglycerides , gelatin , sorbitol , ferric oxide , titanium dioxide , and purified water .
Orange capsules contain 24 mcg of lubiprostone and the following inactive ingredients : medium - chain triglycerides , gelatin , sorbitol , FD & C Red # 40 , D & C Yellow # 10 , and purified water .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Lubiprostone is a locally acting chloride channel activator that enhances a chloride - rich intestinal fluid secretion without altering sodium and potassium concentrations in the serum .
Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC - 2 , which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine , in a protein kinase A – independent fashion .
By increasing intestinal fluid secretion , lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine , thereby facilitating the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation .
Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical ( luminal ) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium .
Lubiprostone , via activation of apical ClC - 2 channels in intestinal epithelial cells , bypasses the antisecretory action of opiates that results from suppression of secretomotor neuron excitability .
Activation of ClC - 2 by lubiprostone has also been shown to stimulate recovery of mucosal barrier function and reduce intestinal permeability via the restoration of tight junction protein complexes in studies of ischemic porcine intestine .
ex vivo 12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Although the pharmacologic effects of lubiprostone in humans have not been fully evaluated , animal studies have shown that oral administration of lubiprostone increases chloride ion transport into the intestinal lumen , enhances fluid secretion into the bowels , and improves fecal transit .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Lubiprostone has low systemic availability following oral administration and concentrations of lubiprostone in plasma are below the level of quantitation ( 10 pg / mL ) .
Therefore , standard pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve ( AUC ) , maximum concentration ( C ) , and half - life ( t ) cannot be reliably calculated .
However , the pharmacokinetic parameters of M3 ( only measurable active metabolite of lubiprostone ) have been characterized .
Gender has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of M3 following the oral administration of lubiprostone .
max ½ Absorption Concentrations of lubiprostone in plasma are below the level of quantitation ( 10 pg / mL ) because lubiprostone has a low systemic availability following oral administration .
Peak plasma levels of M3 , after a single oral dose with 24 mcg of lubiprostone , occurred at approximately 1 . 10 hours .
The C was 41 . 5 pg / mL and the mean AUC was 57 . 1 pg ∙ hr / mL .
The AUC of M3 increases dose proportionally after single 24 - mcg and 144 - mcg doses of lubiprostone .
max0 – t0 – t Distribution protein binding studies indicate lubiprostone is approximately 94 % bound to human plasma proteins .
Studies in rats given radiolabeled lubiprostone indicate minimal distribution beyond the gastrointestinal tissues .
Concentrations of radiolabeled lubiprostone at 48 hours post - administration were minimal in all tissues of the rats .
In vitro Metabolism The results of both human and animal studies indicate that lubiprostone is rapidly and extensively metabolized by 15 - position reduction , α - chain β - oxidation , and ω - chain ω - oxidation .
These biotransformations are not mediated by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system but rather appear to be mediated by the ubiquitously expressed carbonyl reductase .
M3 , a metabolite of lubiprostone found in both humans and animals , is formed by the reduction of the carbonyl group at the 15 - hydroxy moiety that consists of both α - hydroxy and β - hydroxy epimers .
M3 makes up less than 10 % of the dose of radiolabeled lubiprostone .
Animal studies have shown that metabolism of lubiprostone rapidly occurs within the stomach and jejunum , most likely in the absence of any systemic absorption .
Elimination Lubiprostone could not be detected in plasma ; however , M3 has a t ranging from 0 . 9 to 1 . 4 hours .
After a single oral dose of 72 mcg of H - labeled lubiprostone , 60 % of total administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine within 24 hours and 30 % of total administered radioactivity was recovered in the feces by 168 hours .
Lubiprostone and M3 are only detected in trace amounts in human feces .
½ 3 Food Effect A study was conducted with a single 72 - mcg dose of H - labeled lubiprostone to evaluate the potential of a food effect on lubiprostone absorption , metabolism , and excretion .
Pharmacokinetic parameters of total radioactivity demonstrated that C decreased by 55 % while AUC was unchanged when lubiprostone was administered with a high - fat meal .
The clinical relevance of the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of lubiprostone is not clear .
However , lubiprostone was administered with food and water in a majority of clinical trials .
3max0 –∞ Special Populations Renal Impairment Sixteen subjects , 34 – 47 years old ( 8 severe renally impaired subjects [ creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) < 20 mL / min ] who required hemodialysis and 8 control subjects with normal renal function [ CrCl > 80 mL / min ] ) , received a single oral 24 - mcg dose of Amitiza .
Following administration , lubiprostone plasma concentrations were below the limit of quantitation ( 10 pg / mL ) .
Plasma concentrations of M3 were within the range of exposure from previous clinical experience with Amitiza .
Hepatic Impairment Twenty - five subjects , 38 – 78 years old ( 9 with severe hepatic impairment [ Child - Pugh Class C ] , 8 with moderate impairment [ Child - Pugh Class B ] , and 8 with normal liver function ) , received either 12 mcg or 24 mcg of Amitiza under fasting conditions .
Following administration , lubiprostone plasma concentrations were below the limit of quantitation ( 10 pg / mL ) except for two subjects .
In moderately and severely impaired subjects , the C and AUC of the active lubiprostone metabolite M3 were increased , as shown in Table 4 .

In the 2 - year carcinogenicity study in mice , lubiprostone doses of 25 , 75 , 200 , and 500 mcg / kg / day ( approximately 2 , 6 , 17 , and 42 times the highest recommended human dose , respectively , based on body surface area ) were used .
In the 2 - year rat carcinogenicity study , lubiprostone doses of 20 , 100 , and 400 mcg / kg / day ( approximately 3 , 17 , and 68 times the highest recommended human dose , respectively , based on body surface area ) were used .
In the mouse carcinogenicity study , there was no significant increase in any tumor incidences .
There was a significant increase in the incidence of interstitial cell adenoma of the testes in male rats at the 400 mcg / kg / day dose .
In female rats , treatment with lubiprostone produced hepatocellular adenoma at the 400 mcg / kg / day dose .
Mutagenesis Lubiprostone was not genotoxic in the Ames reverse mutation assay , the mouse lymphoma ( L5178Y TK ) forward mutation assay , the Chinese hamster lung ( CHL / IU ) chromosomal aberration assay , and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
in vitroin vitro + / – in vitroin vivo Impairment of Fertility Lubiprostone , at oral doses of up to 1000 mcg / kg / day , had no effect on the fertility and reproductive function of male and female rats .
However , the number of implantation sites and live embryos were significantly reduced in rats at the 1000 mcg / kg / day dose as compared to control .
The number of dead or resorbed embryos in the 1000 mcg / kg / day group was higher compared to the control group , but was not statistically significant .
The 1000 mcg / kg / day dose in rats is approximately 169 times the highest recommended human dose of 48 mcg / day , based on body surface area .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Chronic Idiopathic Constipation Two double - blinded , placebo - controlled studies of identical design were conducted in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation .
Chronic idiopathic constipation was defined as , on average , less than 3 spontaneous bowel movements ( SBMs ) per week ( a SBM is a bowel movement occurring in the absence of laxative use ) along with one or more of the following symptoms of constipation for at least 6 months prior to randomization : 1 ) very hard stools for at least a quarter of all bowel movements ; 2 ) sensation of incomplete evacuation following at least a quarter of all bowel movements ; and 3 ) straining with defecation at least a quarter of the time .
Following a 2 - week baseline / washout period , a total of 479 patients ( mean age 47 . 2 [ range 20 – 81 ] years ; 88 . 9 % female ; 80 . 8 % Caucasian , 9 . 6 % African American , 7 . 3 % Hispanic , 1 . 5 % Asian ; 10 . 9 % ≥ 65 years of age ) were randomized and received Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily or placebo twice daily for 4 weeks .
The primary endpoint of the studies was SBM frequency .
The studies demonstrated that patients treated with Amitiza had a higher frequency of SBMs during Week 1 than the placebo patients .
In both studies , results similar to those in Week 1 were also observed in Weeks 2 , 3 , and 4 of therapy ( Table 5 ) .

In both studies , Amitiza demonstrated increases in the percentage of patients who experienced SBMs within the first 24 hours after administration when compared to placebo ( 56 . 7 % vs . 36 . 9 % in Study 1 and 62 . 9 % vs . 31 . 9 % in Study 2 , respectively ) .
Similarly , the time to first SBM was shorter for patients receiving Amitiza than for those receiving placebo .
Signs and symptoms related to constipation , including abdominal bloating , abdominal discomfort , stool consistency , and straining , as well as constipation severity ratings , were also improved with Amitiza versus placebo .
The results were consistent in subpopulation analyses for gender , race , and elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years of age ) .
During a 7 - week randomized withdrawal study , patients who received Amitiza during a 4 - week treatment period were then randomized to receive either placebo or to continue treatment with Amitiza .
In Amitiza - treated patients randomized to placebo , SBM frequency rates returned toward baseline within 1 week and did not result in worsening compared to baseline .
Patients who continued on Amitiza maintained their response to therapy over the additional 3 weeks of treatment .
14 . 2 Opioid - induced Constipation The efficacy of Amitiza in the treatment of opioid - induced constipation in patients receiving opioid therapy for chronic , non - cancer - related pain was assessed in three randomized , double - blinded , placebo - controlled studies .
In Study 1 , the median age was 52 years ( range 20 – 82 ) and 63 . 1 % were female .
In Study 2 , the median age was 50 years ( range 21 – 77 ) and 64 . 4 % were female .
In Study 3 , the median age was 50 years ( range 21 – 89 ) and 60 . 1 % were female .
Patients had been receiving stable opioid therapy for at least 30 days prior to screening , which was to continue throughout the 12 - week treatment period .
At baseline , mean oral morphine equivalent daily doses ( MEDDs ) were 99 mg and 130 mg for placebo - treated and Amitiza - treated patients , respectively , in Study 1 .
Baseline mean MEDDs were 237 mg and 265 mg for placebo - treated and Amitiza - treated patients , respectively , in Study 2 .
In Study 3 , baseline mean MEDDs were 330 mg and 373 mg for placebo - treated and Amitiza - treated patients , respectively .
The Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form ( BPI - SF ) questionnaire was administered to patients at baseline and monthly during the treatment period to assess pain control .
Patients had documented opioid - induced constipation at baseline , defined as having less than 3 spontaneous bowel movements ( SBMs ) per week , with at least 25 % of SBMs associated with one or more of the following conditions : ( 1 ) hard to very hard stool consistency ; ( 2 ) moderate to very severe straining ; and / or ( 3 ) having a sensation of incomplete evacuation .
Laxative use was discontinued at the beginning of the screening period and throughout the study .
With the exception of the 48 - hour period prior to first dose and for at least 72 hours ( Study 1 ) or 1 week ( Study 2 and Study 3 ) following first dose , use of rescue medication was allowed in cases where no bowel movement had occurred in a 3 - day period .
Median weekly SBM frequencies at baseline were 1 . 5 for placebo patients and 1 . 0 for Amitiza patients in Study 1 and , for both Study 2 and Study 3 , median weekly SBM frequencies at baseline were 1 . 5 for both treatment groups .
In Study 1 , patients receiving non - diphenylheptane ( e . g . , non - methadone ) opioids ( n = 431 ) were randomized to receive placebo ( n = 217 ) or Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily ( n = 214 ) for 12 weeks .
The primary efficacy analysis was a comparison of the proportion of “ overall responders ” in each treatment arm .
A patient was considered an “ overall responder ” if ≥ 1 SBM improvement over baseline were reported for all treatment weeks for which data were available ≥ 3 SBMs / week were reported for at least 9 of 12 treatment weeks .
The proportion of patients in Study 1 qualifying as an “ overall responder ” was 27 . 1 % in the group receiving Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily compared to 18 . 9 % of patients receiving placebo twice daily ( treatment difference = 8 . 2 % ; p - value = 0 . 03 ) .
Examination of gender and race subgroups did not identify differences in response to Amitiza among these subgroups .
There were too few elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years of age ) to adequately assess differences in effects in that population .
and In Study 2 , patients receiving opioids ( N = 418 ) were randomized to receive placebo ( n = 208 ) or Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily ( n = 210 ) for 12 weeks .
Study 2 did not exclude patients receiving diphenylheptane opioids ( e . g . , methadone ) .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in SBM frequency at Week 8 ; 3 . 3 vs . 2 . 4 for Amitiza and placebo - treated patients , respectively ; treatment difference = 0 . 9 ; p - value = 0 . 004 .
The proportion of patients in Study 2 qualifying as an “ overall responder , ” as prespecified in Study 1 , was 24 . 3 % in the group receiving Amitiza compared to 15 . 4 % of patients receiving placebo .
In the subgroup of patients in Study 2 taking diphenylheptane opioids ( baseline mean [ median ] MEDDs of 691 [ 403 ] mg and 672 [ 450 ] mg for placebo and Amitiza patients , respectively ) , the proportion of patients qualifying as an “ overall responder ” was 20 . 5 % ( 8 / 39 ) in the group receiving Amitiza compared to 6 . 3 % ( 2 / 32 ) of patients receiving placebo .
Examination of gender and race subgroups did not identify differences in response to Amitiza among these subgroups .
There were too few elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years of age ) to adequately assess differences in effects in that population .
In Study 3 , patients receiving opioids ( N = 451 ) were randomized to placebo ( n = 216 ) or Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily ( n = 235 ) for 12 weeks .
Study 3 did not exclude patients receiving diphenylheptane opioids ( e . g . , methadone ) .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in SBM frequency at Week 8 .
The study did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in SBM frequency rates at Week 8 ( mean change from baseline of 2 . 7 vs . 2 . 5 for Amitiza and placebo - treated patients , respectively ; treatment difference = 0 . 2 ; p - value = 0 . 76 ) .
The proportion of patients in Study 3 qualifying as an “ overall responder , ” as prespecified in Study 1 , was 15 . 3 % in the patients receiving Amitiza compared to 13 . 0 % of patients receiving placebo .
In the subgroup of patients in Study 3 taking diphenylheptane opioids ( baseline mean [ median ] MEDDs of 730 [ 518 ] mg and 992 [ 480 ] mg for placebo and Amitiza patients , respectively ) , the proportion of patients qualifying as an “ overall responder ” was 2 . 1 % ( 1 / 47 ) in the group receiving Amitiza compared to 12 . 2 % ( 5 / 41 ) of patients receiving placebo .
14 . 3 Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation Two double - blinded , placebo - controlled studies of similar design were conducted in patients with IBS - C .
IBS was defined as abdominal pain or discomfort occurring over at least 6 months with two or more of the following : 1 ) relieved with defecation ; 2 ) onset associated with a change in stool frequency ; and 3 ) onset associated with a change in stool form .
Patients were sub - typed as having IBS - C if they also experienced two of three of the following : 1 ) < 3 spontaneous bowel movements ( SBMs ) per week , 2 ) > 25 % hard stools , and 3 ) > 25 % SBMs associated with straining .
Following a 4 - week baseline / washout period , a total of 1154 patients ( mean age 46 . 6 [ range 18 – 85 ] years ; 91 . 6 % female ; 77 . 4 % Caucasian , 13 . 2 % African American , 8 . 5 % Hispanic , 0 . 4 % Asian ; 8 . 3 % ≥ 65 years of age ) were randomized and received Amitiza 8 mcg twice daily ( 16 mcg / day ) or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks .
The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed weekly utilizing the patient ' s response to a global symptom relief question based on a 7 - point , balanced scale ( " significantly worse " to " significantly relieved " ) : " How would you rate your relief of IBS symptoms ( abdominal discomfort / pain , bowel habits , and other IBS symptoms ) over the past week compared to how you felt before you entered the study ? "
The primary efficacy analysis was a comparison of the proportion of " overall responders " in each arm .
A patient was considered an " overall responder " if the criteria for being designated a " monthly responder " were met in at least 2 of the 3 months on study .
A " monthly responder " was defined as a patient who had reported " significantly relieved " for at least 2 weeks of the month or at least " moderately relieved " in all 4 weeks of that month .
During each monthly evaluation period , patients reporting " moderately worse " or " significantly worse " relief , an increase in rescue medication use , or those who discontinued due to lack of efficacy , were deemed non - responders .
The percentage of patients in Study 1 qualifying as an " overall responder " was 13 . 8 % in the group receiving Amitiza 8 mcg twice daily compared to 7 . 8 % of patients receiving placebo twice daily .
In Study 2 , 12 . 1 % of patients in the Amitiza 8 mcg group were " overall responders " versus 5 . 7 % of patients in the placebo group .
In both studies , the treatment differences between the placebo and Amitiza groups were statistically significant .
The two randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blinded studies comprised 97 ( 8 . 4 % ) male patients , which is insufficient to determine whether men with IBS - C respond differently to Amitiza from women .
Results in men : During a 4 - week randomized withdrawal period following Study 1 , patients who received Amitiza during the 12 - week treatment period were re - randomized to receive either placebo or to continue treatment with Amitiza .
In Amitiza - treated patients who were “ overall responders ” during Study 1 and who were re - randomized to placebo , SBM frequency rates did not result in worsening compared to baseline .
