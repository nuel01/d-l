7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The possibility of interactions of Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection with other drugs taken by patients undergoing PET imaging has not been studied .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : No human or animal data .
Any radiopharmaceutical , including Sodium Fluoride F18 injection , may cause fetal harm .
Use only if clearly needed ( 8 . 1 ) • Nursing : A decision should be made whether to interrupt nursing after Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection administration or not to administer Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection taking into consideration the importance of the drug to the mother .
( 8 . 3 ) .
• Pediatrics : Children are more sensitive to radiation and may be at higher risk of cancer from Sodium Fluoride F18 injection ( 8 . 4 ) .
See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Any radiopharmaceutical including Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection has a potential to cause fetal harm .
The likelihood of fetal harm depends on the stage of fetal development , and the radionuclide dose .
Animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection .
Prior to the administration of Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection to women of childbearing potential , assess for presence of pregnancy .
Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection is excreted into human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , a decision should be made whether to interrupt nursing after administration of Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection or not to administer Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
The body of scientific information related to radioactivity decay , drug tissue distribution and drug elimination shows that less than 0 . 01 % of the radioactivity administered remains in the body after 24 hours ( 10 half - lives ) .
To minimize the risks to a nursing infant , interrupt nursing for at least 24 hours .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use In reported clinical experience in approximately 100 children , weight based doses ( 2 . 1 MBq / kg ) ranging from 19 MBq – 148 MBq ( 0 . 5 mCi - 4 mCi ) were used .
Sodium Fluoride F18 was shown to localize to areas of bone turnover including rapidly growing epiphyses in developing long bones .
Children are more sensitive to radiation and may be at higher risk of cancer from Sodium Fluoride F18 injection .
11 DESCRIPTION 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection , USP is a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical , containing no - carrier - added , radioactive fluoride F18 that is used for diagnostic purposes in conjunction with PET imaging .
It is administered by intravenous injection .
The active ingredient , sodium fluoride F18 , has the molecular formula Na [ 18 F ] with a molecular weight of 40 . 99 , and has the following chemical structure : Na + 18 F - Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection , USP is provided as a ready - to - use , isotonic , sterile , pyrogen - free , preservative - free , clear and colorless solution .
Each mL of the solution contains between 374 MBq to 7 , 400 MBq ( 10 mCi to 200 mCi ) sodium fluoride F18 , at the EOS reference time , in 0 . 9 % aqueous sodium chloride .
The pH of the solution is between 4 . 5 and 8 .
The solution is presented in 10 mL and 30 mL multiple - dose glass vials with variable total volume and total radioactivity in each vial .
11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Fluoride F18 decays by positron ( β + ) emission and has a half - life of 109 . 7 minutes .
Ninety - seven percent of the decay results in emission of a positron with a maximum energy of 633 keV and 3 % of the decay results in electron capture with subsequent emission of characteristic X - rays of oxygen .
The principal photons useful for diagnostic imaging are the 511 keV gamma photons , resulting from the interaction of the emitted positron with an electron ( Table 2 ) .
Fluorine F18 atom decays to stable 18 O - oxygen .

C . Radioactive Decay Data Tables DOE / TIC - 11026 , 69 , 1981 .
The specific gamma ray constant ( point source air kerma coefficient ) for fluoride F18 is 5 . 7 R / hr / mCi ( 1 . 35 x 10 - 6 Gy / hr / kBq ) at 1 cm .
The half - value layer ( HVL ) for the 511 keV photons is 4 mm lead ( Pb ) .
A range of values for the attenuation of radiation results from the interposition of various thickness of Pb .
The range of attenuation coefficients for this radionuclide is shown in Table 3 .
For example , the interposition of an 8 mm thickness of Pb with a coefficient of attenuation of 0 . 25 will decrease the external radiation by 75 % .

12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Increased fluoride F18 ion deposition in bone can occur in areas of increased osteogenic activity during growth , infection , malignancy ( primary or metastatic ) following trauma , or inflammation of bone .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous administration , fluoride F18 ion is rapidly cleared from the plasma in a biexponential manner .
The first phase has a half - life of 0 . 4 h , and the second phase has a half - life of 2 . 6 h . Essentially all the fluoride F18 that is delivered to bone by the blood is retained in the bone .
One hour after administration of fluoride F18 only about 10 % of the injected dose remains in the blood .
Fluoride F18 diffuses through capillaries into bone extracellular fluid space , where it becomes bound by chemisorption at the surface of bone crystals , preferentially at sites of newly mineralizing bone .
Deposition of fluoride F18 in bone appears to be primarily a function of blood flow to the bone and the efficiency of the bone in extracting the fluoride F18 .
Fluoride F18 does not appear to be bound to serum proteins .
In patients with normal renal function , 20 % or more of the fluorine ion is cleared from the body in the urine within the first 2 hours after intravenous administration .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies to assess reproductive toxicity , mutagenesis and carcinogenesis potential of Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection have not been performed .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Metastatic Bone Desease The doses used in reported studies ranged from 2 . 7 mCi to 20 mCi ( 100 MBq to 740 MBq ) , with an average median dose of 10 mCi ( 370 MBq ) and an average mean dose of 9 . 2 mCi ( 340 MBq ) .
In PET imaging of bone metastases with Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection , focally increased tracer uptake is seen in both osteolytic and osteoblastic bone lesions .
Negative PET imaging results with Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection do not preclude the diagnosis of bone metastases .
Also , as benign bone lesions are also detected by Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection , positive PET imaging results cannot replace biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of cancer .
14 . 2 Other Bone Disorders The doses used in reported studies ranged from 2 . 43 mCi to 15 mCi ( 90 MBq to 555 MBq ) , with an average median dose of 8 . 0 mCi ( 300 MBq ) and an average mean dose of 7 . 6 mCi ( 280 MBq ) .
