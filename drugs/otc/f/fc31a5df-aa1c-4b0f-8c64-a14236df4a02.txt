Monitor liver function tests in patients with hepatic impairment .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) : ( ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis ) : Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL develop skin rash .
Avoid amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL use in these patients .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Serious Allergic Reactions , Including Anaphylaxis Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity ( anaphylactic ) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta - lactam antibacterials , including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL .
These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and / or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens .
Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL , careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins , cephalosporins , or other allergens .
If an allergic reaction occurs , discontinue amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL and institute appropriate therapy .
5 . 2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions ( SCAR ) , such as Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) , and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) .
If patients develop a skin rash , they should be monitored closely , and Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL discontinued if lesions progress .
5 . 3 Hepatic Dysfunction Use amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL with caution in patients with evidence of hepatic dysfunction .
Hepatic toxicity associated with the use of Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL is usually reversible .
Deaths have been reported ( fewer than one death reported per estimated four million prescriptions worldwide ) .
These have generally been cases associated with serious underlying diseases or concomitant medications [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 4 Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea ( CDAD ) Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin - producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibacterial treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 5 Skin Rash in Patients with Mononucleosis A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash .
Thus , amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis .
5 . 6 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy .
If superinfections occur ( usually involving Pseudomonas spp .
or Candida spp . )
, the drug should be discontinued , and appropriate therapy instituted .
5 . 7 Phenylketonurics Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL contains aspartame which contains phenylalanine .
Each 5 mL of the 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL Powder for Oral Suspension contains 7 mg phenylalanine .
5 . 8 Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria Prescribing amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] : • • Anaphylactic reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions ( SCAR ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Hepatic Dysfunction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • • Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea ( CDAD ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diaper rash ( 4 % ) , diarrhea ( 3 % ) , vomiting ( 2 % ) , candidiasis ( 1 % ) , and rash ( 1 % ) .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc . at 1 - 877 - 233 - 2001 , or the FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Two clinical trials evaluated the safety of a 10 - day treatment course of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL 90 / 6 . 4 mg / kg / day , divided every 12 hours , in pediatric patients with acute otitis media [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The first trial involved 521 pediatric patients ( 3 months to 50 months ) and the second trial involved 450 pediatric patients ( 3 months to 12 years ) .
In the intent - to - treat population of the first trial of 521 patients , the most frequently reported adverse events were vomiting ( 7 % ) , fever ( 6 % ) , contact dermatitis ( i . e . , diaper rash ) ( 6 % ) , upper respiratory tract infection ( 4 % ) , and diarrhea ( 4 % ) .
Protocol - defined diarrhea ( i . e . , 3 or more watery stools in one day or 2 watery stools per day for 2 consecutive days as recorded on diary cards ) occurred in 13 % of patients .
The primary objective of the second study was to compare the safety of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL ( 90 / 6 . 4 mg / kg / day , divided every 12 hours ) to amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium ( 45 / 6 . 4 mg / kg / day , divided every 12 hours ) for ten days .
There was no statistically significant difference between treatments in the proportion of patients with 1 or more adverse events .
The most frequently reported adverse reactions for amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL and the comparator of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium were coughing ( 12 % versus 7 % ) , vomiting ( 7 % versus 8 % ) , contact dermatitis ( i . e . , diaper rash , 6 % versus 5 % ) , fever ( 6 % versus 4 % ) , and upper respiratory infection ( 3 % versus 9 % ) , respectively .
The frequencies of protocol - defined diarrhea with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL ( 11 % ) and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium ( 9 % ) were not statistically different .
Two patients in the group treated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL and one patient in the group treated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium were withdrawn due to diarrhea .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials , the following have been identified during postmarketing use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium products , including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL .
Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness , frequency of reporting , or potential causal connection to amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium .
Gastrointestinal : Diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , indigestion , gastritis , stomatitis , glossitis , black “ hairy ” tongue , mucocutaneous candidiasis , enterocolitis , and hemorrhagic / pseudomembranous colitis .
Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
Immune : Hypersensitivity reactions , anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions ( including shock ) , angioedema , serum sickness - like reactions ( urticaria or skin rash accompanied by arthritis , arthralgia , myalgia , and frequently fever ) , hypersensitivity vasculitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Skin and Appendages : Rashes , pruritus , urticaria , erythema multiforme , SJS , TEN , DRESS , AGEP , exfoliative dermatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Liver : A moderate rise in AST ( SGOT ) and / or ALT ( SGPT ) has been noted in patients treated with ampicillin - class antibacterials .
Hepatic dysfunction , including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice , increases in serum transaminases ( AST and / or ALT ) , serum bilirubin , and / or alkaline phosphatase , has been infrequently reported with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium or amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL .
It has been reported more commonly in the elderly , in males , or in patients on prolonged treatment .
The histologic findings on liver biopsy have consisted of cholestatic , hepatocellular , or mixed cholestatic - hepatocellular changes .
The onset of signs / symptoms of hepatic dysfunction may occur during or several weeks after therapy has been discontinued .
The hepatic dysfunction , which may be severe , is usually reversible .
Deaths have been reported [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Renal : Interstitial nephritis and hematuria have been reported .
Crystalluria has also been reported [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
Hemic and Lymphatic Systems : Anemia , including hemolytic anemia , thrombocytopenia , thrombocytopenic purpura , eosinophilia , leukopenia , and agranulocytosis have been reported during therapy with penicillins .
These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena .
There have been reports of increased prothrombin time in patients receiving amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium and anticoagulant therapy concomitantly .
Central Nervous System : Agitation , anxiety , behavioral changes , aseptic meningitis , confusion , convulsions , dizziness , insomnia , and reversible hyperactivity have been reported rarely .
Miscellaneous : Tooth discoloration ( brown , yellow , or gray staining ) has been rarely reported .
Most reports occurred in pediatric patients .
Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Co - administration with probenecid is not recommended .
( 7 . 1 ) • • Concomitant use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL with oral anticoagulants may increase the prolongation of prothrombin time .
( 7 . 2 ) • • Co - administration with allopurinol increases the risk of rash .
( 7 . 3 ) • • Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL may reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives .
( 7 . 4 ) 7 . 1 Probenecid Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin .
Concurrent use with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin .
Coadministration of probenecid is not recommended .
7 . 2 Oral Anticoagulants Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time ( increased international normalized ratio [ INR ] ) has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants .
Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently .
Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation .
7 . 3 Allopurinol The concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone .
It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients .
There are no data with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL and allopurinol administered concurrently .
7 . 4 Oral Contraceptives Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL may affect intestinal flora , leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen / progesterone contraceptives .
7 . 5 Effects on Laboratory Tests High urine concentrations of amoxicillin may result in false - positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST ® , Benedict ’ s Solution , or Fehling ’ s Solution .
Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL , it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be used .
Following administration of amoxicillin to pregnant women , a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol , estriol - glucuronide , conjugated estrone , and estradiol has been noted .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Pediatric 3 months to 12 years old : Modify dose according to weight .
( 2 . 2 , 8 . 4 ) • • Adults and pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg : The safety and effectiveness of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL has not been established .
( 8 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rats and mice given amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium ( 2 : 1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin : clavulanate ) at oral dosages up to 1200 mg / kg / day revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium .
The amoxicillin doses in rodents ( based on body surface area and assuming a 20 kg child ) were approximately 2 times ( rats ) or equal to ( mice ) the recommended clinical amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL dose of 90 / 6 . 4 mg / kg / day .
For clavulanate , these dose multiples were approximately 15 times and 7 . 5 times the recommended daily dose of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL .
8 . 2 Labor and Delivery Oral ampicillin - class antibacterial drugs are generally poorly absorbed during labor .
Studies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone , frequency of contractions , height of contractions , and duration of contractions .
However , it is not known whether the use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus , prolongs the duration of labor , or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary .
In a single study in women with premature rupture of fetal membranes , it was reported that prophylactic treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium may be associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Ampicillin - class antibacterial drugs are excreted in human milk ; therefore , caution should be exercised when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL in infants younger than 3 months have not been established .
Safety and efficacy of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL have been demonstrated for treatment of acute otitis media in infants and children 3 months to 12 years [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL have been established for the treatment of pediatric patients ( 3 months to 12 years ) with acute bacterial sinusitis .
This use is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium extended release tablets in adults with acute bacterial sinusitis , studies of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL in pediatric patients with acute otitis media , and by similar pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin and clavulanate in pediatric patients taking amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 ) ] and adults taking amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium extended release tablets .
10 OVERDOSAGE Following overdosage , patients have experienced primarily gastrointestinal symptoms including stomach and abdominal pain , vomiting , and diarrhea .
Rash , hyperactivity , or drowsiness have also been observed in a small number of patients .
In the case of overdosage , discontinue amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL , treat symptomatically , and institute supportive measures as required .
If the overdosage is very recent and there is no contraindication , an attempt at emesis or other means of removal of drug from the stomach may be performed .
A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison control center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg / kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms and do not require gastric emptying . 1 Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin .
Crystalluria , in some cases leading to renal failure , has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients .
In case of overdosage , adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria .
Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration .
High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of both amoxicillin and clavulanate .
Both amoxicillin and clavulanate are removed from the circulation by hemodialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension , USP 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL is an oral antibacterial combination consisting of the semisynthetic antibacterial amoxicillin and the beta - lactamase inhibitor , clavulanate potassium ( the potassium salt of clavulanic acid ) .
Amoxicillin is an analog of ampicillin , derived from the basic penicillin nucleus , 6 - aminopenicillanic acid .
The amoxicillin molecular formula is C16H19N3O5S • 3H2O , and the molecular weight is 419 . 46 .
Chemically , amoxicillin is ( 2 S , 5 R , 6 R ) - 6 - [ ( R ) - ( - ) - 2 - Amino - 2 - ( p - hydroxyphenyl ) acetamido ] - 3 , 3 - dimethyl - 7 - oxo - 4 - thia - 1 - azabicyclo [ 3 . 2 . 0 ] heptane - 2 - carboxylic acid trihydrate and may be represented structurally as : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clavulanic acid is produced by the fermentation of Streptomyces clavuligerus .
It is a beta - lactam structurally related to the penicillins and possesses the ability to inactivate a wide variety of beta - lactamases by blocking the active sites of these enzymes .
Clavulanic acid is particularly active against the clinically important plasmid - mediated beta - lactamases frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins .
The clavulanate potassium molecular formula is C8H8KNO5 and the molecular weight is 237 . 25 .
Chemically , clavulanate potassium is potassium ( Z ) - ( 2 R , 5 R ) - 3 - ( 2 - hydroxyethylidene ) - 7 - oxo - 4 - oxa - 1 - azabicyclo [ 3 . 2 . 0 ] - heptane - 2 - carboxylate and may be represented structurally as : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Inactive Ingredients : Aspartame , colloidal silicon dioxide , hypromellose , orange powder flavor , silicon dioxide , succinic acid , xanthan gum [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Each 5 mL of reconstituted amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL contains 0 . 248 mEq potassium .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL is an antibacterial drug [ seeMicrobiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin and clavulanate were determined in a study of 19 pediatric patients , 8 months to 11 years , given amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL at an amoxicillin dose of 45 mg / kg q12h with a snack or meal .
The mean plasma amoxicillin and clavulanate pharmacokinetic parameter values are listed in the following table .
Table 1 .
Mean ( ± SD ) Plasma Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values Following Administration of 45 mg / kg of Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL Every 12 Hours to Pediatric Patients PARAMETER AMOXICILLIN CLAVULANATE Cmax ( mcg / mL ) 15 . 7 ± 7 . 7 1 . 7 ± 0 . 9 Tmax ( hour ) 2 . 0 ( 1 . 0 to 4 . 0 ) 1 . 1 ( 1 . 0 to 4 . 0 ) AUC0 - T ( mcg * hour / mL ) 59 . 8 ± 20 . 0 4 . 0 ± 1 . 9 T ½ ( hour ) 1 . 4 ± 0 . 3 1 . 1 ± 0 . 3 CL / F ( L / hour / kg ) 0 . 9 ± 0 . 4 1 . 1 ± 1 . 1 * Arithmetic mean ± standard deviation , except Tmax values which are medians ( ranges ) .
The effect of food on the oral absorption of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL has not been studied .
Approximately 50 % to 70 % of the amoxicillin and approximately 25 % to 40 % of the clavulanic acid are excreted unchanged in urine during the first 6 hours after administration of 10 mL of 250 mg / 5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium .
Concurrent administration of probenecid delays amoxicillin excretion but does not delay renal excretion of clavulanic acid .
Neither component in amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL is highly protein - bound ; clavulanic acid has been found to be approximately 25 % bound to human serum and amoxicillin approximately 18 % bound .
Oral administration of a single dose of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL at 45 mg / kg ( based on the amoxicillin component ) to pediatric patients , 9 months to 8 years , yielded the following pharmacokinetic data for amoxicillin in plasma and middle ear fluid ( MEF ) : Table 2 .
Amoxicillin Concentrations in Plasma and Middle Ear Fluid Following Administration of 45 mg / kg of Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL to Pediatric Patients Timepoint Amoxicillin concentration in plasma ( mcg / mL ) Amoxicillin concentration in MEF ( mcg / mL ) 1 hour mean median range 7 . 7 9 . 3 1 . 5 to 14 . 0 ( n equals 5 ) 3 . 2 3 . 5 0 . 2 to 5 . 5 ( n equals 4 ) 2 hour mean median range 15 . 7 13 . 0 11 . 0 to 25 . 0 ( n equals 7 ) 3 . 3 2 . 4 1 . 9 to 6 ( n equals 5 ) 3 hour mean median range 13 . 0 12 . 0 5 . 5 to 21 . 0 ( n equals 5 ) 5 . 8 6 . 5 3 . 9 to 7 . 4 ( n equals 5 ) Dose administered immediately prior to eating .
Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids , with the exception of the brain and spinal fluid .
The results of experiments involving the administration of clavulanic acid to animals suggest that this compound , like amoxicillin , is well distributed in body tissues .
12 . 4 Microbiology Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibacterial with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram - positive and gram - negative microorganisms .
Amoxicillin is , however , susceptible to degradation by β - lactamases , and therefore , its spectrum of activity does not include organisms which produce these enzymes .
Clavulanic acid is a β - lactam , structurally related to penicillin , which possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of β - lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins .
In particular , it has good activity against the clinically important plasmid - mediated β - lactamases frequently found responsible for transferred drug resistance .
The clavulanic acid component of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL protects amoxicillin from degradation by β - lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin and other β - lactam antibacterials .
Thus , amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL possesses the distinctive properties of a broad spectrum antibacterial and a β - lactamase inhibitor .
Amoxicillin / clavulanic acid has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Gram - positive bacteria : Streptococcus pneumoniae ( including isolates with penicillin MICs less than or equal to 2 mcg / mL ) Gram - negative bacteria : Haemophilus influenzae ( including β - lactamase - producing isolates ) Moraxella catarrhalis ( including β - lactamase - producing isolates ) The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
At least 90 % of the following microorganisms exhibit in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for amoxicillin / clavulanic acid .
However , the safety and efficacy of amoxicillin / clavulanic acid in treating infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well - controlled trials .
Gram - positive bacteria : Staphylococcus aureus ( including β - lactamase - producing isolates ) Staphylococci which are resistant to methicillin / oxacillin must be considered resistant to amoxicillin / clavulanic acid .
Streptococcus pyogenes S . pyogenes do not produce β - lactamase , and therefore , are susceptible to amoxicillin alone .
Adequate and well - controlled clinical trials have established the effectiveness of amoxicillin alone in treating certain clinical infections due to S . pyogenes .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential .
Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium ( 4 : 1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin : clavulanate ) was non - mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay , and the yeast gene conversion assay .
Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay , but the trend toward increased mutation frequencies in this assay occurred at concentrations that were also associated with decreased cell survival .
Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was negative in the mouse micronucleus test , and in the dominant lethal assay in mice .
Potassium clavulanate alone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay and in the mouse micronucleus test and was negative in each of these assays .
Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium ( 2 : 1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin : clavulanate ) at oral doses of up to 1 , 200 mg / kg / day was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance in rats .
Based on body surface area ( assuming a 20 kg child ) , this dose of amoxicillin is approximately 2 times the recommended clinical amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL dose of 90 / 6 . 4 mg / kg / day .
For clavulanate , the dose multiple is approximately 15 times higher than the recommended clinical daily dose , also based on body surface area .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two clinical studies were conducted in pediatric patients with acute otitis media .
A noncomparative , open - label study assessed the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL ( 90 / 6 . 4 mg / kg / day , divided every 12 hours ) for 10 days in 521 pediatric patients ( 3 to 50 months ) with acute otitis media .
The primary objective was to assess bacteriological response in children with acute otitis media due to S . pneumoniae with amoxicillin / clavulanic acid MICs of 4 mcg / mL .
The study sought the enrollment of patients with the following risk factors : Failure of antibacterial therapy for acute otitis media in the previous 3 months , history of recurrent episodes of acute otitis media , 2 years or younger , or daycare attendance .
Prior to receiving amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL , all patients had tympanocentesis to obtain middle ear fluid for bacteriological evaluation .
Patients from whom S . pneumoniae ( alone or in combination with other bacteria ) was isolated had a second tympanocentesis 4 to 6 days after the start of therapy .
Clinical assessments were planned for all patients during treatment ( 4 to 6 days after starting therapy ) , as well as 2 to 4 days post - treatment and 15 to 18 days post - treatment .
Bacteriological success was defined as the absence of the pretreatment pathogen from the on - therapy tympanocentesis specimen .
Clinical success was defined as improvement or resolution of signs and symptoms .
Clinical failure was defined as lack of improvement or worsening of signs and / or symptoms at any time following at least 72 hours of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension 600 mg / 42 . 9 mg per 5 mL ; patients who received an additional systemic antibacterial drug for otitis media after 3 days of therapy were considered clinical failures .
Bacteriological eradication on therapy ( day 4 to 6 visit ) in the per protocol population is summarized in the following table : Table 3 .

Clinical assessments were made in the per protocol population 2 to 4 days post - therapy and 15 to 18 days post - therapy .
Patients who responded to therapy 2 to 4 days post - therapy were followed for 15 to 18 days post - therapy to assess them for acute otitis media .
Non - responders at 2 to 4 days post - therapy were considered failures at the latter timepoint .
