6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of SOTYKTU was evaluated in two placebo - and active - controlled trials ( PSO - 1 and PSO - 2 ) and an open - label extension trial in which subjects who completed PSO - 1 or PSO - 2 could enroll [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
In these clinical trials , a total of 1 , 519 subjects with moderate - to - severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy received SOTYKTU 6 mg orally once daily .
Of these , 1 , 141 subjects were exposed to SOTYKTU for at least one year .
In trials PSO - 1 and PSO - 2 , 1 , 681 subjects were randomized to receive SOTYKTU 6 mg ( 840 subjects ) , placebo ( 419 subjects ) , or apremilast 30 mg twice daily ( 422 subjects ) .
All subjects randomized to placebo switched to SOTYKTU at Week 16 .
All other subjects remained in their original treatment group until Week 24 , at which point subjects could have continued on the same treatment or be switched to SOTYKTU or placebo .
The mean age of subjects was 47 years .
The majority of subjects were White ( 87 % ) and male ( 67 % ) .
In the 16 - week placebo - controlled period of the pooled clinical trials ( PSO - 1 and PSO - 2 ) , discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions in subjects who received SOTYKTU was 2 . 4 % , compared to 3 . 8 % for placebo .
Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1 % of subjects in the SOTYKTU group and at a higher rate than the placebo group during the 16 - week controlled period .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions that Occurred in ≥ 1 % of Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis in the SOTYKTU Group and More Frequently than in the Placebo Group in Trials PSO - 1 and PSO - 2 through Week 16 a Includes upper respiratory tract infection ( viral , bacterial , and unspecified ) , nasopharyngitis , pharyngitis ( including viral , streptococcal , and unspecified ) , sinusitis ( includes acute , viral , bacterial ) , rhinitis , rhinotracheitis , tracheitis , laryngitis , and tonsillitis ( including bacterial , streptococcal ) b Includes oral herpes , genital herpes , herpes simplex , and herpes virus infection c Includes mouth ulceration , aphthous ulcer , tongue ulceration , and stomatitis d Includes acne , acne cystic , and dermatitis acneiform Adverse Reaction SOTYKTU 6 mg once daily Placebo N = 840 n ( % ) N = 419 n ( % ) Upper respiratory infectionsa 161 ( 19 . 2 ) 62 ( 14 . 8 ) Blood creatine phosphokinase increased 23 ( 2 . 7 ) 5 ( 1 . 2 ) Herpes simplexb 17 ( 2 . 0 ) 1 ( 0 . 2 ) Mouth ulcersc 16 ( 1 . 9 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Folliculitis 14 ( 1 . 7 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Acned 12 ( 1 . 4 ) 1 ( 0 . 2 ) Adverse reactions that occurred in < 1 % of subjects in the SOTYKTU group were herpes zoster .
Specific Adverse Reactions Exposure adjusted incidence rates are reported for all the adverse reactions presented below .
Infections In the 16 - week placebo - controlled period , infections occurred in 29 % of the SOTYKTU group ( 116 events per 100 person - years ) compared to 22 % of the placebo group ( 83 . 7 events per 100 person - years ) .
The majority of infections were non - serious and mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of SOTYKTU .
In the 16 - week placebo - controlled period , serious infections were reported in 5 subjects ( 2 . 0 per 100 patient - years ) treated with SOTYKTU , and 2 subjects ( 1 . 6 per 100 patient - years ) treated with placebo .
The most common serious infections reported during the 52 - week treatment period were pneumonia and COVID - 19 .
Malignancies During the 0 - to - 52 - week treatment period of the two clinical trials , PSO - 1 and PSO - 2 ( total exposure of 986 patient - years with SOTYKTU ) , malignancies ( excluding non - melanoma skin cancer ) were reported in 3 subjects treated with SOTYKTU ( 0 . 3 per 100 patient - years ) , including single cases each of breast cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma , and lymphoma after 24 , 32 , and 25 weeks of treatment , respectively .
During PSO - 1 , PSO - 2 , and the open - label extension trial in which subjects who completed the controlled trials could enroll , a total of 3 subjects ( 0 . 1 per 100 patient - years ) , developed lymphoma while receiving SOTYKTU after 25 , 77 , and 98 weeks of treatment .
Laboratory Abnormalities Creatine Phosphokinase ( CPK ) In the 16 - week placebo - controlled period , increased CPK ( including Grade 4 ) was reported in 23 subjects ( 9 . 3 per 100 patient - years ) treated with SOTYKTU , and 5 subjects ( 4 . 1 per 100 patient - years ) treated with placebo .
Liver Enzyme Elevations Events of increases in liver enzymes ≥ 3 times the ULN were observed in subjects treated with SOTYKTU [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
In the 16 - week placebo - controlled period : • • ALT elevations ≥ 3 times the ULN was reported in 9 subjects ( 3 . 6 per 100 patient - years ) treated with SOTYKTU , and 2 subjects ( 1 . 6 per 100 patient - years ) treated with placebo .
• • AST elevations ≥ 3 times the ULN was reported in 13 subjects ( 5 . 2 per 100 patient - years ) treated with SOTYKTU , and 2 subjects ( 1 . 6 per 100 patient - years ) treated with placebo .
Decreased Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) In the 16 - week placebo - controlled period in subjects who had moderate renal impairment ( eGFR 30 - 59 mL / min ) at baseline , decreased GFR was reported in 4 subjects ( 1 . 6 per 100 patient - years ) treated with SOTYKTU , and 1 subject ( 0 . 8 per 100 patient - years ) treated with placebo .
Two of the deucravacitinib - treated subjects had worsening of baseline proteinuria .
Lipid Elevations Mean triglycerides increased by 10 . 3 mg / dL during the 16 - week treatment period in subjects treated with SOTYKTU and by 9 . 1 mg / dL during the 52 - week treatment period .
Safety Through Week 52 In PSO - 1 and PSO - 2 , the exposure adjusted incidence rate of adverse reactions in subjects treated with SOTYKTU from Week 0 through Week 52 without switching treatment did not increase compared to the rate observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS SOTYKTU is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) .
( 2 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports on SOTYKTU use during pregnancy are insufficient to evaluate a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , no effects on embryo - fetal development were observed with oral administration of deucravacitinib to rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that were at least 91 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 6 mg once daily ( see Data ) .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Report pregnancies to the Bristol - Myers Squibb Company ’ s Adverse Event reporting line at 1 - 800 - 721 - 5072 .
Data Animal data Deucravacitinib was administered orally during the period of organogenesis at doses of 5 , 15 , or 75 mg / kg / day in rats and 1 , 3 , or 10 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
Deucravacitinib was not associated with embryo - fetal lethality or fetal malformations in either species .
These doses resulted in maternal exposures ( AUC ) that were 266 times ( rat ) or 91 times ( rabbit ) the exposure at the MRHD .
In a pre - and post - natal development study in rats , deucravacitinib was administered orally from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20 , at doses of 5 , 15 , or 50 mg / kg / day .
At 50 mg / kg / day , F1 offspring had reduced body weight gains during the pre - weaning period .
After weaning , body weights of affected F1 offspring gradually normalized to control levels .
No maternal effects were observed at 50 mg / kg / day ( 110 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison ) .
No deucravacitinib - related effects on postnatal developmental , neurobehavioral , or reproductive performance of offspring were noted at doses up to 15 mg / kg / day ( 19 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of deucravacitinib in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Deucravacitinib is present in rat milk .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk ( see Data ) .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for SOTYKTU and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from SOTYKTU or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data Animal Data A single oral dose of 5 mg / kg radiolabeled deucravacitinib was administered to lactating ( post - partum days 8 to 12 ) rats .
Deucravacitinib and / or its metabolites were present in the milk of lactating rats .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of SOTYKTU in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 1 , 519 subjects with plaque psoriasis treated with SOTYKTU , 152 ( 10 % ) subjects were 65 years or older and 21 ( 1 . 4 % ) subjects were 75 years or older .
During the Week 0 - 16 period , for those subjects ( 80 subjects ≥ 65 years old , including 12 subjects ≥ 75 years old ) who received SOTYKTU without switching treatment arms , there was a higher rate of overall serious adverse reactions , including serious infections , and discontinuations due to adverse reactions compared with younger adults .
No overall differences in effectiveness of SOTYKTU have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of SOTYKTU is recommended in patients with mild , moderate , or severe renal impairment or in patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) on dialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment of SOTYKTU is recommended in patients with mild ( Child - Pugh A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh B ) hepatic impairment .
SOTYKTU is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no experience regarding human overdosage with SOTYKTU .
In case of overdose , consider contacting the Poison Help line ( 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 ) for additional overdosage management recommendations .
The extent of deucravacitinib elimination by hemodialysis was small ( 5 . 4 % of dose per dialysis treatment ) , and thus hemodialysis for treatment of overdose with SOTYKTU is limited .
11 DESCRIPTION Deucravacitinib is a tyrosine kinase 2 ( TYK2 ) inhibitor and is described chemically as : 6 - ( cyclopropanecarbonylamido ) - 4 - [ 2 - methoxy - 3 - ( 1 - methyl - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazol - 3 - yl ) anilino ] - N - ( trideuteriomethyl ) pyridazine - 3 - carboxamide .
The molecular formula is C20H19D3N8O3 and the molecular weight of the free base is 425 . 47 .
Deucravacitinib has the structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Deucravacitinib is a white to yellow powder .
The solubility of deucravacitinib is pH dependent .
Solubility decreases with increasing pH . SOTYKTU ( deucravacitinib ) tablets are supplied in 6 mg strength for oral administration .
Each tablet contains deucravacitinib as the active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients : anhydrous lactose , croscarmellose sodium , hypromellose acetate succinate , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , and silicon dioxide .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Deucravacitinib is an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase 2 ( TYK2 ) .
TYK2 is a member of the Janus kinase ( JAK ) family .
Deucravacitinib binds to the regulatory domain of TYK2 , stabilizing an inhibitory interaction between the regulatory and the catalytic domains of the enzyme .
This results in allosteric inhibition of receptor - mediated activation of TYK2 and its downstream activation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription ( STATs ) as shown in cell - based assays .
JAK kinases , including TYK2 , function as pairs of homo - or heterodimers in the JAK - STAT pathways .
TYK2 pairs with JAK1 to mediate multiple cytokine pathways and also pairs with JAK2 to transmit signals as shown in cell - based assays .
The precise mechanism linking inhibition of TYK2 enzyme to therapeutic effectiveness in the treatment of adults with moderate - to - severe plaque psoriasis is not currently known .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with psoriasis , deucravacitinib reduced psoriasis - associated gene expression in psoriatic skin in a dose dependent manner , including reductions in IL - 23 - pathway and type I IFN pathway regulated genes .
Deucravacitinib reduced IL - 17 A , IL - 19 and beta - defensin by 47 to 50 % , 72 % , and 81 to 84 % respectively following 16 weeks of once daily treatment .
The relationship between these pharmacodynamic markers and the mechanism ( s ) by which deucravacitinib exerts its clinical effects is unknown .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 6 times the recommended dose of the 6 mg once daily in psoriasis patients , SOTYKTU does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration , deucravacitinib plasma Cmax and AUC increased proportionally over a dose range from 3 mg to 36 mg ( 0 . 5 to 6 times the approved recommended dosage ) in healthy subjects .
The accumulation of deucravacitinib was < 1 . 4 - fold following once daily dosing in healthy subjects .
The PK of deucravacitinib and its active metabolite , BMT ‑ 153261 , were comparable between healthy subjects and subjects with psoriasis .
The steady state Cmax and AUC24 of deucravacitinib following administration of 6 mg once daily were 45 ng / mL and 473 ng · hr / mL , respectively .
The steady state Cmax and AUC24 of the active deucravacitinib metabolite , BMT - 153261 , following administration of 6 mg once daily were 5 ng / mL and 95 ng · hr / mL , respectively .
Absorption The absolute oral bioavailability of deucravacitinib was 99 % and the median Tmax ranged from 2 to 3 hours in healthy subjects .
Food Effect No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of deucravacitinib were observed following administration of a high - fat , high - calorie meal ( 951 kcal in total , with approximate distribution of 52 % fat , 33 % carbohydrate and 15 % protein ) .
Cmax and AUC of deucravacitinib when administered with food were decreased by approximately 24 % and 11 % , respectively , and Tmax was prolonged by 1 hour .
Cmax and AUC of BMT - 153261 when administered with food were decreased by approximately 23 % and 10 % , respectively , and Tmax was prolonged by 2 hours .
Distribution The volume of distribution of deucravacitinib at steady state is 140 L . Protein binding of deucravacitinib was 82 to 90 % and the blood - to - plasma concentration ratio was 1 . 26 .
Elimination The terminal half - life of deucravacitinib was 10 hours .
The renal clearance of deucravacitinib ranged from 27 to 54 mL / minute .
Metabolism Deucravacitinib is metabolized by cytochrome P - 450 ( CYP ) 1A2 to form major metabolite BMT - 153261 .
Deucravacitinib is also metabolized by CYP2B6 , CYP2D6 , carboxylesterase ( CES ) 2 , and uridine glucuronyl transferase ( UGT ) 1A9 .
The active deucravacitinib metabolite , BMT - 153261 , has comparable potency to the parent drug , but the circulating exposure of BMT - 153261 accounts for approximately 20 % of the systemic exposure of the total drug - related components .
Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled deucravacitinib , approximately 13 % and 26 % of the dose was recovered as unchanged in urine and feces , respectively .
Approximately 6 % and 12 % of the dose was detected as BMT - 153261 in urine and feces , respectively .
Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Deucravacitinib Cmax was 14 % lower and 6 % higher in patients with mild ( eGFR ≥ 60 to < 90 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) and moderate ( eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) renal impairment , compared to subjects with normal renal function ( eGFR ≥ 90 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) ; no change in Cmax was observed in patients with severe ( eGFR < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) renal impairment , and ESRD ( eGFR < 15 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) on dialysis .

14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Plaque Psoriasis The efficacy and safety of SOTYKTU 6 mg once daily were assessed in two multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - and active - controlled clinical trials , PSO - 1 ( NCT03624127 ) and PSO - 2 ( NCT03611751 ) which enrolled subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate - to - severe plaque psoriasis who were eligible for systemic therapy or phototherapy .
Subjects had a body surface area ( BSA ) involvement of ≥ 10 % , a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI ) score ≥ 12 , and a static Physician ’ s Global Assessment ( sPGA ) ≥ 3 ( moderate or severe ) .
In PSO - 1 and PSO - 2 , efficacy was assessed in 1 , 684 subjects randomized to either SOTYKTU ( 6 mg orally once daily ) , placebo , or apremilast ( 30 mg orally twice daily ) .
Endpoints Both trials assessed the responses at Week 16 compared to placebo for the two co - primary endpoints : • • proportion of subjects who achieved a sPGA score of 0 ( clear ) or 1 ( almost clear ) with at least a 2 - grade improvement from baseline ; • • the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75 % improvement in PASI scores from baseline ( PASI 75 ) .
Other comparisons between SOTYKTU and placebo that were secondary endpoints at Week 16 : • • the proportion of subjects who achieved PASI 90 , PASI 100 , sPGA 0 , scalp severity PGA ( ss - PGA ) score of 0 ( clear ) or 1 ( almost clear ) with at least 2 - grade improvement , and Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary ( PSSD ) Symptom Score of 0 ( symptom - free ) .
Comparisons between SOTYKTU and apremilast were made for the following secondary endpoints at these time points : • • at Week 16 and Week 24 ( PSO - 1 and PSO - 2 ) , the proportion of subjects who achieved PASI 75 , PASI 90 , and sPGA 0 / 1 with at least a 2 - grade improvement from baseline • • at Week 16 ( PSO - 1 and PSO - 2 ) , the proportion of subjects who achieved sPGA 0 and ss - PGA 0 / 1 with at least a 2 - grade improvement from baseline ( scalp ) .
Results In both trials , the mean age was 47 years , the mean weight was 91 kg , 67 % of subjects were male , 13 % were Hispanic or Latino , 87 % were White , 2 % were Black , and 10 % were Asian .
At baseline , subjects had a median affected BSA of 20 % and a median PASI score of 19 .
The proportion of subjects with sPGA score of 3 ( moderate ) and 4 ( severe ) at baseline were 80 % and 20 % , respectively .
Approximately 18 % of subjects had a history of psoriatic arthritis .
Across both trials , 40 % of subjects had received prior phototherapy , 42 % were naive to any systemic therapy ( including biologic and / or non - biologic treatment ) , 41 % received prior non - biologic systemic treatment , and 35 % had received prior biologic therapy .

Maintenance and Durability of Response In PSO - 1 , among subjects who received SOTYKTU and had sPGA 0 / 1 response at Week 24 , the sPGA 0 / 1 response at Week 52 was 78 % ( 151 / 194 ) .
Among subjects who received SOTYKTU and had PASI 75 response at Week 24 , the PASI 75 response at Week 52 was 82 % ( 187 / 228 ) .
Among subjects who received SOTYKTU and had PASI 90 response at Week 24 , the PASI 90 response at Week 52 was 74 % ( 103 / 140 ) .
In PSO - 2 , to evaluate maintenance and durability of response , subjects who were originally randomized to SOTYKTU and were PASI 75 responders at Week 24 , were re - randomized to either continue treatment on SOTYKTU or be withdrawn from therapy ( i . e . , receive placebo ) .
For subjects who were re - randomized and also had a sPGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 24 , 70 % ( 83 / 118 ) of subjects who continued on SOTYKTU maintained this response ( sPGA 0 or 1 ) at Week 52 compared to 24 % ( 28 / 119 ) of subjects who were re - randomized to placebo .
In addition , at Week 52 , 80 % ( 119 / 148 ) of subjects who continued on SOTYKTU maintained PASI 75 compared to 31 % ( 47 / 150 ) of subjects who were withdrawn from SOTYKTU .
For sPGA 0 or 1 responders at Week 24 who were re - randomized to treatment withdrawal ( i . e . , placebo ) , the median time to loss of sPGA score of 0 or 1 was approximately 8 weeks .
For PASI 75 responders at Week 24 who were re - randomized to treatment withdrawal ( i . e . , placebo ) , the median time to loss of PASI 75 was approximately 12 weeks .
Patient Reported Outcomes A greater proportion of subjects treated with SOTYKTU compared to placebo achieved Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary ( PSSD ) symptom score of 0 ( absence of itch , pain , burning , stinging , and skin tightness ) at Week 16 ( 8 % in SOTYKTU vs . 1 % in placebo ) in both trials .
