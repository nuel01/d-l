Dear Medical Professional , Per your order , we have compounded Glucoheptonate as a sterile freeze - dried mixture .
The characteristics of this preparation are DESCRIPTION AnazaoHealth supplies compounded Glucoheptonate for the preparation of Tc 99 m Glucoheptonate .
Each vial contains 50 mg calcium glucoheptonate and 0 . 6 mg tin metal as stannous chloride .
The vial is back filled with inert gas and may contain a partial vacuum .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When injected intravenously , Technetium Tc 99 m Glucoheptonate is rapidly cleared from the blood .
In patients with normal renal function , less than 15 % of the initial activity remains in the blood after one hour .
About 40 % of the injected dose is excreted in the urine in one hour , while about 70 % is excreted in 24 hours .
In patients with renal disease , the blood clearance and urinary excretion of the radiopharmaceutical are delayed .
Up to 15 % of the injected dose is retained in the kidneys .
The renal retention is greater in the cortex than in the medulla .
The radiopharmaceutical may be bound to the proximal convoluted tubules , which are located primarily in the renal cortex .
Technetium Tc 99 m Glucoheptonate tends to accumulate in intracranial lesions that are associated with excessive neovascularity or an altered blood - brain barrier .
The drug does not accumulate in the choroid plexus or salivary glands .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tc 99 m Glucoheptonate may be used to image the kidney and brain and to assess renal and brain perfusion .
PREPARATION Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Glucoheptonate is done by the following aseptic procedure : • Waterproof gloves should be worn during the preparation procedure .
• Snap off the plastic lid and place room temperature reaction vial in an appropriate lead shield .
• Swab the rubber closure of the vial with a germicide .
• Inject 1 - 5 ml sterile , additive free sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection containing up to 5 , 920 MBq ( 160 mCi ) into the vial .
Be sure to maintain inert atmosphere in vial by introducing as little air as possible during reconstitution .
NOTE : If sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection must be diluted , use only preservative free Sodium Chloride Injection USP .
• Secure the lead shield cover .
Swirl the vial gently to mix contents and let stand 3 to 5 minutes prior to use .
• Record the date and time of preparation on a pressure - sensitive label .
• Affix pressure - sensitive label to shield .
• Examine vial contents ; if the solution is not clear and free of particulate matter and / or discoloration on visual inspection , it should not be used .
• Measure the radioactivity by suitable calibration system and record prior to patient administration .
• Appropriate quality control is recommended .
• Injection should be administered within 12 hours of preparation .
Storage and Handling • This preparation should be stored at room temperature before and after reconstitution .
