( 5 . 5 , 17 ) • Nervous system symptoms ( NSS ) : NSS are frequent and usually begin 1 to 2 days after initiating therapy and resolve in 2 to 4 weeks .
Dosing at bedtime may improve tolerability .
NSS are not predictive of onset of psychiatric symptoms .
( 5 . 6 , 6 . 1 , 17 ) • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Avoid administration in the first trimester of pregnancy as fetal harm may occur .
( 5 . 7 , 8 . 1 ) • Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests before and during treatment in patients with underlying hepatic disease , including hepatitis B or C coinfection , marked transaminase elevations , or who are taking medications associated with liver toxicity .
Among reported cases of hepatic failure , a few occurred in patients with no pre - existing hepatic disease .
( 5 . 9 , 6 . 1 , 8 . 6 ) • Rash : Rash usually begins within 1 to 2 weeks after initiating therapy and resolves within 4 weeks .
Discontinue if severe rash develops .
( 5 . 8 , 6 . 1 , 17 ) • Convulsions : Use caution in patients with a history of seizures .
( 5 . 10 ) • Lipids : Total cholesterol and triglyceride elevations .
Monitor before therapy and periodically thereafter .
( 5 . 11 ) • Immune reconstitution syndrome : May necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
( 5 . 12 ) • Redistribution / accumulation of body fat : Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy .
( 5 . 13 , 17 ) 5 . 1 Drug Interactions Efavirenz plasma concentrations may be altered by substrates , inhibitors , or inducers of CYP3A .
Likewise , efavirenz may alter plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2B6 .
The most prominent effect of efavirenz at steady - state is induction of CYP3A and CYP2B6 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 QTc Prolongation QTc prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 , 7 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Consider alternatives to efavirenz tablets when coadministered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes or when administered to patients at higher risk of Torsade de Pointes .
5 . 3 Resistance Efavirenz tablets must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV - 1 infection or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen .
Resistant virus emerges rapidly when efavirenz is administered as monotherapy .
The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with efavirenz should take into consideration the potential for viral cross - resistance .
5 . 4 Coadministration with Related Products Coadministration of efavirenz tablets with ATRIPLA ( efavirenz 600 mg / emtricitabine 200 mg / tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg ) is not recommended unless needed for dose adjustment ( eg , with rifampin ) , since efavirenz is one of its active ingredients .
5 . 5 Psychiatric Symptoms Serious psychiatric adverse experiences have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz tablets .
In controlled trials of 1 , 008 patients treated with regimens containing efavirenz tablets for a mean of 2 . 1 years and 635 patients treated with control regimens for a mean of 1 . 5 years , the frequency ( regardless of causality ) of specific serious psychiatric events among patients who received efavirenz tablets or control regimens , respectively , were severe depression ( 2 . 4 % , 0 . 9 % ) , suicidal ideation ( 0 . 7 % , 0 . 3 % ) , nonfatal suicide attempts ( 0 . 5 % , 0 ) , aggressive behavior ( 0 . 4 % , 0 . 5 % ) , paranoid reactions ( 0 . 4 % , 0 . 3 % ) , and manic reactions ( 0 . 2 % , 0 . 3 % ) .
When psychiatric symptoms similar to those noted above were combined and evaluated as a group in a multifactorial analysis of data from Study 006 , treatment with efavirenz was associated with an increase in the occurrence of these selected psychiatric symptoms .
Other factors associated with an increase in the occurrence of these psychiatric symptoms were history of injection drug use , psychiatric history , and receipt of psychiatric medication at study entry ; similar associations were observed in both the efavirenz tablets and control treatment groups .
In Study 006 , onset of new serious psychiatric symptoms occurred throughout the study for both efavirenz tablets - treated and control - treated patients .
One percent of efavirenz tablets - treated patients discontinued or interrupted treatment because of one or more of these selected psychiatric symptoms .
There have also been occasional postmarketing reports of death by suicide , delusions , and psychosis - like behavior although a causal relationship to the use of efavirenz tablets cannot be determined from these reports .
Postmarketing cases of catatonia have also been reported and may be associated with increased efavirenz exposure .
Patients with serious psychiatric adverse experiences should seek immediate medical evaluation to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz tablets , and if so , to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 6 Nervous System Symptoms Fifty - three percent ( 531 / 1 , 008 ) of patients receiving efavirenz tablets in controlled trials reported central nervous system symptoms ( any grade , regardless of causality ) compared to 25 % ( 156 / 635 ) of patients receiving control regimens .
These symptoms included , but were not limited to , dizziness ( 28 . 1 % of the 1 , 008 patients ) , insomnia ( 16 . 3 % ) , impaired concentration ( 8 . 3 % ) , somnolence ( 7 . 0 % ) , abnormal dreams ( 6 . 2 % ) , and hallucinations ( 1 . 2 % ) .
These symptoms were severe in 2 . 0 % of patients ; and 2 . 1 % of patients discontinued therapy as a result .
These symptoms usually begin during the first or second day of therapy and generally resolve after the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy .
After 4 weeks of therapy , the prevalence of nervous system symptoms of at least moderate severity ranged from 5 % to 9 % in patients treated with regimens containing efavirenz tablets and from 3 % to 5 % in patients treated with a control regimen .
Patients should be informed that these common symptoms were likely to improve with continued therapy and were not predictive of subsequent onset of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms .

Analysis of long - term data from Study 006 ( median follow - up 180 weeks , 102 weeks , and 76 weeks for patients treated with efavirenz tablets + zidovudine + lamivudine , efavirenz tablets + indinavir , and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine , respectively ) showed that , beyond 24 weeks of therapy , the incidences of new - onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz tablets - treated patients were generally similar to those in the indinavir - containing control arm . Analysis of long - term data from Study 006 ( median follow - up 180 weeks , 102 weeks , and 76 weeks for patients treated with efavirenz tablets + zidovudine + lamivudine , efavirenz tablets + indinavir , and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine , respectively ) showed that , beyond 24 weeks of therapy , the incidences of new - onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz tablets - treated patients were generally similar to those in the indinavir - containing control arm .
Late - onset neurotoxicity , including ataxia and encephalopathy ( impaired consciousness , confusion , psychomotor slowing , psychosis , delirium ) , may occur months to years after beginning efavirenz therapy .
Some events of late - onset neurotoxicity have occurred in patients with CYP2B6 genetic polymorphisms which are associated with increased efavirenz levels despite standard dosing of efavirenz tablets .
Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of serious neurologic adverse experiences should be evaluated promptly to assess the possibility that these events may be related to efavirenz use , and whether discontinuation of efavirenz tablets is warranted .
Patients receiving efavirenz tablets should be alerted to the potential for additive central nervous system effects when efavirenz tablets are used concomitantly with alcohol or psychoactive drugs . Patients receiving efavirenz tablets should be alerted to the potential for additive central nervous system effects when efavirenz tablets are used concomitantly with alcohol or psychoactive drugs .
Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms such as dizziness , impaired concentration , and / or drowsiness should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery . Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms such as dizziness , impaired concentration , and / or drowsiness should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery .
5 . 7 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Efavirenz may cause fetal harm when administered during the first trimester to a pregnant woman .
Advise females of reproductive potential who are receiving efavirenz tablets to avoid pregnancy .
[ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 and 8 . 3 ) . ]
5 . 8 Rash In controlled clinical trials , 26 % ( 266 / 1 , 008 ) of adult patients treated with 600 mg efavirenz tablets experienced new - onset skin rash compared with 17 % ( 111 / 635 ) of those treated in control groups [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Rash associated with blistering , moist desquamation , or ulceration occurred in 0 . 9 % ( 9 / 1 , 008 ) of patients treated with efavirenz tablets .
The incidence of Grade 4 rash ( eg , erythema multiforme , Stevens - Johnson syndrome ) in adult patients treated with efavirenz tablets in all studies and expanded access was 0 . 1 % .
Rashes are usually mild - to - moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 2 weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz ( median time to onset of rash in adults was 11 days ) and , in most patients continuing therapy with efavirenz , rash resolves within 1 month ( median duration , 16 days ) .
The discontinuation rate for rash in adult clinical trials was 1 . 7 % ( 17 / 1 , 008 ) .
Rash was reported in 59 of 182 pediatric patients ( 32 % ) treated with efavirenz tablets [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Two pediatric patients experienced Grade 3 rash ( confluent rash with fever , generalized rash ) , and four patients had Grade 4 rash ( erythema multiforme ) .
The median time to onset of rash in pediatric patients was 28 days ( range 3 to 1 , 642 days ) .
Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines before initiating therapy with efavirenz tablets in pediatric patients should be considered .
Efavirenz tablets can generally be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash .
Efavirenz tablets should be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with blistering , desquamation , mucosal involvement , or fever .
Appropriate antihistamines and / or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash .
For patients who have had a life - threatening cutaneous reaction ( eg , Stevens - Johnson syndrome ) , alternative therapy should be considered [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 9 Hepatotoxicity Postmarketing cases of hepatitis , including fulminant hepatitis progressing to liver failure requiring transplantation or resulting in death , have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz .
Reports have included patients with underlying hepatic disease , including coinfection with hepatitis B or C , and patients without pre - existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors .
Efavirenz is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
Careful monitoring is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment receiving efavirenz .
[ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Monitoring of liver enzymes before and during treatment is recommended for all patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Consider discontinuing efavirenz in patients with persistent elevations of serum transaminases to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range .
Discontinue efavirenz if elevation of serum transaminases is accompanied by clinical signs or symptoms of hepatitis or hepatic decompensation .
5 . 10 Convulsions Convulsions have been observed in adult and pediatric patients receiving efavirenz , generally in the presence of known medical history of seizures [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
Caution should be taken in any patient with a history of seizures .
Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medications primarily metabolized by the liver , such as phenytoin and phenobarbital , may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 11 Lipid Elevations Treatment with efavirenz tablets has resulted in increases in the concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Cholesterol and triglyceride testing should be performed before initiating efavirenz tablets therapy and at periodic intervals during therapy .
5 . 12 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including efavirenz tablets .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as infection , cytomegalovirus , pneumonia [ PCP ] , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including efavirenz tablets .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [ PCP ] , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ’ disease , polymyositis , Guillain - Barré syndrome , and autoimmune hepatitis ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 13 Fat Redistribution Redistribution / accumulation of body fat including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( buffalo hump ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and " cushingoid appearance " have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy .
The mechanism and long - term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
A causal relationship has not been established .

Psychiatric Symptoms Serious psychiatric adverse experiences have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz tablets .
In controlled trials , psychiatric symptoms observed at a frequency greater than 2 % among patients treated with efavirenz tablets or control regimens , respectively , were depression ( 19 % , 16 % ) , anxiety ( 13 % , 9 % ) , and nervousness ( 7 % , 2 % ) .
Rash In controlled clinical trials , the frequency of rash ( all grades , regardless of causality ) was 26 % for 1 , 008 adults treated with regimens containing efavirenz tablets and 17 % for 635 adults treated with a control regimen .
Most reports of rash were mild or moderate in severity .
The frequency of Grade 3 rash was 0 . 8 % for efavirenz tablets - treated patients and 0 . 3 % for control groups , and the frequency of Grade 4 rash was 0 . 1 % for efavirenz tablets and 0 for control groups .
The discontinuation rates as a result of rash were 1 . 7 % for efavirenz tablets - treated patients and 0 . 3 % for control groups [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
Experience with efavirenz tablets in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class is limited .
Nineteen patients who discontinued nevirapine because of rash have been treated with efavirenz tablets .
Nine of these patients developed mild - to - moderate rash while receiving therapy with efavirenz tablets , and two of these patients discontinued because of rash .
Laboratory Abnormalities Selected Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities reported in ≥ 2 % of efavirenz tablets - treated patients in two clinical trials are presented in Table 4 .

d Nonfasting .
ZDV = zidovudine , LAM = lamivudine , ULN = upper limit of normal , ALT = alanine aminotransferase , AST = aspartate aminotransferase , GGT = gamma - glutamyltransferase .
Patients Coinfected with Hepatitis B or C Liver function tests should be monitored in patients with a history of hepatitis B and / or C .
In the long - term data set from Study 006 , 137 patients treated with efavirenz tablets - containing regimens ( median duration of therapy , 68 weeks ) and 84 treated with a control regimen ( median duration , 56 weeks ) were seropositive at screening for hepatitis B ( surface antigen positive ) and / or C ( hepatitis C antibody positive ) .
Among these coinfected patients , elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13 % of patients in the efavirenz tablets arms and 7 % of those in the control arm , and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN developed in 20 % of patients in the efavirenz tablets arms and 7 % of patients in the control arm .
Among coinfected patients , 3 % of those treated with efavirenz tablets - containing regimens and 2 % in the control arm discontinued from the study because of liver or biliary system disorders [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
Lipids Increases from baseline in total cholesterol of 10 to 20 % have been observed in some uninfected volunteers receiving efavirenz .
In patients treated with efavirenz tablets + zidovudine + lamivudine , increases from baseline in nonfasting total cholesterol and HDL of approximately 20 % and 25 % , respectively , were observed .
In patients treated with efavirenz tablets + indinavir , increases from baseline in nonfasting cholesterol and HDL of approximately 40 % and 35 % , respectively , were observed .
Nonfasting total cholesterol levels 240 mg / dL and 300 mg / dL were reported in 34 % and 9 % , respectively , of patients treated with efavirenz tablets + zidovudine + lamivudine ; 54 % and 20 % , respectively , of patients treated with efavirenz tablets + indinavir ; and 28 % and 4 % , respectively , of patients treated with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine .
The effects of efavirenz tablets on triglycerides and LDL in this study were not well characterized since samples were taken from nonfasting patients .
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] .
Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , the adverse reaction rates reported cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical studies and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Assessment of adverse reactions is based on three clinical trials in 182 HIV - 1 infected pediatric patients ( 3 months to 21 years of age ) who received efavirenz tablets in combination with other antiretroviral agents for a median of 123 weeks .
The adverse reactions observed in the three trials were similar to those observed in clinical trials in adults except that rash was more common in pediatric patients ( 32 % for all grades regardless of causality ) and more often of higher grade ( ie , more severe ) .
Two ( 1 . 1 % ) pediatric patients experienced Grade 3 rash ( confluent rash with fever , generalized rash ) , and four ( 2 . 2 % ) pediatric patients had Grade 4 rash ( all erythema multiforme ) .
Five pediatric patients ( 2 . 7 % ) discontinued from the study because of rash [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of efavirenz tablets .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Body as a Whole : allergic reactions , asthenia , redistribution / accumulation of body fat [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) ] Central and Peripheral Nervous System : abnormal coordination , ataxia , encephalopathy , cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances , convulsions , hypoesthesia , paresthesia , neuropathy , tremor , vertigo Endocrine : gynecomastia Gastrointestinal : constipation , malabsorption Cardiovascular : flushing , palpitations Liver and Biliary System : hepatic enzyme increase , hepatic failure , hepatitis .
Metabolic and Nutritional : hypercholesterolemia , hypertriglyceridemia .
Musculoskeletal : arthralgia , myalgia , myopathy Psychiatric : aggressive reactions , agitation , delusions , emotional lability , mania , neurosis , paranoia , psychosis , suicide , catatonia Respiratory : dyspnea Skin and Appendages : erythema multiforme , photoallergic dermatitis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome Special Senses : abnormal vision , tinnitus 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Coadministration of efavirenz can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of efavirenz .
The potential for drug - drug interactions should be considered before and during therapy .
( 7 ) 7 . 1 Potential for Efavirenz to Affect other Drugs Efavirenz has been shown in vivo to induce CYP3A and CYP2B6 .
Other compounds that are substrates of CYP3A or CYP2B6 may have decreased plasma concentrations when coadministered with efavirenz tablets .
7 . 2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Efavirenz Drugs that induce CYP3A activity ( eg , phenobarbital , rifampin , rifabutin ) would be expected to increase the clearance of efavirenz resulting in lowered plasma concentrations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
7 . 3 QT Prolonging Drugs There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between efavirenz and drugs that prolong the QTc interval .
QTc prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Consider alternatives to efavirenz when coadministered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes .
7 . 4 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Drug interactions with efavirenz tablets are summarized in Table 5 .
For pharmacokinetics data , [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] Tables 7 and 8 .

This table is not all - inclusive .
7 . 5 Drugs Without Clinically Significant Interactions with Efavirenz No dosage adjustment is recommended when efavirenz is given with the following : aluminum / magnesium hydroxide antacids , azithromycin , cetirizine , famotidine , fluconazole , lorazepam , nelfinavir , nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( abacavir , emtricitabine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , zidovudine ) , paroxetine , and raltegravir .
7 . 6 Cannabinoid Test Interaction Efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors .
False - positive urine cannabinoid test results have been reported with some screening assays in uninfected and HIV - infected subjects receiving efavirenz .
Confirmation of positive screening tests for cannabinoids by a more specific method is recommended .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended .
( 8 . 2 ) • Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Pregnancy testing and contraception are recommended .
( 8 . 3 ) • Hepatic impairment : Efavirenz tablets are not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
Use caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment .
( 8 . 6 ) • Pediatric patients : The incidence of rash was higher than in adults .
( 5 . 8 , 6 . 2 , 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to efavirenz tablets during pregnancy .
Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary There are retrospective case reports of neural tube defects in infants whose mothers were exposed to efavirenz - containing regimens in the first trimester of pregnancy .
Prospective pregnancy data from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry are not sufficient to adequately assess this risk .
Available data from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry show no difference in the risk of overall major birth defects compared to the background rate for major birth defects of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) .
Although a causal relationship has not been established between exposure to efavirenz in the first trimester and neural tube defects , similar malformations have been observed in studies conducted in monkeys at doses similar to the human dose .
In addition , fetal and embryonic toxicities occurred in rats , at a dose ten times less than the human exposure at recommended clinical dose .
Because of the potential risk of neural tube defects , efavirenz should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Data Human Data There are retrospective postmarketing reports of findings consistent with neural tube defects , including meningomyelocele , all in infants of mothers exposed to efavirenz - containing regimens in the first trimester .
Based on prospective reports from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) of approximately 1 , 000 live births following exposure to efavirenz - containing regimens ( including over 800 live births exposed in the first trimester ) , there was no difference between efavirenz and overall birth defects compared with the background birth defect rate of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program .
As of the interim APR report issued December 2014 , the prevalence of birth defects following first - trimester exposure was 2 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 4 % to 3 . 6 % ) .
One of these prospectively reported defects with first - trimester exposure was a neural tube defect .
A single case of anophthalmia with first - trimester exposure to efavirenz has also been prospectively reported .
This case also included severe oblique facial clefts and amniotic banding , which have a known association with anophthalmia .
Animal Data Effects of efavirenz on embryo - fetal development have been studied in three nonclinical species ( cynomolgus monkeys , rats , and rabbits ) .
In monkeys , efavirenz 60 mg / kg / day was administered to pregnant females throughout pregnancy ( gestation days 20 through 150 ) .
The maternal systemic drug exposures ( AUC ) were 1 . 3 times the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose ( 600 mg / day ) , with fetal umbilical venous drug concentrations approximately 0 . 7 times the maternal values .
Three of 20 fetuses / infants had one or more malformations ; there were no malformed fetuses or infants from placebo - treated mothers .
The malformations that occurred in these three monkey fetuses included anencephaly and unilateral anophthalmia in one fetus , microphthalmia in a second , and cleft palate in the third .
There was no NOAEL ( no observable adverse effect level ) established for this study because only one dosage was evaluated .
In rats , efavirenz was administered either during organogenesis ( gestation days 7 to 18 ) or from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 at 50 , 100 , or 200 mg / kg / day .
Administration of 200 mg / kg / day in rats was associated with increase in the incidence of early resorptions ; and doses 100 mg / kg / day and greater were associated with early neonatal mortality .
The AUC at the NOAEL ( 50 mg / kg / day ) in this rat study was 0 . 1 times that in humans at the recommended clinical dose .
Drug concentrations in the milk on lactation day 10 were approximately 8 times higher than those in maternal plasma .
In pregnant rabbits , efavirenz was neither embryo lethal nor teratogenic when administered at doses of 25 , 50 , and 75 mg / kg / day over the period of organogenesis ( gestation days 6 through 18 ) .
The AUC at the NOAEL ( 75 mg / kg / day ) in rabbits was 0 . 4 times that in humans at the recommended clinical dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV .
Because of the potential for HIV transmission in breastfed infants , advise women not to breastfeed .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Because of potential teratogenic effects , pregnancy should be avoided in women receiving efavirenz tablets .
[ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) . ]
Pregnancy Testing Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of efavirenz tablets .
Contraception Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with efavirenz tablets and for 12 weeks after discontinuing efavirenz tablets due to the long half - life of efavirenz .
Barrier contraception should always be used in combination with other methods of contraception .
Hormonal methods that contain progesterone may have decreased effectiveness [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety , pharmacokinetic profile , and virologic and immunologic responses of efavirenz tablets were evaluated in antiretroviral - naive and - experienced HIV - 1 infected pediatric patients 3 months to 21 years of age in three open - label clinical trials [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The type and frequency of adverse reactions in these trials were generally similar to those of adult patients with the exception of a higher frequency of rash , including a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 rash , in pediatric patients compared to adults [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Use of efavirenz tablets in patients younger than 3 months of age OR less than 3 . 5 kg body weight is not recommended because the safety , pharmacokinetics , and antiviral activity of efavirenz tablets have not been evaluated in this age group and there is a risk of developing HIV resistance if efavirenz tablets are underdosed .
See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) for dosing recommendations for pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of efavirenz tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other therapy .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Efavirenz tablets are not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment because there are insufficient data to determine whether dose adjustment is necessary .
Patients with mild hepatic impairment may be treated with efavirenz without any adjustment in dose .
Because of the extensive cytochrome P450 - mediated metabolism of efavirenz and limited clinical experience in patients with hepatic impairment , caution should be exercised in administering efavirenz tablets to these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Some patients accidentally taking 600 mg twice daily have reported increased nervous system symptoms .
One patient experienced involuntary muscle contractions .
Treatment of overdose with efavirenz tablets should consist of general supportive measures , including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient ’ s clinical status .
Administration of activated charcoal may be used to aid removal of unabsorbed drug .
There is no specific antidote for overdose with efavirenz tablets .
Since efavirenz is highly protein bound , dialysis is unlikely to significantly remove the drug from blood .
11 DESCRIPTION Efavirenz is an HIV - 1 specific , non - nucleoside , reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) .
Efavirenz is chemically described as ( S ) - 6 - chloro - 4 - ( cyclopropylethynyl ) - 1 , 4 - dihydro - 4 - ( trifluoromethyl ) - 2 H - 3 , 1 - benzoxazin - 2 - one .
Its empirical formula is C 14 H 9 ClF 3 NO 2 and its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Efavirenz USP is a white to slightly pink crystalline powder with a molecular mass of 315 . 68 .
It is practically insoluble in water ( < 10 microgram / mL ) .
Tablets : Efavirenz is available as film - coated tablets for oral administration containing 600 mg of efavirenz USP and the following inactive ingredients : microcrystalline cellulose , sodium lauryl sulfate , croscarmellose sodium , hydroxypropyl cellulose , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate .
The film coating contains Opadry ® Yellow ( hypromellose , titanium dioxide , iron oxide yellow and polyethylene glycol ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Efavirenz is an antiviral drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of efavirenz on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open - label , positive and placebo controlled , fixed single sequence 3 - period , 3 - treatment crossover QT study in 58 healthy subjects enriched for CYP2B6 polymorphisms .
The mean C max of efavirenz in subjects with CYP2B6 * 6 / * 6 genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days was 2 . 25 - fold the mean C max observed in subjects with CYP2B6 * 1 / * 1 genotype .
A positive relationship between efavirenz concentration and QTc prolongation was observed .
Based on the concentration - QTc relationship , the mean QTc prolongation and its upper bound 90 % confidence interval are 8 . 7 ms and 11 . 3 ms in subjects with CYP2B6 * 6 / * 6 genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Peak efavirenz plasma concentrations of 1 . 6 to 9 . 1 μM were attained by 5 hours following single oral doses of 100 mg to 1 , 600 mg administered to uninfected volunteers .
Dose - related increases in C max and AUC were seen for doses up to 1 , 600 mg ; the increases were less than proportional suggesting diminished absorption at higher doses .
In HIV - 1 - infected patients at steady state , mean C max , mean C min , and mean AUC were dose proportional following 200 mg , 400 mg , and 600 mg daily doses .
Time - to - peak plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 5 hours and steady - state plasma concentrations were reached in 6 to 10 days .
In 35 patients receiving efavirenz tablets 600 mg once daily , steady - state C max was 12 . 9 ± 3 . 7 μM ( mean ± SD ) , steady - state C min was 5 . 6 ± 3 . 2 μM , and AUC was 184 ± 73 μM • h . Effect of Food on Oral Absorption : Tablets : Administration of a single 600 mg efavirenz tablet with a high - fat / high - caloric meal ( approximately 1 , 000 kcal , 500 to 600 kcal from fat ) was associated with a 28 % increase in mean AUC ∞ of efavirenz and a 79 % increase in mean C max of efavirenz relative to the exposures achieved under fasted conditions .
[ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) . ]
Distribution Efavirenz is highly bound ( approximately 99 . 5 to 99 . 75 % ) to human plasma proteins , predominantly albumin .
In HIV - 1 infected patients ( n = 9 ) who received efavirenz tablets 200 to 600 mg once daily for at least one month , cerebrospinal fluid concentrations ranged from 0 . 26 to 1 . 19 % ( mean 0 . 69 % ) of the corresponding plasma concentration .
This proportion is approximately 3 - fold higher than the non - protein - bound ( free ) fraction of efavirenz in plasma .
Metabolism Studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that efavirenz is principally metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system to hydroxylated metabolites with subsequent glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites .
These metabolites are essentially inactive against HIV - 1 .
The in vitro studies suggest that CYP3A and CYP2B6 are the major isozymes responsible for efavirenz metabolism .
Efavirenz has been shown to induce CYP enzymes , resulting in the induction of its own metabolism .
Multiple doses of 200 to 400 mg per day for 10 days resulted in a lower than predicted extent of accumulation ( 22 to 42 % lower ) and a shorter terminal half - life of 40 to 55 hours ( single dose half - life 52 to 76 hours ) .
Elimination Efavirenz has a terminal half - life of 52 to 76 hours after single doses and 40 to 55 hours after multiple doses .
A one - month mass balance / excretion study was conducted using 400 mg per day with a 14 C - labeled dose administered on Day 8 .
Approximately 14 to 34 % of the radiolabel was recovered in the urine and 16 to 61 % was recovered in the feces .
Nearly all of the urinary excretion of the radiolabeled drug was in the form of metabolites .
Efavirenz accounted for the majority of the total radioactivity measured in feces .
Special Populations Pediatric : The pharmacokinetic parameters for efavirenz at steady state in pediatric patients were predicted by a population pharmacokinetic model .
Gender and race : The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz in patients appear to be similar between men and women and among the racial groups studied .
Renal impairment : The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency ; however , less than 1 % of efavirenz is excreted unchanged in the urine , so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal .
Hepatic impairment : A multiple - dose study showed no significant effect on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A ) compared with controls .
There were insufficient data to determine whether moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B or C ) affects efavirenz pharmacokinetics .
Drug Interaction Studies Efavirenz has been shown in vivo to cause hepatic enzyme induction , thus increasing the biotransformation of some drugs metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2B6 .
In vitro studies have shown that efavirenz inhibited CYP isozymes 2C9 and 2C19 with K i values ( 8 . 5 to 17 μM ) in the range of observed efavirenz plasma concentrations .
In in vitro studies , efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 ( K i values 82 to 160 μM ) only at concentrations well above those achieved clinically .
Coadministration of efavirenz with drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP3A , or CYP2B6 isozymes may result in altered plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug .
Drugs which induce CYP3A and CYP2B6 activity would be expected to increase the clearance of efavirenz resulting in lowered plasma concentrations .
Drug interaction studies were performed with efavirenz and other drugs likely to be coadministered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction .
The effects of coadministration of efavirenz on the C max , AUC , and C min are summarized in Table 7 ( effect of efavirenz on other drugs ) and Table 8 ( effect of other drugs on efavirenz ) .

12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Efavirenz is an NNRTI of HIV - 1 .
Efavirenz activity is mediated predominantly by noncompetitive inhibition of HIV - 1 reverse transcriptase .
HIV - 2 reverse transcriptase and human cellular DNA polymerases α , β , γ , and δ are not inhibited by efavirenz .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture The concentration of efavirenz inhibiting replication of wild - type laboratory adapted strains and clinical isolates in cell culture by 90 to 95 % ( EC 90 to95 ) ranged from 1 . 7 to 25 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines , peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) , and macrophage / monocyte cultures .
Efavirenz demonstrated antiviral activity against clade B and most non - clade B isolates ( subtypes A , AE , AG , C , D , F , G , J , N ) , but had reduced antiviral activity against group O viruses .
Efavirenz demonstrated additive antiviral activity without cytotoxicity against HIV - 1 in cell culture when combined with the NNRTIs delavirdine and nevirapine , NRTIs ( abacavir , didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , zalcitabine , zidovudine ) , PIs ( amprenavir , indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir ) , and the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide .
Efavirenz demonstrated additive to antagonistic antiviral activity in cell culture with atazanavir .
Efavirenz was not antagonistic with adefovir , used for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infection , or ribavirin , used in combination with interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection .
Resistance In cell culture In cell culture , HIV - 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to efavirenz ( > 380 - fold increase in EC 90 value ) emerged rapidly in the presence of drug .
Genotypic characterization of these viruses identified single amino acid substitutions L100I or V179D , double substitutions L100I / V108I , and triple substitutions L100I / V179D / Y181C in reverse transcriptase .
Clinical studies Clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility in cell culture to efavirenz have been obtained .
One or more substitutions at amino acid positions 98 , 100 , 101 , 103 , 106 , 108 , 188 , 190 , 225 , and 227 in reverse transcriptase were observed in patients failing treatment with efavirenz in combination with indinavir , or with zidovudine plus lamivudine .
The K103N substitution was the most frequently observed .
Long - term resistance surveillance ( average 52 weeks , range 4 to 106 weeks ) analyzed 28 matching baseline and virologic failure isolates .
Sixty - one percent ( 17 / 28 ) of these failure isolates had decreased efavirenz susceptibility in cell culture with a median 88 - fold change in efavirenz susceptibility ( EC 50 value ) from reference .
The most frequent NNRTI substitution to develop in these patient isolates was K103N ( 54 % ) .
Other NNRTI substitutions that developed included L100I ( 7 % ) , K101E / Q / R ( 14 % ) , V108I ( 11 % ) , G190S / T / A ( 7 % ) , P225H ( 18 % ) , and M230I / L ( 11 % ) .
Cross - Resistance Cross - resistance among NNRTIs has been observed .
Clinical isolates previously characterized as efavirenz - resistant were also phenotypically resistant in cell culture to delavirdine and nevirapine compared to baseline .
Delavirdine - and / or nevirapine - resistant clinical viral isolates with NNRTI resistance - associated substitutions ( A98G , L100I , K101E / P , K103N / S , V106A , Y181X , Y188X , G190X , P225H , F227L , or M230L ) showed reduced susceptibility to efavirenz in cell culture .
Greater than 90 % of NRTI - resistant clinical isolates tested in cell culture retained susceptibility to efavirenz .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were carried out with efavirenz .
Mice were dosed with 0 , 25 , 75 , 150 , or 300 mg / kg / day for 2 years .
Incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas and pulmonary alveolar / bronchiolar adenomas were increased above background in females .
No increases in tumor incidence above background were seen in males .
There was no NOAEL in females established for this study because tumor findings occurred at all doses .
AUC at the NOAEL ( 150 mg / kg ) in the males was approximately 0 . 9 times that in humans at the recommended clinical dose .
In the rat study , no increases in tumor incidence were observed at doses up to 100 mg / kg / day , for which AUCs were 0 . 1 ( males ) or 0 . 2 ( females ) times those in humans at the recommended clinical dose .
Mutagenesis Efavirenz tested negative in a battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays .
These included bacterial mutation assays in S . typhimurium and E . coli , mammalian mutation assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells , chromosome aberration assays in human peripheral blood lymphocytes or Chinese hamster ovary cells , and an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility Efavirenz did not impair mating or fertility of male or female rats , and did not affect sperm of treated male rats .
The reproductive performance of offspring born to female rats given efavirenz was not affected .
The AUCs at the NOAEL values in male ( 200 mg / kg ) and female ( 100 mg / kg ) rats were approximately ≤ 0 . 15 times that in humans at the recommended clinical dose .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology Nonsustained convulsions were observed in 6 of 20 monkeys receiving efavirenz at doses yielding plasma AUC values 4 - to 13 - fold greater than those in humans given the recommended dose [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Adults Study 006 , a randomized , open - label trial , compared efavirenz tablets ( 600 mg once daily ) + zidovudine ( ZDV , 300 mg q12h ) + lamivudine ( LAM , 150 mg q12h ) or efavirenz tablets ( 600 mg once daily ) + indinavir ( IDV , 1 , 000 mg q8h ) with indinavir ( 800 mg q8h ) + zidovudine ( 300 mg q12h ) + lamivudine ( 150 mg q12h ) .
Twelve hundred sixty - six patients ( mean age 36 . 5 years [ range 18 to 81 ] , 60 % Caucasian , 83 % male ) were enrolled .
All patients were efavirenz - , lamivudine - , NNRTI - , and PI - naive at study entry .
The median baseline CD4 + cell count was 320 cells / mm 3 and the median baseline HIV - 1 RNA level was 4 . 8 log 10 copies / mL .
Treatment outcomes with standard assay ( assay limit 400 copies / mL ) through 48 and 168 weeks are shown in Table 9 .
Plasma HIV RNA levels were quantified with standard ( assay limit 400 copies / mL ) and ultrasensitive ( assay limit 50 copies / mL ) versions of the AMPLICOR HIV - 1 MONITOR assay .
During the study , version 1 . 5 of the assay was introduced in Europe to enhance detection of non - clade B virus .

c Includes consent withdrawn , lost to follow - up , noncompliance , never treated , missing data , protocol violation , death , and other reasons .
Patients with HIV - 1 RNA levels < 400 copies / mL who chose not to continue in the voluntary extension phases of the study were censored at date of last dose of study medication .
For patients treated with efavirenz tablets + zidovudine + lamivudine , efavirenz tablets + indinavir , or indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine , the percentage of responders with HIV - 1 RNA < 50 copies / mL was 65 % , 50 % , and 45 % , respectively , through 48 weeks , and 43 % , 31 % , and 23 % , respectively , through 168 weeks .
A Kaplan - Meier analysis of time to loss of virologic response ( HIV RNA < 400 copies / mL ) suggests that both the trends of virologic response and differences in response continue through 4 years .
ACTG 364 is a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , 48 - week study in NRTI - experienced patients who had completed two prior ACTG studies .
One - hundred ninety - six patients ( mean age 41 years [ range 18 to 76 ] , 74 % Caucasian , 88 % male ) received NRTIs in combination with efavirenz tablets ( 600 mg once daily ) , or nelfinavir ( NFV , 750 mg three times daily ) , or efavirenz tablets ( 600 mg once daily ) + nelfinavir in a randomized , double - blinded manner .
The mean baseline CD4 + cell count was 389 cells / mm3 and mean baseline HIV - 1 RNA level was 8 , 130 copies / mL .
Upon entry into the study , all patients were assigned a new open - label NRTI regimen , which was dependent on their previous NRTI treatment experience .
There was no significant difference in the mean CD4 + cell count among treatment groups ; the overall mean increase was approximately 100 cells at 48 weeks among patients who continued on study regimens .
Treatment outcomes are shown in Table 10 .
Plasma HIV RNA levels were quantified with the AMPLICOR HIV - 1 MONITOR assay using a lower limit of quantification of 500 copies / mL .

For more information , see the section “ What should I tell my doctor before taking efavirenz tablets ? ”
Read this Patient Information before you start taking efavirenz tablets and each time you get a refill .
There may be new information .
This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or treatment .
What are efavirenz tablets ?
Efavirenz tablets are a prescription HIV - 1 ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 ) medicine used with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV - 1 infection in adults and in children who are at least 3 months old and who weigh at least 7 pounds 12 ounces ( 3 . 5 kg ) .
HIV is the virus that causes AIDS ( Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ) .
It is not known if efavirenz tablets are safe and effective in children younger than 3 months of age or who weigh less than 7 pounds 12 ounces ( 3 . 5 kg ) .
When used with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV - 1 infection , efavirenz tablets may help : • reduce the amount of HIV - 1 in your blood .
This is called viral load .
• increase the number of CD4 + ( T ) cells in your blood that help fight off other infections .
Reducing the amount of HIV - 1 and increasing the CD4 + ( T ) cells in your blood may help improve your immune system .
This may reduce your risk of death or getting infections that can happen when your immune system is weak ( opportunistic infections ) .
Efavirenz tablets does not cure HIV - 1 infection or AIDS .
You should keep taking HIV - 1 medicines to control HIV - 1 infection and decrease HIV - related illnesses .
Avoid doing things that can spread HIV - 1 infection to others : • Do not share or reuse needles or other injection equipment .
• Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them , like toothbrushes and razor blades .
• Do not have any kind of sex without protection .
