Pulmonary involvement can occur in isolation or as part of a systemic reaction .
Dichlorphenamide should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of immune - mediated or other life - threatening adverse reaction .
5 . 2 Concomitant Use of Aspirin or Other Salicylates Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors , including dichlorphenamide , can cause metabolic acidosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] , which can increase the risk of salicylate toxicity .
Anorexia , tachypnea , lethargy , and coma have been reported with concomitant use of dichlorphenamide and high - dose aspirin .
Therefore , the concomitant use of dichlorphenamide and high - dose aspirin is contraindicated .
Patients with concomitant use of dichlorphenamide and low - dose aspirin should be carefully monitored .
5 . 3 Hypokalemia Dichlorphenamide increases potassium excretion and can cause hypokalemia .
The risk of hypokalemia is greater when dichlorphenamide is used in patients with conditions associated with hypokalemia ( e . g . , adrenocortical excess , renal tubular acidosis type 1 and 2 ) , and in patients receiving other drugs that may cause hypokalemia [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ] .
Baseline and periodic measurements of serum potassium during dichlorphenamide treatment is recommended .
If hypokalemia develops or persists , consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing dichlorphenamide and correction of potassium levels .
5 . 4 Metabolic Acidosis Dichlorphenamide can cause hyperchloremic non - anion gap metabolic acidosis .
Concomitant use of dichlorphenamide with other drugs that cause metabolic acidosis may increase the severity of acidosis .
Concomitant use of dichlorphenamide in compensated patients with respiratory acidosis , such as in advanced lung diseases , may lead to respiratory decompensation .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of dichlorphenamide .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following are adverse reactions which have been reported during postapproval use of dichlorphenamide and were serious or are not reported in the previous section of labeling [ see Clinical Trials Experience ( 6 . 1 ) ] : amnesia , cardiac failure , condition aggravated , convulsion , hallucination , nephrolithiasis , pancytopenia , psychotic disorder , renal tubular necrosis , stupor , syncope , tremor .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Aspirin : anorexia , tachypnea , lethargy , and coma have been reported with concomitant use of dichlorphenamide and high - dose aspirin .
The concomitant use of dichlorphenamide tablets and high - dose aspirin is contraindicated .
Dichlorphenamide tablets should be used with caution in patients receiving lower doses of aspirin ( 4 , 5 . 2 , 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Aspirin and Other Salicylates Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors , including dichlorphenamide , can cause metabolic acidosis [ see Warning and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 4 ) ] , which can increase the risk of salicylate toxicity .
Anorexia , tachypnea , lethargy , and coma have been reported with concomitant use of dichlorphenamide and high - dose aspirin .
Therefore , concomitant use of dichlorphenamide and high - dose aspirin is contraindicated .
Patients with concomitant use of dichlorphenamide and low - dose aspirin should be carefully monitored [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
7 . 2 Drugs that are Substrates of Organic Anion Transporter1 ( OAT1 ) In vitro , dichlorphenamide is an inhibitor of OAT1 transporters .
The concomitant administration of dichlorphenamide may increase the plasma exposures of OAT1 substrates .
Use of dichlorphenamide with drugs that are sensitive to OAT1 inhibition ( e . g . , methotrexate , famotidine , oseltamivir ) is not recommended [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Drugs that Cause Hypokalemia The risk of hypokalemia is greater with coadministration of dichlorphenamide and other drugs that can cause hypokalemia ( e . g . , loop diuretics , thiazide diuretics , laxatives , antifungals , penicillins , and theophylline ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 4 Drugs that Cause Metabolic Acidosis Coadministration of dichlorphenamide and other drugs that can cause metabolic acidosis may increase the severity of the acidosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
7 . 5 Drugs that are Inhibitors of OAT1 or OAT3 An in vitro transporter study indicated that dichlorphenamide is a substrate of human transporters OAT1 and OAT3 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Therefore , signs of dichlorphenamide toxicity should be monitored when administered with OAT1 or OAT3 inhibitors .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm ( 8 . 1 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of dichlorphenamide in pregnant women .
A no - effect dose has not been established .
Dichlorphenamide was teratogenic when administered orally to pregnant rats .
