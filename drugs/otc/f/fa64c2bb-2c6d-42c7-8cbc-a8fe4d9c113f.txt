WARNING : EMBRYO - FETAL TOXICITY AND VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM WARNING : EMBRYO - FETAL TOXICITY AND VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning .
EMBRYO - FETAL TOXICITY • • If THALOMID is taken during pregnancy , it can cause severe birth defects or embryo - fetal death .
THALOMID should never be used by females who are pregnant or who could be pregnant while taking the drug .
Even a single dose [ 1 capsule ( regardless of strength ) ] taken by a pregnant woman during her pregnancy can cause severe birth defects .
• • Pregnancy must be excluded before start of treatment .
Prevent pregnancy thereafter by the use of two reliable methods of contraception .
( 5 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) THALOMID is only available through a restricted distribution program , the THALOMID REMS ® program ( 5 . 2 ) .
VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM • • Significant increased risk of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and pulmonary embolism ( PE ) in patients with multiple myeloma receiving THALOMID with dexamethasone ( 5 . 3 ) .
EMBRYO - FETAL TOXICITY If THALOMID is taken during pregnancy , it can cause severe birth defects or embryo - fetal death .
THALOMID should never be used by females who are pregnant or who could become pregnant while taking the drug .
Even a single dose [ 1 capsule ( regardless of strength ) ] taken by a pregnant woman during her pregnancy can cause severe birth defects .
Because of this toxicity and in an effort to make the chance of embryo - fetal exposure to THALOMID as negligible as possible , THALOMID is approved for marketing only through a special restricted distribution program : THALOMID REMS program , approved by the Food and Drug Administration .
Information about THALOMID and the THALOMID REMS program is available at www . thalomidrems . com or by calling the REMS Call Center at 1 - 888 - 423 - 5436 .
VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM The use of THALOMID in multiple myeloma results in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism , such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism .
This risk increases significantly when THALOMID is used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents including dexamethasone .
In one controlled trial , the rate of venous thromboembolism was 22 . 5 % in patients receiving THALOMID in combination with dexamethasone compared to 4 . 9 % in patients receiving dexamethasone alone ( p = 0 . 002 ) .
Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism .
Instruct patients to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath , chest pain , or arm or leg swelling .
Consider thromboprophylaxis based on an assessment of individual patients ' underlying risk factors .
1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE • • THALOMID in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ( MM ) .

THALOMID can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
THALOMID is a powerful human teratogen , inducing a high frequency of severe and life - threatening birth defects , even after a single dose [ see Boxed Warning ] .
Mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40 % of infants .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus .
If pregnancy occurs during THALOMID treatment , the drug should be discontinued immediately .
4 . 2 Hypersensitivity THALOMID is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its components [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 16 ) ] .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Ischemic heart disease ( including myocardial infarction ) and stroke have been observed in patients treated with THALOMID in combination with dexamethasone .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Increased Mortality : Observed in patients with MM when pembrolizumab was added to dexamethasone and a thalidomide analogue .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Drowsiness and Somnolence : Instruct patients to avoid situations where drowsiness may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause drowsiness .
( 5 . 5 ) • • Peripheral Neuropathy : Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy during treatment .
Discontinue THALOMID if symptoms of drug - induced peripheral neuropathy occur , if clinically appropriate .
( 5 . 6 ) • • Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension : Advise patients to sit upright for a few minutes prior to standing up from a recumbent position .

Discontinue THALOMID for angioedema and anaphylaxis .
( 5 . 16 ) 5 . 1 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity THALOMID is a powerful human teratogen that induces a high frequency of severe and life - threatening birth defects , even after a single dose .
Mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40 % of infants .
When there is no satisfactory alternative treatment , females of reproductive potential may be treated with THALOMID provided adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy .
THALOMID is only available through the THALOMID REMS program [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Oral ingestion is the only type of maternal THALOMID exposure known to result in drug - associated birth defects .
There are no specific data available regarding the reproductive risks of cutaneous absorption or inhalation of THALOMID ; however , females of reproductive potential should avoid contact with THALOMID Capsules .
THALOMID Capsules should be stored in blister packs until ingestion .
If there is contact with non - intact THALOMID capsules or the powder contents , the exposed area should be washed with soap and water .
If healthcare providers or other care givers are exposed to body fluids from patients receiving THALOMID , the exposed area should be washed with soap and water .
Appropriate precautions should be utilized , such as wearing gloves to prevent the potential cutaneous exposure to THALOMID .
Females of Reproductive Potential Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning THALOMID therapy , during therapy , during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy .
Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control , beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with THALOMID , during therapy , during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of THALOMID therapy .
Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy .
The first test should be performed within 10 - 14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing THALOMID therapy and then weekly during the first month , then monthly thereafter in females with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in females with irregular menstrual cycles [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
Males Thalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving THALOMID .
Therefore , males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking THALOMID and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing THALOMID , even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy .
Male patients taking THALOMID must not donate sperm [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
Blood Donation Patients must not donate blood during treatment with THALOMID and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to THALOMID .
5 . 2 THALOMID REMS Program Because of the embryo - fetal risk [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] , THALOMID is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) , the THALOMID REMS program .
Required components of the THALOMID REMS program include the following : • • Prescribers must be certified with the THALOMID REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements .
• • Patients must sign a Patient - Physician Agreement Form and comply with the REMS requirements .
In particular , female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] and males must comply with contraception requirements [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
• • Pharmacies must be certified with the THALOMID REMS program , must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive THALOMID and comply with REMS requirements .
Further information about the THALOMID REMS program is available at www . thalomidrems . com or by telephone at 1 - 888 - 423 - 5436 .
5 . 3 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism The use of THALOMID in patients with MM results in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism , such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism .
This risk increases significantly when THALOMID is used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents including dexamethasone .
In one controlled trial , the rate of venous thromboembolism was 22 . 5 % in patients receiving THALOMID in combination with dexamethasone compared to 4 . 9 % in patients receiving dexamethasone alone ( p = 0 . 002 ) .
Ischemic heart disease ( 11 . 1 % ) , including myocardial infarction ( 1 . 3 % ) , and stroke ( cerebrovascular accident , 2 . 6 % ) have also occurred in patients with previously untreated MM treated with THALOMID and dexamethasone compared to placebo and dexamethasone ( 4 . 7 % , 1 . 7 % , and 0 . 9 % , respectively ) in one clinical trial [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Consider thromboprophylaxis based on an assessment of individual patients ' underlying risk factors .
Patients and physicians should be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism .
Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath , chest pain , or arm or leg swelling [ see Boxed Warning ] .
Agents that also may increase the risk of thromboembolism should be used with caution in patients receiving THALOMID [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 7 ) ] .
5 . 4 Increased Mortality in Patients with MM When Pembrolizumab Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In two randomized clinical trials in patients with MM , the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone , a use for which no PD - 1 or PD - L1 blocking antibody is indicated , resulted in increased mortality .
Treatment of patients with MM with a PD - 1 or PD - L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials .
5 . 5 Drowsiness and Somnolence THALOMID frequently causes drowsiness and somnolence .
Patients should be instructed to avoid situations where drowsiness may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause drowsiness without adequate medical advice [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Advise patients as to the possible impairment of mental and / or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks , such as driving a car or operating other complex or dangerous machinery .
Dose reductions may be required .
5 . 6 Peripheral Neuropathy THALOMID is known to cause nerve damage that may be permanent .
Peripheral neuropathy is a common ( ≥ 10 % ) and potentially severe adverse reaction of treatment with THALOMID that may be irreversible .
Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months ; however , peripheral neuropathy following relatively short - term use has been reported .
The correlation with cumulative dose is unclear .
Symptoms may occur some time after THALOMID treatment has been stopped and may resolve slowly or not at all .
Few reports of neuropathy have arisen in the treatment of ENL despite long - term THALOMID treatment .
However , the inability clinically to differentiate THALOMID neuropathy from the neuropathy often seen in ENL makes it difficult to determine accurately the incidence of THALOMID - related neuropathy in patients with ENL treated with THALOMID .
Patients should be examined at monthly intervals for the first 3 months of THALOMID therapy to enable the clinician to detect early signs of neuropathy , which include numbness , tingling or pain in the hands and feet .
Patients should be evaluated periodically thereafter during treatment .
Patients should be regularly counseled , questioned , and evaluated for signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy .
Consideration should be given to electrophysiological testing , consisting of measurement of sensory nerve action potential ( SNAP ) amplitudes at baseline and thereafter every 6 months in an effort to detect asymptomatic neuropathy .
If symptoms of drug - induced neuropathy develop , THALOMID should be discontinued immediately to limit further damage , if clinically appropriate .
Usually , treatment with THALOMID should only be reinitiated if the neuropathy returns to baseline status .
Medications known to be associated with neuropathy should be used with caution in patients receiving THALOMID [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension Patients should also be advised that THALOMID may cause dizziness and orthostatic hypotension and that , therefore , they should sit upright for a few minutes prior to standing up from a recumbent position .
5 . 8 Neutropenia Decreased white blood cell counts , including neutropenia , have been reported in association with the clinical use of THALOMID .
Treatment should not be initiated with an absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) of < 750 / mm3 .
White blood cell count and differential should be monitored on an ongoing basis , especially in patients who may be more prone to neutropenia , such as patients who are HIV - seropositive .
If ANC decreases to below 750 / mm3 while on treatment , the patient ' s medication regimen should be re - evaluated and , if the neutropenia persists , consideration should be given to withholding THALOMID if clinically appropriate .
5 . 9 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia , including Grade 3 or 4 occurrences , has been reported in association with the clinical use of THALOMID .
Monitor blood counts , including platelet counts .
Dose reduction , delay , or discontinuation may be required .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding including petechiae , epistaxis , and gastrointestinal bleeding , especially if concomitant medication may increase the risk of bleeding .
5 . 10 Increased HIV Viral Load In a randomized , placebo - controlled trial of thalidomide in an HIV - seropositive patient population , plasma HIV RNA levels were found to increase ( median change = 0 . 42 log10 copies HIV RNA / mL , p = 0 . 04 compared to placebo ) .
A similar trend was observed in a second , unpublished study conducted in patients who were HIV - seropositive .
The clinical significance of this increase is unknown .
Both studies were conducted prior to availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy .
Until the clinical significance of this finding is further understood , in HIV - seropositive patients , viral load should be measured after the first and third months of treatment and every 3 months thereafter .
5 . 11 Bradycardia Bradycardia in association with THALOMID use has been reported .
Cases of bradycardia have been reported , some required medical interventions .
The clinical significance and underlying etiology of the bradycardia noted in some THALOMID - treated patients are presently unknown .
Monitor patients for bradycardia and syncope .
Dose reduction or discontinuation may be required .
Medications known to decrease heart rate should be used with caution in patients receiving THALOMID [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 12 Severe Cutaneous Reactions Severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) have been reported with THALOMID use .
DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction ( such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis ) , eosinophilia , fever , and / or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis , nephritis , pneumonitis , myocarditis , and / or pericarditis .
These events can be fatal .
THALOMID interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2 - 3 skin rash .
Discontinue THALOMID for Grade 4 rash , exfoliative or bullous rash , or for other severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS , TEN , or DRESS , and do not resume therapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 13 Seizures Although not reported from pre - marketing controlled clinical trials , seizures , including grand mal convulsions , have been reported during post - approval use of THALOMID in clinical practice .
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
Most patients had disorders that may have predisposed them to seizure activity , and it is not currently known whether THALOMID has any epileptogenic influence .
During therapy with THALOMID , patients with a history of seizures or with other risk factors for the development of seizures should be monitored closely for clinical changes that could precipitate acute seizure activity .
5 . 14 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Monitor patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome ( e . g . , patients with high tumor burden prior to treatment ) and take appropriate precautions .
5 . 15 Contraceptive Risks Some contraceptive methods may pose a higher risk of adverse effects or may be medically contraindicated in some patients treated with THALOMID .
Because some patients may develop sudden , severe neutropenia and / or thrombocytopenia , use of an intrauterine device ( IUD ) or implantable contraception in these patients may carry an increased risk for infection or bleeding either at insertion , removal or during use .
Treatment with THALOMID , the presence of an underlying malignancy , and / or use of an estrogen - containing contraceptive can each increase the risk of thromboembolism .
It is not known if these risks of thromboembolism are additive .
However , they should be taken into consideration when choosing contraceptive methods .
5 . 16 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity , including angioedema and anaphylactic reactions to THALOMID has been reported .
Signs and symptoms have included the occurrence of erythematous macular rash , possibly associated with fever , tachycardia , and hypotension , and if severe , may necessitate interruption of therapy .
If the reaction recurs when dosing is resumed , THALOMID should be discontinued .
Do not resume THALOMID treatment after angioedema and anaphylaxis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .

( 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) • • It is not known whether concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives further increases the risk of thromboembolism with THALOMID .
( 5 . 15 , 7 . 4 ) • • Patients taking concomitant therapies such as erythropoietin stimulating agents or estrogen containing therapies may have an increased risk of thromboembolism .
( 7 . 7 ) 7 . 1 Opioids , Antihistamines , Antipsychotics , Anti - anxiety Agents , or Other CNS Depressants ( Including Alcohol ) The use of opioids , antihistamines , antipsychotics , anti - anxiety agents , or other CNS depressants concomitantly with THALOMID may cause an additive sedative effect and should be avoided .
7 . 2 Drugs which Cause Bradycardia The use of drugs which slow cardiac conduction concomitantly with THALOMID may cause an additive bradycardic effect and should be used with caution .
Cardiovascular medications which may cause bradycardia include calcium channel blockers , beta blockers , alpha / beta - adrenergic blockers , and digoxin .
Non - cardiac drugs that may cause bradycardia include H2 blockers ( e . g . , famotidine , cimetidine ) , lithium , tricyclic antidepressants and neuromuscular blockers ( succinylcholine ) .
In 16 healthy men , the pharmacokinetic profile of a single 0 . 5 mg digoxin dose was similar with and without the coadministration of THALOMID 200 mg / day at steady state levels .
The single dose of digoxin had no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of THALOMID .
The safety of long - term concomitant use of THALOMID and digoxin has not been evaluated .
7 . 3 Drugs which Cause Peripheral Neuropathy The use of drugs which cause peripheral neuropathy ( e . g . , bortezomib , amiodarone , cisplatin , docetaxel , paclitaxel , vincristine , disulfiram , phenytoin , metronidazole , alcohol ) can cause an additive effect and should be used with caution .
7 . 4 Hormonal Contraceptives Hormonal contraceptives increase the risk of thromboembolism .
It is not known whether concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives further increases the risk of thromboembolism with THALOMID .
In 10 healthy women , the pharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of a single dose containing 1 . 0 mg of norethindrone acetate and 75 mcg of ethinyl estradiol were studied .
The results were similar with and without coadministration of THALOMID 200 mg / day to steady - state levels .
7 . 5 Warfarin In 13 healthy men , the pharmacokinetic profile and international normalized ratio ( INR ) of prothrombin time for warfarin , following a single oral dose of 25 mg , were similar with and without the coadministration of THALOMID 200 mg / day at steady - state levels .
The single dose of warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of thalidomide .
7 . 6 Drugs that Interfere with Hormonal Contraceptives Concomitant use of HIV - protease inhibitors , griseofulvin , modafinil , penicillins , rifampin , rifabutin , phenytoin , carbamazepine , or certain herbal supplements such as St . John ' s Wort with hormonal contraceptive agents may reduce the effectiveness of the contraception up to one month after discontinuation of these concomitant therapies .
Therefore , females requiring treatment with one or more of these drugs must use two OTHER effective or highly effective methods of contraception while taking THALOMID .
7 . 7 Concomitant Therapies that may Increase the Risk of Thromboembolism Erythropoietic agents , or other agents that may increase the risk of thromboembolism , such as estrogen containing therapies , should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving THALOMID with dexamethasone [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to THALOMID during pregnancy as well as female partners of male patients who are exposed to THALOMID .
This registry is also used to understand the root cause for the pregnancy .
Report any suspected fetal exposure to THALOMID to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 and to the REMS Call Center at 1 - 888 - 423 - 5436 .
Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , human and animal data ( see Data ) , THALOMID can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy [ see Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4 . 1 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
THALOMID is a human teratogen , inducing a high frequency of severe and life - threatening birth defects such as amelia ( absence of limbs ) , phocomelia ( short limbs ) , hypoplasticity of the bones , absence of bones , external ear abnormalities ( including anotia , micropinna , small or absent external auditory canals ) , facial palsy , eye abnormalities ( anophthalmos , microphthalmos ) , and congenital heart defects .
Alimentary tract , urinary tract , and genital malformations have also been documented and mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40 % of infants .
Even a single dose taken by a pregnant woman can cause birth defects .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus .
If pregnancy does occur during treatment , immediately discontinue the drug .
Under these conditions , refer the patient to an obstetrician / gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling .
Report any suspected fetal exposure to THALOMID to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 and also the REMS Call Center at 1 - 888 - 423 - 5436 .
Thalidomide crossed the placenta after administration to pregnant hamsters ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The estimated background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 % - 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % - 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data A pre - and postnatal reproductive toxicity study was conducted in pregnant female rabbits .
Compound - related increased abortion incidences and elevated fetotoxicity were observed at the lowest oral dose level of 30 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1 . 5 - fold the maximum human dose based upon BSA ) and all higher dose levels .
Neonatal mortality was elevated at oral dose levels to the lactating female rabbits ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( approximately 7 . 5 - fold the maximum human dose based upon BSA ) .
No delay in postnatal development , including learning and memory functions , were noted at the oral dose level to the lactating female rabbits of 150 mg / kg / day ( average thalidomide concentrations in milk ranged from 22 to 36 mcg per mL ) .
In a study conducted in pregnant rabbits , thalidomide levels in fetal plasma were approximately 11 % to 73 % of the maternal Cmax .
In a study conducted with 14 C - thalidomide ( 150 mg / kg orally ) in pregnant hamsters , radioactivity was detected in the embryo , and the relative concentrations of radioactivity in the embryo and maternal plasma were about the same at 4 , 12 and 24 hours after dosing .
Based on the radioactivity data , thalidomide crossed the placental barrier , and the fetal levels of drug - related material were approximately similar to those of maternal levels .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of thalidomide in human milk , the effects of THALOMID on the breastfed child , or the effects of THALOMID on milk production .
Thalidomide is excreted in the milk of lactating rabbits ( see Data ) .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in a breastfed child from THALOMID , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with THALOMID .
Data Animal Data In lactating female rabbits at an oral dose of 150 mg / kg / day , the average thalidomide concentrations in milk ranged from 22 to 36 mcg per mL .
In the study of lactating female rabbits , high concentrations of thalidomide ( 7741 – 71425 ng per mL ) were noted in milk during four weeks of pre - weaning period .
Milk concentrations were 1 . 16 - 2 . 11 , 1 . 05 – 2 . 43 , and 0 . 64 – 3 . 63 times that of plasma at 30 , 150 and 500 mg / kg thalidomide doses , respectively ; thalidomide , as a lipophilic compound , distributed into milk , with concentrations attained similar to or slightly higher than those of systemic concentrations .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing THALOMID can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating THALOMID therapy and during therapy .
Advise females of reproductive potential that they must avoid pregnancy 4 weeks before therapy , while taking THALOMID , during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy .
Females of reproductive potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests before initiating THALOMID .
The first test should be performed within 10 - 14 days , and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing THALOMID .
Once treatment has started and during dose interruptions , pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential should occur weekly during the first 4 weeks of use , then pregnancy testing should be repeated every 4 weeks in females with regular menstrual cycles .
If menstrual cycles are irregular , the pregnancy testing should occur every 2 weeks .
Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrual bleeding .
THALOMID treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation .
Contraception Females Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously : one highly effective form of contraception – tubal ligation , IUD , hormonal ( birth control pills , injections , hormonal patches , vaginal rings , or implants ) , or partner ' s vasectomy , and 1 additional effective contraceptive method – male latex or synthetic condom , diaphragm , or cervical cap .
Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with THALOMID , during therapy , during dose interruptions , and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of THALOMID therapy .
Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility , unless due to hysterectomy .
Females of reproductive potential should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods , if needed .
Males Thalidomide is present in the semen of males who take THALOMID .
Therefore , males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking THALOMID , during dose interruptions and for up to 28 days after discontinuing THALOMID , even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy .
Male patients taking THALOMID must not donate sperm .
Infertility Based on findings in animals , male fertility may be compromised by treatment with THALOMID [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use One hundred and seventy - six ( 52 % ) of 336 patients treated with THALOMID in combination with dexamethasone were ≥ 65 of age while 50 ( 15 % ) were ≥ 75 .
Patients ≥ 65 years of age on Study 2 had higher incidences of atrial fibrillation , constipation , fatigue , nausea , hypokalemia , deep venous thrombosis , hyperglycemia , pulmonary embolism , and asthenia compared to patients < 65 .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Physical and psychological dependence has not been reported in patients taking THALOMID ; however , as with other tranquilizers / hypnotics , thalidomide has been reported to result in habituation to its soporific effects .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific antidote for a THALOMID overdose .
In the event of an overdose , the patient ' s vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care given to maintain blood pressure and respiratory status .
11 DESCRIPTION THALOMID , α - ( N - phthalimido ) glutarimide , is an immunomodulatory agent .
The empirical formula for thalidomide is C13H10N2O4 and the gram molecular weight is 258 . 2 .
The CAS number of thalidomide is 50 - 35 - 1 .
Chemical Structure of Thalidomide [ MULTIMEDIA ] Note : ∙ = asymmetric carbon atom Thalidomide is an off - white to white , odorless , crystalline powder that is soluble at 25 ° C in dimethyl sulfoxide and sparingly soluble in water and ethanol .
The glutarimide moiety contains a single asymmetric center and , therefore , may exist in either of two optically active forms designated S - ( - ) or R - ( + ) .
THALOMID is an equal mixture of the S - ( - ) and R - ( + ) forms and , therefore , has a net optical rotation of zero .
THALOMID is available in 50 mg , 100 mg , 150 mg and 200 mg capsules for oral administration .
Active ingredient : thalidomide .
Inactive ingredients : pregelatinized starch and magnesium stearate .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of THALOMID is not fully understood .
Cellular activities of thalidomide are mediated through its target cereblon , a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex .
THALOMID possesses immunomodulatory , anti - inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties .
Available data from in vitro studies and clinical trials suggest that the immunologic effects of this compound can vary substantially under different conditions , but may be related to suppression of excessive tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - α ) production and down - modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte migration .
For example , administration of thalidomide has been reported to decrease circulating levels of TNF - α in patients with erythema nodosum leprosum ( ENL ) ; however , it has also been shown to increase plasma TNF - α levels in HIV - seropositive patients .
Other anti - inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of thalidomide may include suppression of macrophage involvement in prostaglandin synthesis , and modulation of interleukin - 10 and interleukin - 12 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
Thalidomide treatment of multiple myeloma patients is accompanied by an increase in the number of circulating natural killer cells , and an increase in plasma levels of interleukin - 2 and interferon - gamma ( T cell - derived cytokines associated with cytotoxic activity ) .
Thalidomide was found to inhibit angiogenesis in a human umbilical artery explant model in vitro .
The cellular processes of angiogenesis inhibited by thalidomide may include the proliferation of endothelial cells .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Absorption of THALOMID is slow after oral administration .
The maximum plasma concentrations are reached approximately 2 - 5 hours after administration .
The absolute bioavailability of thalidomide from thalidomide capsules has not yet been characterized in human subjects due to its poor aqueous solubility .
Based on the 14 C - radiolabel thalidomide study in human , greater than 90 % of the total radioactivity is recovered in urine suggesting good oral absorption .
While the extent of absorption ( as measured by area under the curve [ AUC ] ) is proportional to dose in healthy subjects , the observed peak concentration ( Cmax ) increased in a less than proportional manner ( see Table 5 below ) .
This lack of Cmax dose proportionality , coupled with the observed increase in Tmax values , suggests that the poor solubility of thalidomide in aqueous media may be hindering the rate of absorption .
Table 5 : Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values for THALOMID Mean ( % CV ) Population / Single Dose AUC0 - ∞ mcg ∙ hr / mL Cmax mcg / mL Tmax ( hrs ) Half - life ( hrs ) Healthy Subjects ( n = 14 ) 50 mg 4 . 9 ( 16 % ) 0 . 62 ( 52 % ) 2 . 9 ( 66 % ) 5 . 52 ( 37 % ) 200 mg 18 . 9 ( 17 % ) 1 . 76 ( 30 % ) 3 . 5 ( 57 % ) 5 . 53 ( 25 % ) 400 mg 36 . 4 ( 26 % ) 2 . 82 ( 28 % ) 4 . 3 ( 37 % ) 7 . 29 ( 36 % ) Patients with Hansen ' s Disease ( n = 6 ) 400 mg 46 . 4 ( 44 . 1 % ) 3 . 44 ( 52 . 6 % ) 5 . 7 ( 27 % ) 6 . 86 ( 17 % ) Coadministration of THALOMID ( thalidomide ) with a high - fat meal causes minor ( < 10 % ) changes in the observed AUC and Cmax values ; however , it causes an increase in Tmax to approximately 6 hours .
Distribution In human plasma , the geometric mean plasma protein binding was 55 % and 66 % , respectively , for ( + ) - ( R ) - and ( - ) - ( S ) - thalidomide .
In a pharmacokinetic study of thalidomide in HIV - seropositive adult male subjects receiving thalidomide 100 mg / day , thalidomide was detectable in the semen .
Metabolism In a 14 C - radiolabel ADME study in humans , unchanged drug is the predominant circulating component .
Thalidomide is not a substrate of the cytochrome P450 system .
At therapeutic concentrations , thalidomide is not an inhibitor or inducer of human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro .
Pharmacokinetic drug - drug interactions with substrates , inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 are not anticipated .
Elimination The mean elimination half - life of thalidomide in plasma following single oral doses between 50 mg and 400 mg was 5 . 5 to 7 . 3 hours .
Following a single 400 mg oral dose of radiolabeled thalidomide , the total mean recovery was 93 . 6 % of the administered dose by Day 8 .
The majority of the radioactive dose was excreted within 48 hours following dose administration .
In humans , 14 C - thalidomide is primarily excreted in urine ( 91 . 9 % of the radioactive dose ) mainly as hydrolytic metabolites while fecal excretion is minor ( < 2 % of the dose ) .
Unchanged thalidomide is not eliminated by the kidney to a notable degree ( < 3 . 5 % of the dose ) .
Effects of Weight There is a linear relationship between body weight and estimated thalidomide clearance .
In MM patients with body weight from 47 - 133 kg , thalidomide clearance ranged from approximately 6 - 12 L / h , representing an increase in thalidomide clearance of 0 . 605 L / h per 10 kg body weight increase .
Effects of Age , Gender and Race Analysis of the data from pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers and patients with Hansen ' s disease ranging in age from 20 to 69 years does not reveal any age - related changes .
While a comparative trial of the effects of gender on thalidomide pharmacokinetics has not been conducted , examination of the data for thalidomide does not reveal any significant gender differences in pharmacokinetic parameter values .
Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied .
Pharmacokinetic Data in Special Populations HIV - seropositive Subjects : There is no apparent significant difference in measured pharmacokinetic parameter values between healthy human subjects and HIV - seropositive subjects following single - dose administration of THALOMID Capsules .
Patients with Hansen ' s Disease : Analysis of data from a small study in Hansen ' s patients suggests that these patients , relative to healthy subjects , may have an increased bioavailability of THALOMID .
The increase is reflected both in an increased area under the curve and in increased peak plasma levels .
The clinical significance of this increase is unknown .
Pediatric : No pharmacokinetic data are available in subjects below the age of 18 years .
Patients with Renal Impairment : Renal impairment is not expected to influence drug exposure since < 3 . 5 % of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment : No clinical studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Two - year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in male and female rats and mice .
No compound - related tumorigenic effects were observed at the highest dose levels of 3 , 000 mg / kg / day to male and female mice ( 38 - fold greater than the highest recommended daily human dose of 400 mg based upon body surface area [ BSA ] ) , 3 , 000 mg / kg / day to female rats ( 75 - fold the maximum human dose based upon BSA ) , and 300 mg / kg / day to male rats ( 7 . 5 - fold the maximum human dose based upon BSA ) .
Thalidomide was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic in the following assays : the Ames bacterial ( S . typhimurium and E . coli ) reverse mutation assay , a Chinese hamster ovary cell ( AS52 / XPRT ) forward mutation assay , and an in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
Fertility studies were conducted in male and female rabbits ; no compound - related effects in mating and fertility indices were observed at any oral thalidomide dose level including the highest of 100 mg / kg / day to female rabbits and 500 mg / kg / day to male rabbits ( approximately 5 - and 25 - fold the maximum human dose , respectively , based upon BSA ) .
Testicular pathological and histopathological effects ( classified as slight ) were seen in male rabbits at dose levels ≥ 30 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1 . 5 - fold the maximum human dose based upon BSA ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) The efficacy and safety of THALOMID in patients with multiple myeloma were evaluated in two randomized , multi - center studies ( Study 1 and Study 2 ) .
Study 1 was an open - label study which randomized 207 symptomatic patients with newly diagnosed MM to THALOMID plus dexamethasone ( N = 103 ) versus dexamethasone alone ( N = 104 ) .
The THALOMID dose was 200 mg daily and the dexamethasone dose was 40 mg orally once daily on days 1 - 4 , 9 - 12 , and 17 - 20 every 28 - days .
Each group was treated for four 28 - day cycles .
Study 2 randomized 470 newly diagnosed patients with MM to THALOMID plus dexamethasone ( N = 235 ) versus placebo plus dexamethasone ( N = 235 ) .
In the THALOMID / dexamethasone arm , a starting dose of thalidomide 50 mg was escalated to 200 mg / day ( cycle 2 ) once daily for 28 days .
Patients in both treatment groups took 40 mg of dexamethasone once daily given on days 1 - 4 , 9 - 12 , and 17 - 20 ( every 28 days ) .
Beginning with Cycle 5 , the dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each cycle .
Treatment continued as tolerated until disease progression .
Baseline demographics for both studies are presented in Table 6 and disease characteristics for the study population are summarized in Tables 7 ( Study 1 ) and 8 ( Study 2 ) .
