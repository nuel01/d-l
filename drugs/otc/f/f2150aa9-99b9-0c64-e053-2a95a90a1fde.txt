CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established , but may be due to general central nervous system ( CNS ) depression .
It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle , the motor end plate or the nerve fiber .
Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers , the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0 . 20 and 0 . 80 L / h / kg , the mean plasma elimination half - life ranges between 1 and 2 hours , and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46 % and 50 % .
Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation .
Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely .
Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine .
Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Methocarbamol tablets , USP are indicated as an adjunct to rest , physical therapy , and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute , painful musculoskeletal conditions .
The mode of action of methocarbamol has not been clearly identified , but may be related to its sedative properties .

Drug interactions See Warnings and Precautions for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol .
Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide .
Therefore , methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents .
Drug / laboratory test interactions Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5 - HIAA ) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid ( VMA ) using the Gitlow method .
Carcinogenesis , mutagenesis , impairment of fertility Long - term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed .
No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility .
Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol .
It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Methocarbamol tablets , USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
