5 . 1 Infusion - Related Reactions DARZALEX can cause severe and / or serious infusion - related reactions including anaphylactic reactions .
These reactions can be life - threatening and fatal outcomes have been reported [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 3 ) ] .
In clinical trials ( monotherapy and combination : N = 2 , 066 ) , infusion - related reactions occurred in 37 % of patients with the Week 1 ( 16 mg / kg ) infusion , 2 % with the Week 2 infusion , and cumulatively 6 % with subsequent infusions .
Less than 1 % of patients had a Grade 3 / 4 infusion - related reaction at Week 2 or subsequent infusions .
The median time to onset was 1 . 5 hours ( range : 0 to 73 hours ) .
The incidence of infusion modification due to reactions was 36 % .
Median durations of 16 mg / kg infusions for the Week 1 , Week 2 , and subsequent infusions were approximately 7 , 4 , and 3 hours respectively .
Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or within 4 hours of completing DARZALEX .
Prior to the introduction of post - infusion medication in clinical trials , infusion - related reactions occurred up to 48 hours after infusion .
Severe reactions have occurred , including bronchospasm , hypoxia , dyspnea , hypertension , tachycardia , headache , laryngeal edema , pulmonary edema , and ocular adverse reactions , including choroidal effusion , acute myopia , and acute angle closure glaucoma .
Signs and symptoms may include respiratory symptoms , such as nasal congestion , cough , throat irritation , as well as chills , vomiting and nausea .
Less common signs and symptoms were wheezing , allergic rhinitis , pyrexia , chest discomfort , pruritus , hypotension , and blurred vision [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
When DARZALEX dosing was interrupted in the setting of ASCT ( CASSIOPEIA ) for a median of 3 . 75 months ( range : 2 . 4 to 6 . 9 months ) , upon re - initiation of DARZALEX , the incidence of infusion - related reactions was 11 % for the first infusion following ASCT .
Infusion rate / dilution volume used upon re - initiation was that used for the last DARZALEX infusion prior to interruption for ASCT .
Infusion - related reactions occurring at re - initiation of DARZALEX following ASCT were consistent in terms of symptoms and severity ( Grade 3 or 4 : < 1 % ) with those reported in previous studies at Week 2 or subsequent infusions .
In EQUULEUS , patients receiving combination treatment ( n = 97 ) were administered the first 16 mg / kg dose at Week 1 split over two days i . e . 8 mg / kg on Day 1 and Day 2 , respectively .
The incidence of any grade infusion - related reactions was 42 % , with 36 % of patients experiencing infusion - related reactions on Day 1 of Week 1 , 4 % on Day 2 of Week 1 , and 8 % with subsequent infusions .
The median time to onset of a reaction was 1 . 8 hours ( range : 0 . 1 to 5 . 4 hours ) .
The incidence of infusion interruptions due to reactions was 30 % .
Median durations of infusions were 4 . 2 hours for Week 1 - Day 1 , 4 . 2 hours for Week 1 - Day 2 , and 3 . 4 hours for the subsequent infusions .
Pre - medicate patients with antihistamines , antipyretics and corticosteroids .
Frequently monitor patients during the entire infusion [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Interrupt DARZALEX infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed .
Permanently discontinue DARZALEX therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life - threatening ( Grade 4 ) reaction occurs and institute appropriate emergency care .
For patients with Grade 1 , 2 , or 3 reactions , reduce the infusion rate when re - starting the infusion [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
To reduce the risk of delayed infusion - related reactions , administer oral corticosteroids to all patients following DARZALEX infusions [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post - infusion medications to manage respiratory complications .
Consider prescribing short - and long - acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Ocular adverse reactions , including acute myopia and narrowing of the anterior chamber angle due to ciliochoroidal effusions with potential for increased intraocular pressure or glaucoma , have occurred with DARZALEX infusion .
If ocular symptoms occur , interrupt DARZALEX infusion and seek immediate ophthalmologic evaluation prior to restarting DARZALEX .
5 . 2 Interference with Serological Testing Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells ( RBCs ) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test ( Indirect Coombs test ) .
Daratumumab - mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab infusion .
Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient ' s serum [ see References ( 15 ) ] .
The determination of a patient ' s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX .
Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Neutropenia DARZALEX may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer ' s prescribing information for background therapies .
Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection .
Consider withholding DARZALEX until recovery of neutrophils .
5 . 4 Thrombocytopenia DARZALEX may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer ' s prescribing information for background therapies .
Consider withholding DARZALEX until recovery of platelets .
5 . 5 Interference with Determination of Complete Response Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both , the serum protein electrophoresis ( SPE ) and immunofixation ( IFE ) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M - protein [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein .
5 . 6 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action , DARZALEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
DARZALEX may cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
The combination of DARZALEX with lenalidomide , pomalidomide , or thalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women , because lenalidomide , pomalidomide , and thalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child .
Refer to the lenalidomide , pomalidomide , or thalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy .

In monotherapy studies , herpes zoster was reported in 3 % of patients .
In the combination therapy studies , herpes zoster was reported in 2 – 5 % of patients receiving DARZALEX .
Infections Grade 3 or 4 infections were reported as follows : • Relapsed / refractory patient studies : DVd : 21 % vs . Vd : 19 % ; DRd : 28 % vs . Rd : 23 % ; DPd : 28 % ; DKd [ 1 ] : 37 % , Kd null : 29 % ; DKd [ 2 ] : 21 % • Newly diagnosed patient studies : D - VMP : 23 % , VMP : 15 % ; DRd : 32 % , Rd : 23 % ; DVTd : 22 % ; VTd : 20 % .
Pneumonia was the most commonly reported severe ( Grade 3 or 4 ) infection across studies .
In active controlled studies , discontinuations from treatment due to infections occurred in 1 – 4 % of patients .
Fatal infections ( Grade 5 ) were reported as follows : • Relapsed / refractory patient studies : DVd : 1 % , Vd : 2 % ; DRd : 2 % , Rd : 1 % ; DPd : 2 % ; DKd null : 5 % , Kd null : 3 % ; DKd null : 0 % • Newly diagnosed patient studies : D - VMP : 1 % , VMP : 1 % ; DRd : 2 % , Rd : 2 % ; DVTd : 0 % , VTd : 0 % .
Fatal infections were generally infrequent and balanced between the DARZALEX containing regimens and active control arms .
Fatal infections were primarily due to pneumonia and sepsis .
Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation has been reported in less than 1 % of patients ( including fatal cases ) treated with DARZALEX in clinical trials .
Other Clinical Trials Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported following administration of daratumumab and hyaluronidase for subcutaneous injection : Nervous System disorders : Syncope [ 1 ] where carfilzomib 20 / 56 mg / m 2 was administered twice - weekly [ 2 ] where carfilzomib 20 / 70 mg / m 2 was administered once - weekly 6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is the potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other daratumumab products may be misleading .
In clinical trials of patients with multiple myeloma treated with DARZALEX as monotherapy or as combination therapies , 0 . 35 % ( 6 / 1 , 713 ) of patients developed treatment - emergent anti - daratumumab antibodies .
Of those , 4 patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of daratumumab .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Immune System disorders : Anaphylactic reaction , IRR ( including deaths ) Gastrointestinal disorders : Pancreatitis Infections : Cytomegalovirus , Listeriosis 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Effects of Daratumumab on Laboratory Tests Interference with Indirect Antiglobulin Tests ( Indirect Coombs Test ) Daratumumab binds to CD38 on RBCs and interferes with compatibility testing , including antibody screening and cross matching .
Daratumumab interference mitigation methods include treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol ( DTT ) to disrupt daratumumab binding [ see References ( 15 ) ] or genotyping .
Since the Kell blood group system is also sensitive to DTT treatment , supply K - negative units after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT - treated RBCs .
If an emergency transfusion is required , administer non - cross - matched ABO / RhD - compatible RBCs per local blood bank practices .
Interference with Serum Protein Electrophoresis and Immunofixation Tests Daratumumab may be detected on serum protein electrophoresis ( SPE ) and immunofixation ( IFE ) assays used for monitoring disease monoclonal immunoglobulins ( M protein ) .
False positive SPE and IFE assay results may occur for patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein impacting initial assessment of complete responses by International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) criteria .
In patients with persistent very good partial response , where daratumumab interference is suspected , consider using a FDA - approved daratumumab - specific IFE assay to distinguish daratumumab from any remaining endogenous M protein in the patient ' s serum , to facilitate determination of a complete response .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary DARZALEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
The assessment of associated risks with daratumumab products is based on the mechanism of action and data from target antigen CD38 knockout animal models ( see Data ) .
There are no available data on the use of DARZALEX in pregnant women to evaluate drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
The combination of DARZALEX and lenalidomide , pomalidomide , or thalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women , because lenalidomide , pomalidomide , and thalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child .
Lenalidomide , pomalidomide , and thalidomide are only available through a REMS program .
Refer to the lenalidomide , pomalidomide , or thalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions Immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibodies are transferred across the placenta .
Based on its mechanism of action , DARZALEX may cause depletion of fetal CD38 positive immune cells and decreased bone density .
Defer administering live vaccines to neonates and infants exposed to DARZALEX in utero until a hematology evaluation is completed .
Data Animal Data Mice that were genetically modified to eliminate all CD38 expression ( CD38 knockout mice ) had reduced bone density at birth that recovered by 5 months of age .
Data from studies using CD38 knockout animal models also suggest the involvement of CD38 in regulating humoral immune responses ( mice ) , feto - maternal immune tolerance ( mice ) , and early embryonic development ( frogs ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data on the presence of daratumumab in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Maternal immunoglobulin G is known to be present in human milk .
Published data suggest that antibodies in breast milk do not enter the neonatal and infant circulations in substantial amounts .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child when DARZALEX is administered with lenalidomide , pomalidomide , or thalidomide , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with DARZALEX .
Refer to lenalidomide , pomalidomide , or thalidomide prescribing information for additional information .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential DARZALEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing With the combination of DARZALEX with lenalidomide , pomalidomide , or thalidomide , refer to the lenalidomide , pomalidomide , or thalidomide labeling for pregnancy testing requirements prior to initiating treatment in females of reproductive potential .
Contraception Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX and for 3 months after the last dose .
Additionally , refer to the lenalidomide , pomalidomide , or thalidomide labeling for additional recommendations for contraception .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of DARZALEX in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 2 , 459 patients who received DARZALEX at the recommended dose , 38 % were 65 to 74 years of age , and 15 % were 75 years of age or older .
No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
The incidence of serious adverse reactions was higher in older than in younger patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Among patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma ( n = 1 , 213 ) , the serious adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in patients 65 years and older were pneumonia and sepsis .
Within the DKd group in CANDOR , fatal adverse reactions occurred in 14 % of patients 65 years and older compared to 6 % of patients less than 65 years .
Among patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant ( n = 710 ) , the serious adverse reaction that occurred more frequently in patients 75 years and older was pneumonia .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein ( 48 kDa ) expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells , including multiple myeloma and other cell types and tissues and has multiple functions , such as receptor mediated adhesion , signaling , and modulation of cyclase and hydrolase activity .
Daratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) that binds to CD38 and inhibits the growth of CD38 expressing tumor cells by inducing apoptosis directly through Fc mediated cross linking as well as by immune - mediated tumor cell lysis through complement dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC ) , antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis ( ADCP ) .
A subset of myeloid derived suppressor cells ( CD38 + MDSCs ) , regulatory T cells ( CD38 + T regs ) and B cells ( CD38 + B regs ) are decreased by daratumumab .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics NK cells express CD38 and are susceptible to daratumumab mediated cell lysis .
Decreases in absolute counts and percentages of total NK cells ( CD16 + CD56 + ) and activated ( CD16 + CD56 dim ) NK cells in peripheral whole blood and bone marrow were observed with DARZALEX treatment .
Exposure - Response Relationship The exposure - response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamics of DARZALEX have not been fully characterized .
Cardiac Electrophysiology DARZALEX as a large protein has a low likelihood of direct ion channel interactions .
There is no evidence from non - clinical or clinical data to suggest that DARZALEX has the potential to delay ventricular repolarization .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Daratumumab area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC ) increases more than proportionally over a dosage range from 1 to 24 mg / kg ( 0 . 06 to 1 . 5 times the approved recommended dosage ) as monotherapy or 1 to 16 mg / kg ( 0 . 06 to 1 time the approved recommended dosage ) as combination therapy .
Following administration of the approved recommended dosage of DARZALEX as monotherapy or in combination therapy , the mean serum maximal concentration ( C max ) was approximately 2 . 7 to 3 - fold higher at the end of weekly dosing compared to the first dose .
The mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) trough serum concentration ( C min ) at the end of weekly dosing was 573 ± 332 µg / mL when DARZALEX was administered as monotherapy and 502 ± 196 to 607 ± 231 µg / mL when DARZALEX was administered as combination therapy .
Split dosing of the first dose resulted in a different PK profile in the first day compared to single dosing ; however , similar C max and C min concentrations were both predicted and observed following the administration of the second split dose on Week 1 Day 2 .
When DARZALEX was administered as monotherapy , daratumumab steady state was achieved approximately 5 months into the every 4 - week dosing period ( by the 21 st infusion ) .
At steady state , daratumumab mean ± SD accumulation ratio for C max was 1 . 6 ± 0 . 5 .
Distribution Daratumumab volume of distribution was 4 . 7 ± 1 . 3 L as monotherapy and 4 . 4 ± 1 . 5 L as combination therapy following administration of the approved dosage .
Elimination Daratumumab clearance decreased with increasing dose and with multiple dosing .
The mean ± SD linear clearance was estimated to be 171 . 4 ± 95 . 3 mL / day and the mean ± SD estimated terminal half - life associated with linear clearance was 18 ± 9 days following administration of the approved recommended dosage of DARZALEX as monotherapy .
Terminal half - life was similar when DARZALEX was administered as combination therapy .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of daratumumab as monotherapy or as combination therapy were observed based on sex , age ( 31 to 93 years ) , mild [ total bilirubin 1 to 1 . 5 times upper limit of normal ( ULN ) or aspartate aminotransaminase ( AST ) > ULN ] and moderate ( total bilirubin 1 . 5 to 3 times ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment , or renal impairment [ Creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) 15 – 89 mL / min ] .
The effect of severe ( total bilirubin > 3 times ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment on daratumumab pharmacokinetics is unknown .
Body Weight The central volume of distribution and clearance of daratumumab increased with increasing body weight .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have been conducted with daratumumab .
No animal studies have been performed to evaluate the potential effects of daratumumab on reproduction or development , or to determine potential effects on fertility in males or females .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Combination Treatment with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Patients Ineligible for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant MAIA ( NCT02252172 ) , an open - label , randomized , active - controlled trial , compared treatment with DARZALEX 16 mg / kg in combination with lenalidomide and low - dose dexamethasone ( DRd ) to treatment with lenalidomide and low - dose dexamethasone ( Rd ) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant .
Lenalidomide ( 25 mg once daily orally on Days 1 – 21 of repeated 28 - day [ 4 - week ] cycles ) was given with low dose oral or intravenous dexamethasone 40 mg / week ( or a reduced dose of 20 mg / week for patients > 75 years or body mass index [ BMI ] < 18 . 5 ) .
On DARZALEX infusion days , the dexamethasone dose was given as a pre - infusion medication .
Treatment was continued in both arms until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
A total of 737 patients were randomized : 368 to the DRd arm and 369 to the Rd arm .
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups .
The median age was 73 ( range : 45 – 90 ) years , with 44 % of the patients ≥ 75 years of age .
Fifty - two percent ( 52 % ) of patients were male , 92 % White , 4 % Black or African American , and 1 % Asian .
Three percent ( 3 % ) of patients reported an ethnicity of Hispanic or Latino .
Thirty - four ( 34 % ) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance score of 0 , 50 % had an ECOG performance score of 1 and 17 % had an ECOG performance score of ≥ 2 .
Twenty - seven percent had International Staging System ( ISS ) Stage I , 43 % had ISS Stage II and 29 % had ISS Stage III disease .
Efficacy was evaluated by progression free survival ( PFS ) based on International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) criteria .
MAIA demonstrated an improvement in Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) in the DRd arm as compared to the Rd arm ; the median PFS had not been reached in the DRd arm and was 31 . 9 months in the Rd arm ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 0 . 56 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 43 , 0 . 73 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) , representing 44 % reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated with DRd .
After a median follow - up of 64 months , the median PFS was 61 . 9 months ( 95 % CI : 54 . 8 , NE ) in the DRd arm and 34 . 4 months ( 95 % CI : 29 . 6 , 39 . 2 ) in the Rd arm .
Figure 1 : Kaplan - Meier Curve of PFS in MAIA [ 1 ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ 1 ] PFS median follow - up of 28 months After a median follow - up of 56 months , MAIA demonstrated an improvement in overall survival ( OS ) in the DRd arm as compared to the Rd arm ( HR = 0 . 68 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 53 , 0 . 86 ; p = 0 . 0013 ) , representing a 32 % reduction in the risk of death in patients treated in the DRd arm .

The median duration of response had not been reached in the DRd group and was 34 . 7 months ( 95 % CI : 30 . 8 , not estimable ) in the Rd group .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Combination Treatment with Bortezomib , Melphalan and Prednisone ( VMP ) in Patients Ineligible for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant ALCYONE ( NCT02195479 ) , an open - label , randomized , active - controlled trial , compared treatment with DARZALEX 16 mg / kg in combination with bortezomib , melphalan and prednisone ( D - VMP ) , to treatment with VMP in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant .
Bortezomib was administered by subcutaneous ( SC ) injection at a dose of 1 . 3 mg / m 2 body surface area twice weekly at Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 for the first 6 - week cycle ( Cycle 1 ; 8 doses ) , followed by once weekly administrations at Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 for eight more 6 - week cycles ( Cycles 2 – 9 ; 4 doses per cycle ) .
Melphalan at 9 mg / m 2 , and prednisone at 60 mg / m 2 were orally administered on Days 1 to 4 of the nine 6 - week cycles ( Cycles 1 – 9 ) .
DARZALEX was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
A total of 706 patients were randomized : 350 to the D - VMP arm and 356 to the VMP arm .
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups .
The median age was 71 ( range : 40 – 93 ) years , with 30 % of the patients ≥ 75 years of age .
The majority were white ( 85 % ) , female ( 54 % ) , 25 % had an ECOG performance score of 0 , 50 % had an ECOG performance score of 1 and 25 % had an ECOG performance score of 2 .
Nineteen percent of patients had ISS Stage I , 42 % had ISS Stage II and 38 % had ISS Stage III disease .
Efficacy was evaluated by PFS based on IMWG criteria and overall survival ( OS ) .
ALCYONE demonstrated an improvement in PFS in the D - VMP arm as compared to the VMP arm ( HR = 0 . 50 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 38 , 0 . 65 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) , representing a 50 % reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated with D - VMP .
After a median follow - up of 40 months , the median PFS was 36 . 4 months ( 95 % CI : 32 . 1 , 45 . 9 ) in the D - VMP arm and 19 . 3 months ( 95 % CI : 18 . 0 , 20 . 4 ) in the VMP arm .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Combination Treatment with Bortezomib , Thalidomide and Dexamethasone in Patients Eligible for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant ( ASCT ) CASSIOPEIA ( NCT02541383 ) , an open - label , randomized , active - controlled trial compared induction and consolidation treatment with DARZALEX 16 mg / kg in combination with bortezomib , thalidomide and dexamethasone ( DVTd ) to treatment with bortezomib , thalidomide and dexamethasone ( VTd ) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma eligible for ASCT .
The consolidation phase of treatment began a minimum of 30 days post - ASCT , when the patient had recovered sufficiently , and engraftment was complete .
The trial was limited to patients 65 years of age and younger .
Bortezomib was administered by subcutaneous ( SC ) injection or intravenous ( IV ) injection at a dose of 1 . 3 mg / m 2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks ( Days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 ) of repeated 28 - day ( 4 - week ) induction treatment cycles ( Cycles 1 – 4 ) and two consolidation cycles ( Cycles 5 and 6 ) following ASCT after Cycle 4 .
Thalidomide was administered orally at 100 mg daily during the six bortezomib cycles .
Dexamethasone ( oral or intravenous ) was administered at 40 mg on Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 , 22 and 23 of Cycles 1 and 2 , and at 40 mg on Days 1 – 2 and 20 mg on subsequent dosing days ( Days 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 ) of Cycles 3 – 4 .
Dexamethasone 20 mg was administered on Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 in Cycles 5 and 6 .
On the days of DARZALEX infusion , the dexamethasone dose was administered intravenously as a pre - infusion medication .
A total of 1 , 085 patients were randomized : 543 to the DVTd arm and 542 to the VTd arm .
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups .
The median age was 58 years ( range : 22 to 65 years ) .
The majority were male ( 59 % ) , 48 % had an ECOG performance score of 0 , 42 % had an ECOG performance score of 1 and 10 % had an ECOG performance score of 2 .
