INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ferric Subsulfate , Aqueous , is a stypic agent used for achieving local hemostasis .
In punch biopsies of the full dermis , the time to achieve hemostasis is typically less than 20 seconds . 1 One method of applying ferric subsulfate solution for dermal use consists of the physician placing fingers at the opposite edge of the wound and stretching the skin .
The wound is then wiped with gauze , the ferric subsulfate solution applied , and the tension maintained for approximately 15 seconds . 2 WARNINGS For External Use Only .
Should inadvertent eye contact occur , the eye ( s ) should be washed immediately with large amounts of water or normal saline , occasionally lifting the upper and lower lids until no evidence of solution remains ( approximately 15 - 20 minutes ) .
PRECAUTIONS As with all iron solutions applied to dermal surfaces denuded of epithelium or to mucous membranes topical application of Ferric Subsulfate Aqueous ( ferric subsulfate ) may result in hyperpigmentation ( “ tattooing ” ) . 3 , 4 Microscopically , this hyperpigmentation may be observed as ferrugination of collagen fibers and fibrin . 5 In one study of uterine cervical tissue , ferric subsulfate solution penetrated denuded mucosa and produced coagulation necrosis to a maximum depth of 0 . 6 mm . 6 In an in vitro study , ferric subsulfate solution produced a radiopacity with a density intermediate between that of water / tissue and calcium . 7 Should a re - biopsy of the same lesion be required , pathologists and other physicians involved in the care of the patient should be aware of the previous use of ferric subsulfate solution .
Previous use of ferric subsulfate solution may result in a histologic artifact upon re - biopsy of heavy pigmentation , similar to hemosiderin , together with shrinkage and discoloration of collagen bundles . 8 , 9 Similarly , previous use of ferric subsulfate solution may result in a radiographic artifact .
CAUTION Federal law ( USA ) prohibits dispensing without a prescription .
