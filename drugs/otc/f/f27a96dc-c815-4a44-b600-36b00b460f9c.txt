The intravitreal injection procedure must be carried out under aseptic conditions , which includes the use of surgical hand disinfection , sterile gloves , a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum ( or equivalent ) , and the availability of sterile paracentesis equipment ( if required ) .
Adequate anesthesia and a broad - spectrum topical microbicide to disinfect the periocular skin , eyelid , and ocular surface should be administered prior to the injection .
Inject slowly until the rubber stopper reaches the end of the syringe to deliver the volume of 0 . 05 mL .
Confirm delivery of the full dose by checking that the rubber stopper has reached the end of the syringe barrel .
Immediately following the intravitreal injection , patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure ( IOP ) .
Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry .
If required , a sterile paracentesis needle should be available .
Following intravitreal injection , patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment ( e . g . , eye pain , redness of the eye , photophobia , blurring of vision ) without delay [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Each vial or pre - filled syringe should only be used for the treatment of a single eye .
If the contralateral eye requires treatment , a new vial or pre - filled syringe should be used and the sterile field , syringe , gloves , drapes , eyelid speculum , filter , and injection needles should be changed before BEOVU is administered to the other eye .
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations .

Hypersensitivity reactions may manifest as rash , pruritus , urticaria , erythema , or severe intraocular inflammation .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Endophthalmitis and retinal detachment may occur following intravitreal injections .
Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Retinal vasculitis and / or retinal vascular occlusion , typically in the presence of intraocular inflammation , have been reported following BEOVU injections .
Patients should be instructed to report any change in vision without delay ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Increases in intraocular pressure ( IOP ) have been seen within 30 minutes of an intravitreal injection ( 5 . 3 ) .
• There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events ( ATE ) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors ( 5 . 4 ) .
5 . 1 Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachment Intravitreal injections , including those with BEOVU , have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachment [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering BEOVU .
Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 2 Retinal Vasculitis and / or Retinal Vascular Occlusion Retinal vasculitis and / or retinal vascular occlusion , typically in the presence of intraocular inflammation , have been reported with the use of BEOVU .
These immune - mediated adverse events may occur following the first intravitreal injection .
Discontinue treatment with BEOVU in patients who develop these events .
Patients treated with BEOVU who experience intraocular inflammation may be at risk of developing retinal vasculitis and / or retinal vascular occlusion and should be closely monitored [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 ) ] .
Patients should be instructed to report any change in vision without delay .
5 . 3 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Acute increases in intraocular pressure ( IOP ) have been seen within 30 minutes of intravitreal injection , including with BEOVU [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Sustained IOP increases have also been reported .
Both IOP and perfusion of the optic nerve head must be monitored and managed appropriately [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 4 Thromboembolic Events Although there was a low rate of arterial thromboembolic events ( ATEs ) observed in the BEOVU clinical trials , there is a potential risk of ATEs following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors .
Arterial thromboembolic events are defined as nonfatal stroke , nonfatal myocardial infarction , or vascular death ( including deaths of unknown cause ) .
The ATE rate in the two controlled 96 - week neovascular AMD studies ( HAWK and HARRIER ) during the first 96 - weeks was 4 . 5 % ( 33 of 730 ) in the pooled brolucizumab arms compared with 4 . 7 % ( 34 of 729 ) in the pooled aflibercept arms [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following potentially serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Hypersensitivity [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 3 ) ] • Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Retinal Vasculitis and / or Retinal Vascular Occlusion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Increase in Intraocular Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Thromboembolic Events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] The most common adverse reactions reported in patients receiving BEOVU are vision blurred , cataract , conjunctival hemorrhage , eye pain , and vitreous floaters ( 6 . 1 ) .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
A total of 1 , 646 patients treated with brolucizumab constituted the safety population in four Phase 3 studies .
Among these , 1 , 098 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 6 mg .
A total of 1088 patients treated with brolucizumab , constituted the safety population in the two controlled neovascular AMD Phase 3 studies ( HAWK and HARRIER ) with a cumulative 96 - week exposure to BEOVU , and 730 patients treated with the recommended dose of 6 mg [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
A total of 558 patients treated with brolucizumab constituted the safety population in the two controlled DME Phase 3 studies ( KESTREL and KITE ) from baseline to week 52 , including 368 patients treated with the recommended dose of 6 mg [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .

The interval between two BEOVU doses during maintenance treatment should not be less than 8 weeks .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for an immune response in patients treated with BEOVU .
The immunogenicity of BEOVU was evaluated in serum samples .
The immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to BEOVU in immunoassays .
The detection of an immune response is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays used , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to BEOVU with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading .
Anti - brolucizumab antibodies were detected in the pre - treatment sample of 36 % to 64 % of treatment naive patients .
After initiation of dosing , anti - brolucizumab antibodies were detected in at least one serum sample in 53 % to 76 % of patients treated with BEOVU .
Intraocular inflammation was observed in 6 % of patients with anti - brolucizumab antibodies detected during dosing with BEOVU in clinical trials .
Retinal vasculitis and / or retinal vascular occlusion , typically in the presence of intraocular inflammation , are immune - mediated adverse events related to exposure to BEOVU .
This treatment - emergent antibody response may develop following the first intravitreal injection .
Anti - brolucizumab antibodies were not associated with an impact on clinical efficacy .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of BEOVU administration in pregnant women .
In an animal reproduction study , intravitreal administration of brolucizumab to pregnant monkeys once every 4 weeks in one eye from organogenesis to birth caused fetal loss and a structural abnormality ( bilateral absent metatarsal ) in offspring at 10 - fold the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) on a mg / kg basis [ see Data ] .
Based on the anti - VEGF mechanism of action for brolucizumab [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , treatment with BEOVU may pose a risk to human embryo - fetal development .
BEOVU should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , and other adverse outcomes .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2 % to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data In an enhanced pre - and postnatal development ( ePPND ) study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys , brolucizumab was administered to all animals by intravitreal ( IVT ) injection to one eye at doses of 3 or 6 mg once every 4 weeks until delivery .
Given the intermittent exposure profile and low group delivered animal numbers , this study is not sufficient to provide a complete developmental and reproductive toxicity profile , or estimate a safe clinical dose .
Increased incidence of mid - and late - pregnancy fetal loss was observed for the 6 mg / eye group ( 10 - fold the MRHD , on a mg / kg basis ) .
Fetal loss was not observed for the 3 mg / eye group .
Fetal malformation ( bilateral absent metatarsal ) was observed at 6 mg / eye .
VEGF inhibition has been shown to cause malformations , embryo - fetal resorption , and decreased fetal weight .
VEGF also been shown to affect follicular development , corpus luteum function , and fertility .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of brolucizumab in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant , or the effects of the drug on milk production / excretion .
Because many drugs are transferred in human milk and because of the potential for absorption and adverse reactions in the breastfed child , breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose when stopping treatment with BEOVU .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females Females of reproductive potential should use highly effective contraception ( methods that result in less than 1 % pregnancy rates ) during treatment with BEOVU and for at least one month after the last dose when stopping treatment with BEOVU .
Infertility No studies on the effects of brolucizumab on fertility have been conducted .
Based on its anti - VEGF mechanism of action , treatment with BEOVU may pose a risk to reproductive capacity .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of BEOVU in pediatric patients has not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In the two Phase 3 clinical studies in AMD , approximately 90 % ( 978 / 1089 ) of patients randomized to treatment with BEOVU were ≥ 65 years of age and approximately 60 % ( 648 / 1089 ) were ≥ 75 years of age .
In the two Phase 3 clinical studies in DME , approximately 45 % ( 164 / 368 ) of patients randomized to treatment with BEOVU were ≥ 65 years of age and approximately 10 % ( 37 / 368 ) were ≥ 75 years of age .
No significant differences in efficacy or safety were seen with increasing age in these studies .
No dosage regimen adjustment is required in patients 65 years and above .
11 DESCRIPTION Brolucizumab - dbll is a recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor .
Brolucizumab - dbll is a humanized monoclonal single - chain Fv ( scFv ) antibody fragment .
Brolucizumab - dbll has a molecular weight of ~ 26 kilodaltons and is produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology .
BEOVU ( brolucizumab - dbll ) injection is a sterile , clear to slightly opalescent , colorless to slightly brownish - yellow solution in a single - dose pre - filled syringe or a single - dose vial for intravitreal administration .
Each single - dose pre - filled syringe and vial is designed to deliver 0 . 05 mL of solution containing 6 mg brolucizumab - dbll , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 02 % ) , sodium citrate ( 10 mM ) , sucrose ( 5 . 8 % ) , and Water for Injection , USP and with a pH of approximately 7 . 2 .
This product does not contain an antimicrobial preservative .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Brolucizumab is a human VEGF inhibitor .
Brolucizumab binds to the three major isoforms of VEGF - A ( e . g . , VEGF110 , VEGF121 , and VEGF165 ) , thereby preventing interaction with receptors VEGFR - 1 and VEGFR - 2 .
By inhibiting VEGF - A , brolucizumab suppresses endothelial cell proliferation , neovascularization , and vascular permeability .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Leakage of blood and fluid from choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) may cause retinal thickening or edema .
Increased retinal thickness and accumulation of intraretinal fluid ( IRF ) / subretinal fluid ( SRF ) , assessed by optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , is associated with nAMD and DME .
Reductions in central retinal subfield thickness ( CST ) were observed across all treatment arms .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following a single intravitreal dose of BEOVU to 25 AMD patients , the mean ( range ) serum Cmax of free brolucizumab ( unbound to VEGF - A ) was 49 ng / mL ( 9 to 548 ng / mL ) and was attained at 24 hours post - dose .
Brolucizumab concentrations were near or less than 0 . 5 ng / mL ( lower limit of assay quantitation ) at approximately 4 weeks after repeat dose administration and no accumulation in serum was observed in most patients .
Elimination The estimated mean ( ± standard deviation ) systemic half - life of brolucizumab is 4 . 4 days ( ± 2 . 0 days ) after a single intravitreal dose .
Metabolism Metabolism of brolucizumab has not been fully characterized .
However , free brolucizumab is expected to undergo metabolism via proteolysis .
Excretion The excretion of brolucizumab has not been fully characterized .
However , free brolucizumab is expected to undergo target - mediated disposition and / or passive renal excretion .
Specific Populations Following repeat intravitreal dose administration of BEOVU in the HAWK and HARRIER clinical studies , no differences in the systemic pharmacokinetics of brolucizumab were observed based on age ( 50 years and above ) , sex , or mild to moderate renal impairment ( glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) = 30 to 70 mL / min , estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease ( MDRD ) equation ) .
The effect of severe renal impairment or any degree of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of BEOVU is unknown .
As significant increases in serum brolucizumab exposures are not expected with intravitreal route of administration , no dosage adjustment is needed based on renal or hepatic impairment status .
Drug Interaction Studies No studies evaluating the drug interaction potential of BEOVU have been conducted .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted on the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of BEOVU .
Based on the anti - VEGF mechanism of action , treatment with BEOVU may pose a risk to reproductive capacity [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Neovascular ( Wet ) Age - Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) The safety and efficacy of BEOVU were assessed in two randomized , multi - center , double - masked , active - controlled studies ( HAWK - NCT02307682 and HARRIER - NCT02434328 ) in patients with neovascular AMD .
A total of 1817 patients were treated in these studies for two years ( 1088 on brolucizumab and 729 on control ) .
Patient ages ranged from 50 to 97 years with a mean of 76 years .
In HAWK , patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to the following dosing regimens : 1 ) brolucizumab 3 mg administered every 8 or 12 weeks after the first 3 monthly doses , 2 ) brolucizumab 6 mg administered every 8 or 12 weeks after the first 3 monthly doses , 3 ) aflibercept 2 mg administered every 8 weeks after the first 3 monthly doses .
In HARRIER , patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to the following dosing regimens : 1 ) brolucizumab 6 mg administered every 8 or 12 weeks after the first 3 monthly doses , 2 ) aflibercept 2 mg administered every 8 weeks after the first 3 monthly doses .
In both studies , after three initial monthly doses ( week 0 , 4 , and 8 ) , treating physicians decided whether to treat each individual patient on an every 8 - week or 12 - week dosing interval guided by visual and anatomical measures of disease activity , although the utility of these measures has not been established .
Patients on 12 - week dosing intervals could be changed based on the same measures to an 8 - week schedule after subsequent treatment visits .
Any patient placed on an 8 - week schedule , remained on the 8 - week dosing interval until the end of the study .
Protocol - specified visits in the initial three months occurred every 28 ± 3 days followed by every 28 ± 7 days for the remainder of the studies .
Baseline anatomical measures may have contributed to the regimen selection because the majority of patients on the 12 - week dosing schedule at the end of the trial had less baseline macular edema and / or smaller baseline lesions .
Both studies demonstrated efficacy in the primary endpoint defined as the change from baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity ( BCVA ) at Week 48 , measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) Letter Score .
In both studies , BEOVU treated patients had a similar mean change from baseline in BCVA as the patients treated with aflibercept 2 mg ( fixed every 8 weeks ) .
Detailed results of both studies are shown in Table 2 and Figures 8 and 9 below .

The proportion of patients who were maintained on every 12 - week dosing through Week 96 was 45 % and 39 % in HAWK and HARRIER , respectively .
The probability of remaining on every 12 - week dosing from Week 20 to Week 48 was 85 % and 82 % , and from Week 48 to Week 96 was 82 % and 75 % in HAWK and HARRIER , respectively .
Treatment effects in evaluable subgroups ( e . g . , age , gender , race , baseline visual acuity ) in each study were generally consistent with the results in the overall populations .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Diabetic Macular Edema ( DME ) The safety and efficacy of BEOVU were assessed in two randomized , multi - center , double - masked , active controlled studies ( KESTREL – NCT03481634 and KITE - NCT03481660 ) in patients with DME .
A total of 926 patients were treated in these studies for 1 year ( 558 on brolucizumab and 368 on aflibercept 2 mg ) .
Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 years with a mean of 63 years .
In KESTREL , patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to the following dosing regimens : 1 ) brolucizumab 6 mg administered once every 6 weeks for first 5 doses , followed by brolucizumab 6 mg every 8 or 12 weeks .
2 ) brolucizumab 3 mg administered once every 6 weeks for first 5 doses , followed by brolucizumab 3 mg every 8 or 12 weeks .
3 ) aflibercept 2 mg administered once every 4 weeks for first 5 doses , followed by aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks .
In KITE , patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to the following dosing regimens : 1 ) brolucizumab 6 mg administered once every 6 weeks for first 5 doses , followed by brolucizumab 6 mg every 8 or 12 weeks .
2 ) aflibercept 2 mg administered once every 4 weeks for first 5 doses , followed by aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks .
In both studies , after the first five doses ( Weeks 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 ) , brolucizumab patients were treated every 12 weeks , with the option of adjusting to an every 8 week dosing interval based on disease activity .
Disease activity was assessed by changes in visual acuity and / or anatomical parameters , including CST and / or presence of IRF / SRF although the utility of the specific action parameters used has not been established .
Disease activity was assessed by a physician during the first 12 week interval ( at Weeks 32 and 36 ) and at each subsequent scheduled 12 week treatment visit .
Patients who showed disease activity at any of these visits were adjusted to an every 8 week treatment interval .
The comparator aflibercept was administered every 8 weeks after the first 5 monthly doses .
The primary efficacy endpoint for both studies was the change from baseline to Week 52 in Best Corrected Visual Acuity ( BCVA ) as measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) Letter Score with the primary objective being to demonstrate non - inferiority of BEOVU vs . aflibercept 2 mg .
In both studies , BEOVU was non - inferior to aflibercept 2 mg for the change in BCVA from baseline to Week 52 and the change from baseline over the period Week 40 through Week 52 .
After 5 initial q6w loading doses , the patients in the BEOVU arm could have received between the minimum of 2 and maximum of 3 additional injections through Week 52 .
At Week 52 , the median number of injections given over 12 months was 7 in patients treated with BEOVU .
Through Week 52 , 55 % ( KESTREL ) and 50 % ( KITE ) of patients remained on BEOVU every 12 weeks .
The probability of remaining on every 12 - week dosing from Week 36 to Week 52 was 88 % and 95 % in KESTREL and KITE , respectively .
Results of both studies are shown in Table 3 and Figures 10 and 11 below .

In both studies , BEOVU demonstrated a significant reduction from baseline in CST starting at Week 4 and continuing up to Week 52 .
