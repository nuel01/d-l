Contraindications : This product is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients ; also , all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis , hemochromatosis , or hemolytic anemias .

WARNING Accidental overdose of iron - containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 .
Keep this product out of reach of children .
In case of accidental overdose , call a doctor or poison control center immediately .
Administration of folic acid alone is improper therapy for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias in which vitamin B12 is deficient .
Precautions Folic acid in doses above 0 . 1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia , in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive .
There is a potential danger in administering folic acid to patients with undiagnosed anemia , since folic acid may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress .
This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made .
Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent , halt , or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia .
The patient ’ s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs , herbs , and / or supplements should be considered .
For use on the order of a healthcare practitioner .

Adverse Reactions : Folic Acid : Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid .
