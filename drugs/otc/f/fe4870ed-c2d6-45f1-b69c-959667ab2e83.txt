Who may use Minoxidil Topical Solution ?
Minoxidil Topical Solution may be appropriate for you if you are an adult who is at least 18 years old and experiencing gradually thinning hair or gradual hair loss on the top of the head .
The common hereditary thinning or hair loss process begins slowly and may become noticeable only after years of gradual loss .

Frontal hair growth has not been demonstrated in clinical trials .
Minoxidil Topical Solution is more likely to regrow hair in men with hair loss in the range shown below .
If men have more hair loss than shown , Minoxidil Topical Solution may not work .
Many of those experiencing hair loss have other family members with gradual thinning hair or hair loss .
If there is no family history of gradual thinning or gradual hair loss , or hair loss is patchy , talk to your doctor .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Who should NOT use Minoxidil Topical Solution ?
Minoxidil Topical Solution will not prevent or improve hair loss which may occur with the use of some prescription and non - prescription medications , certain severe nutritional problems ( very low body iron ; excessive vitamin A intake ) , low thyroid states ( hypothyroidism ) , chemotherapy , or diseases which cause scarring of the scalp .
Also , Minoxidil Topical Solution will not improve hair loss due to : • damage from the use of hair care products which cause scarring or deep burns of the scalp .
• hair grooming methods such as cornrowing or ponytails which require pulling the hair tightly back from the scalp .
You should ask your doctor if you are unsure of the cause for your hair loss .

In clinical studies of mostly white men aged 18 - 49 years with moderate degrees of hair loss , the following response of Minoxidil Topical Solution was reported : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Can Minoxidil Topical Solution be used to prevent hair loss ?
We do not know if Minoxidil Topical Solution will prevent hair loss .
How soon can I expect results from using Minoxidil Topical Solution ?
Since normal hair usually grows only ½ to 1 inch per month , hair regrowth with Minoxidil Topical Solution also takes time .
Generally new hair growth is slow for a Minoxidil Topical Solution user .
Continued use 2 times a day for at least 4 months is usually needed before you notice hair regrowth .
If you do not see hair regrowth in 4 months , stop using Minoxidil Topical Solution and see your doctor .
When you first begin to use Minoxidil Topical Solution , your hair loss may continue for up to 2 weeks .
This hair loss is temporary .
If you continue to lose hair after two weeks , see your doctor .
If Minoxidil Topical Solution is working , what will the hair look like ?
At first , hair growth may be soft , downy , colorless hairs .
After further use , the new hair should be the same color and thickness as the other hairs on your scalp .
How long do I need to use Minoxidil Topical Solution ?
If you respond to Minoxidil Topical Solution , you will need to use it 2 times a day to keep and continue the hair regrowth .
Up to 12 months of use may be needed to see your best results from Minoxidil Topical Solution .
What happens if I completely stop using Minoxidil Topical Solution ?
Will I keep the new hair ?
Continuous use of Minoxidil Topical Solution is needed to maintain hair regrowth .
If you stop using Minoxidil Topical Solution , the normal hair loss process will start again .
You will probably lose your newly regrown hair in three to four months .
What is the dosage of Minoxidil Topical Solution ?
You should apply a dose ( 1 mL ) of Minoxidil Topical Solution directly onto the scalp in the hair loss area TWO TIMES A DAY ; for example , once in the morning and once at night .
