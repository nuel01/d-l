When dosing three times weekly , the dose should be administered not more frequently than every other day .
The total weekly doses for both daily and three times a week dosage regimens are similar [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Paricalcitol capsules may be taken without regard to food .
No dosing adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment .
Initial Dose The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules for CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients is based on baseline intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) levels .
Baseline iPTH Level Daily Dose Three Times a Week Dose * 500 pg / mL 1 mcg 2 mcg > 500 pg / mL 2 mcg 4 mcg * To be administered not more often than every other day Dose Titration Dosing must be individualized and based on serum or plasma iPTH levels , with monitoring of serum calcium and serum phosphorus .
The following is a suggested approach to dose titration .
Dose Adjustment at 2 to 4 Week Intervals iPTH Level Relative to Baseline Paricalcitol Capsules Dose Daily Dose Three Times a Week Dosage * The same , increased or decreased by < 30 % Increase dose by 1 mcg 2 mcg Decreased by ≥ 30 % and ≤ 60 % Maintain dose - - Decreased by > 50 Decrease dose by 1 mcg 2 mcg * To be administered not more than every other day If a patient is taking the lowest dose , 1 mcg , on the daily regimen and a dose reduction is needed , the dose can be decreased to 1 mcg three times a week .
If a further dose reduction is required , the drug should be withheld as needed and restarted at a lower dosing frequency .
If a patient is on a calcium - based phosphate binder , the phosphate - binder dose may be decreased or withheld , or the patient may be switched to a non - calcium - based phosphate binder .
If hypercalcemia or an elevated Ca x P is observed , the dose of paricalcitol capsules should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized .
Serum calcium and phosphorus levels should be closely monitored after initiation of paricalcitol capsules , during dose titration periods and during co - administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 Paricalcitol capsules are to be administered three times a week , not more frequently than every other day .
Paricalcitol capsules may be taken without regard to food .
No dosing adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment .
Initial Dose The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules in micrograms is based on a baseline iPTH level ( pg / mL ) / 80 .
To minimize the risk of hypercalcemia patients should be treated only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9 . 5 mg / dL or lower [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Dose Titration Subsequent dosing should be individualized and based on iPTH , serum calcium and phosphorus levels .
A suggested dose titration of paricalcitol capsules is based on the following formula : Titration dose ( micrograms ) = most recent iPTH level ( pg / ml ) / 80 Serum calcium and phosphorus levels should be closely monitored after initiation , during dose titration periods , and with co - administration of strong P450 3 A inhibitors .
If an elevated serum calcium or elevated Ca x P is observed and the patient is on a calcium - based phosphate binder , the binder dose may be decreased or withheld , or the patient may be switched to a non - calcium - based phosphate binder .
If serum calcium or Ca x P are elevated , the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms lower than that calculated by the most recent iPTH / 80 .
If further adjustment is required , the dose of paricalcitol capsules should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized .
As iPTH approaches the target range , small , individualized dose adjustments may be necessary in order to achieve a stable iPTH .
In situations where monitoring of iPTH , Ca or P occurs less frequently than once per week , a more modest initial and dose titration ratio ( e . g . , iPTH / 100 ) may be warranted .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Paricalcitol capsules are available as 1 mcg , 2 mcg , and 4 mcg soft gelatin capsules .
• 1 mcg : oval , white , soft gelatin capsule imprinted with " P1 " • 2 mcg , oval , red , soft gelatin capsule imprinted with " P2 " • 4 mcg , oval , yellow , soft gelatin capsule imprinted with " P4 " Capsules : 1 mcg , 2 mcg , and 4 mcg ( 3 ) .

Evidence of hypercalcemia or vitamin D toxicity ( 4 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds , including paricalcitol capsules , can cause over suppression of PTH , hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria , hyperphosphatemia , and adynamic bone disease .
• Hypercalcemia : Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause over suppression of PTH , hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria , hyperphosphatemia , and adynamic bone disease .
Prescription - based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol capsules treatment ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Digitalis toxicity : Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause .
Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Laboratory tests : Monitor serum calcium , serum phosphorus , and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment ( 5 . 3 ) .
• Aluminum overload and toxicity : Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds ( 5 . 4 ) .
5 . 1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis .
Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft - tissue calcification .
Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium - containing preparations or thiazide diueretics with paricalcitol capsules may increase the risk of hypercalcemia .
High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration .
Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium , which include feeling tired , difficulty thinking clearly , loss of appetite , nausea , vomiting , constipation , increased thirst , increased urination and weight loss .
Prescription - based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol capsules treatment to avoid hypercalcemia .
5 . 2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause .
Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds .
5 . 3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication , serum calcium , serum phosphorus , and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months , then monthly for 3 months , and every 3 months thereafter .
5 . 4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum - containing preparations ( e . g . , antacids , phosphate binders ) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol capsules , as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur .

Use with caution ( 7 . 1 ) • Cholestyramine , Mineral Oil : Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol capsules may be reduced if administered simultaneously with mineral oil or cholestyramine ( 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 CYP3A Inhibitors Since paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A , exposure of paricalcitol will be increased while paricalcitol is co - administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors including the following drugs but not limited to : ketoconazole , atazanavir , clarithromycin , indinavir , itraconazole , nefazodone , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir , telithromycin or voriconazole .
Dose adjustment of paricalcitol capsules may be required , and iPTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Cholestyramine Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat - soluble vitamins , such as cholestyramine , may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol capsules .
7 . 3 Mineral Oil The use of mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol capsules .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C . Paricalcitol has been shown to cause minimal decreases in fetal viability ( 5 % ) when administered daily to rabbits at a dose 0 . 5 times a human dose of 14 mcg or 0 . 24 mcg / kg ( based on body surface area , mcg / m2 ) , and when administered to rats at a dose two times the 0 . 24 mcg / kg human dose ( based on body surface area , mcg / m2 ) .
At the highest dose tested , 20 mcg / kg administered three times per week in rats ( 13 times the 14 mcg human dose based on surface area , mcg / m2 ) , there was a significant increase in the mortality of newborn rats at doses that were maternally toxic and are known to produce hypercalcemia in rats .
No other effects on offspring development were observed .
Paricalcitol was not teratogenic at the doses tested .
Paricalcitol ( 20 mcg / kg ) has been shown to cross the placental barrier in rats .
There are no adequate and well - controlled clinical studies in pregnant women .
Paricalcitol capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol is present in the milk .
It is not known whether paricalcitol is excreted in human milk .
In the nursing patient , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number ( n = 220 ) of CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients in clinical studies of paricalcitol capsules , 49 % were age 65 and over , while 17 % were age 75 and over .
Of the total number ( n = 88 ) of CKD Stage 5 patients in the pivotal study of paricalcitol capsules , 28 % were age 65 and over , while 6 % were age 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria , and hyperphosphatemia , and over suppression of PTH [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Treatment of Overdosage The treatment of acute overdosage of paricalcitol capsules should consist of general supportive measures .
If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time , induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption .
If the drug has passed through the stomach , the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination .
Serial serum electrolyte determinations ( especially calcium ) , rate of urinary calcium excretion , and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained .
Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis .
Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low - calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage .
Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of paricalcitol , further measures are probably unnecessary .
If persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur , there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be considered depending on the patient ' s underlying condition .
These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids , as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis .
Paricalcitol capsules is not significantly removed by dialysis .
11 DESCRIPTION Paricalcitol , USP , the active ingredient in paricalcitol capsules , is a synthetically manufactured , metabolically active vitamin D analog of calcitriol with modifications to the side chain ( D2 ) and the A ( 19 - nor ) ring .
Paricalcitol capsules are indicated for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease .
Paricalcitol capsules are available as soft gelatin capsules for oral administration containing 1 microgram , 2 micrograms or 4 micrograms of paricalcitol .
Each capsule also contains medium chain triglycerides ( Neobee Oil M - 5 ) , ethanol , butylated hydroxytoluene , and lecithin soy .
The capsule shell is composed of ammonium hydroxide , gelatin , glycerin , macrogol ( polyethylene glycol ) , propylene glycol , polyvinyl acetate phthalate , titanium dioxide , iron oxide black , iron oxide red ( 2 microgram capsules only ) , iron oxide yellow ( 4 microgram capsules only ) , and water .
Paricalcitol is a white , crystalline powder with the empirical formula of C27H44O3 , which corresponds to a molecular weight of 416 . 64 .
Paricalcitol is chemically designated as 19 - nor - 1α , 3β , 25 - trihydroxy - 9 , 10 - secoergosta - 5 ( Z ) , 7 ( E ) , 22 ( E ) - triene and has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone .
The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D2 or D3 .
Both vitamin D2 and D3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) .
The endogenous VDR activator , calcitriol [ 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ] , is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland , intestine , kidney , and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis , and to VDRs found in many other tissues , including prostate , endothelium and immune cells .
VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone .
In the diseased kidney , the activation of vitamin D is diminished , resulting in a rise of PTH , subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis .
Decreased levels of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease .
The decreased levels of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 and resultant elevated PTH levels , both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus , affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy .
12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic , biologically active vitamin D2 analog of calcitriol .
Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol ' s biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR , which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways .
Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Paricalcitol decreases serum intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) and increases serum calcium and serum phosphorous in both HD and PD patients .
This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately .
Computer - based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients ( N = 100 ) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy ( at least two consecutive ≥ 30 % reductions from baseline iPTH ) with lower hypercalcemia rates ( at least two consecutive serum calcium ≥ 10 . 5 mg / dL ) for lower iPTH - based dosing regimens .
Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening .
Based on these simulations , a dosing regimen of iPTH / 80 with a screening serum calcium ≤ 9 . 5 mg / dL , approximately 76 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : 75 . 6 % – 77 . 3 % ) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly ≥ 30 % reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks .
The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 7 % – 1 . 0 % ) .
In PD patients , with this dosing regimen , approximately 83 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 82 . 6 % – 84 . 0 % ) of patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly ≥ 30 % reductions from baseline iPTH .
The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 12 . 4 % ( 95 % CI : 11 . 7 % - 13 . 0 % ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of paricalcitol capsules under low - fat fed condition ranged from 72 % to 86 % in healthy subjects , CKD Stage 5 patients on HD , and CKD Stage 5 patients on PD .
A food effect study in healthy subjects indicated that the Cmax and AUC0 - ∞ were unchanged when paricalcitol was administered with a high fat meal compared to fasting .
Food delayed Tmax by about 2 hours .
The AUC0 - ∞ of paricalcitol increased proportionally over the dose range of 0 . 06 to 0 . 48 mcg / kg in healthy subjects .
Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins ( ≥ 99 . 8 % ) .
The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0 . 24 mcg / kg dose of paricalcitol in healthy subjects was 34 L .
The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 4 mcg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 3 and a 3 mcg dose in CKD Stage 4 patients is between 44 and 46 L . Metabolism After oral administration of a 0 . 48 mcg / kg dose of 3 H - paricalcitol , parent drug was extensively metabolized , with only about 2 % of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces , and no parent drug was found in the urine .
Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces .
Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug .
Two minor metabolites , relative to paricalcitol , were detected in human plasma .
One metabolite was identified as 24 ( R ) - hydroxy paricalcitol , while the other metabolite was unidentified .
The 24 ( R ) - hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression .
In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non - hepatic enzymes , including mitochondrial CYP24 , as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4 .
The identified metabolites include the product of 24 ( R ) - hydroxylation , 24 , 26 - and 24 , 28 - dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation .
Elimination Paricalcitol is eliminated primarily via hepatobiliary excretion ; approximately 70 % of the radiolabeled dose is recovered in the feces and 18 % is recovered in the urine .
While the mean elimination half - life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy subjects , the mean elimination half - life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3 , 4 , and 5 ( on HD and PD ) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours .

Specific Populations Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric patients greater than 65 years [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in patients less than 18 years of age .
Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0 . 06 to 0 . 48 mcg / kg dose range was gender independent .
Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol ( 0 . 24 mcg / kg ) was compared in patients with mild ( n = 5 ) and moderate ( n = 5 ) hepatic impairment ( as indicated by the Child - Pugh method ) and subjects with normal hepatic function ( n = 10 ) .
The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study .
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment .
The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated .
Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules , the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients .
Therefore , no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 or CYP3A .
Hence , paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes .
Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole ( 40 mg capsule ) , a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19 , on paricalcitol ( four 4 mcg capsules ) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose , crossover study in healthy subjects .
The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose .
Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole , a strong inhibitor of CYP3A , administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol ( 4 mcg capsule ) has been studied in healthy subjects .
The Cmax of paricalcitol was minimally affected , but AUC0 - ∞ approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole .
The mean half - life of paricalcitol was 17 . 0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9 . 8 hours , when paricalcitol was administered alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 104 - week carcinogenicity study in CD - 1 mice , an increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma was observed at subcutaneous doses of 1 , 3 , 10 mcg / kg given three times weekly ( 2 to 15 times the AUC at a human dose of 14 mcg , equivalent to 0 . 24 mcg / kg based on AUC ) .
The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg / kg .
In a 104 - week carcinogenicity study in rats , there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0 . 15 , 0 . 5 , 1 . 5 mcg / kg ( < 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg , equivalent to 0 . 24 mcg / kg based on AUC ) .
The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol .
Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay ( Ames Assay ) , mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay ( L5178Y ) , or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay .
There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility ( male or female ) in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mcg / kg / dose ( equivalent to 13 times a human dose of 14 mcg based on surface area , mcg / m2 ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in three , 24 - week , double blind , placebo - controlled , randomized , multicenter , Phase 3 clinical studies in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients .
Two studies used an identical three times a week dosing design , and one study used a daily dosing design .
A total of 107 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 113 patients received placebo .
The mean age of the patients was 63 years , 68 % were male , 71 % were Caucasian , and 26 % were African - American .
The average baseline iPTH was 274 pg / mL ( range : 145 - 856 pg / mL ) .
The average duration of CKD prior to study entry was 5 . 7 years .
At study entry 22 % were receiving calcium based phosphate binders and / or calcium supplements .
Baseline 25 - hydroxyvitamin D levels were not measured .
The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH .
If iPTH was ≤ 500 pg / mL , paricalcitol capsules were administered 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week , not more than every other day .
If iPTH was > 500 pg / mL , paricalcitol capsules were administered 2 mcg daily or 4 mcg three times a week , not more than every other day .
The dose was increased by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week every 2 to 4 weeks until iPTH levels were reduced by at least 30 % from baseline .
The overall average weekly dose of paricalcitol capsules was 9 . 6 mcg / week in the daily regimen and 9 . 5 mcg / week in the three times a week regimen .
In the clinical studies , doses were titrated for any of the following reasons : if iPTH fell to < 60 pg / mL , or decreased > 60 % from baseline , the dose was reduced or temporarily withheld ; if iPTH decreased < 30 % from baseline and serum calcium was ≤ 10 . 3 mg / dL and serum phosphorus was ≤ 5 . 5 mg / dL , the dose was increased ; and if iPTH decreased between 30 to 60 % from baseline and serum calcium and phosphorus were ≤ 10 . 3 mg / dL and ≤ 5 . 5 mg / dL , respectively , the dose was maintained .
Additionally , if serum calcium was between 10 . 4 to 11 . 0 mg / dL , the dose was reduced irrespective of iPTH , and the dose was withheld if serum calcium was > 11 . 0 mg / dL .
If serum phosphorus was > 5 . 5 mg / dL , dietary counseling was provided , and phosphate binders could have been initiated or increased .
If the elevation persisted , the paricalcitol capsules dose was decreased .
Seventy - seven percent ( 77 % ) of the paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 82 % of the placebo treated patients completed the 24 - week treatment .
The primary efficacy endpoint of at least two consecutive ≥ 30 % reductions from baseline iPTH was achieved by 91 % of paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 13 % of the placebo treated patients ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
The proportion of paricalcitol capsules treated patients achieving two consecutive ≥ 30 % reductions was similar between the daily and the three times a week regimens ( daily : 30 / 33 , 91 % ; three times a week : 62 / 68 , 91 % ) .
The incidence of hypercalcemia ( defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10 . 5 mg / dL ) , hyperphosphatemia and elevated Ca x P product in paricalcitol capsules treated patients was similar to placebo .
There were no treatment related adverse events associated with hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in the paricalcitol capsules group .
No increases in urinary calcium or phosphorous were detected in paricalcitol capsules treated patients compared to placebo .
The pattern of change in the mean values for serum iPTH during the studies is shown in Figure 1 .

The study used a three times a week dosing design .
A total of 61 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 27 patients received placebo .
The mean age of the patients was 57 years , 67 % were male , 50 % were Caucasian , 45 % were African - American , and 53 % were diabetic .
The average baseline iPTH was 701 pg / mL ( range : 216 - 1933 pg / mL ) .
The average time since first dialysis across all subjects was 3 . 3 years .
The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH / 60 .
Subsequent dose adjustments were based on iPTH / 60 as well as primary chemistry results that were measured once a week .
Starting at Treatment Week 2 , study drug was maintained , increased or decreased weekly based on the results of the previous week ’ s calculation of iPTH / 60 .
Paricalcitol capsules were administered three times a week , not more than every other day .
The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly ≥ 30 % reductions from baseline iPTH was 88 % of paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 13 % of the placebo treated patients .
The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly ≥ 30 % reductions from baseline iPTH was similar for HD and PD patients .
The incidence of hypercalcemia ( defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10 . 5 mg / dL ) in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 6 . 6 % as compared to 0 % for patients given placebo .
In PD patients the incidence of hypercalcemia in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 21 % as compared to 0 % for patients given placebo .
The patterns of change in the mean values for serum iPTH are shown in Figure 2 .
The rate of hypercalcemia with paricalcitol capsules may be reduced with a lower dosing regimen based on the iPTH / 80 formula as shown by computer simulations .
The hypercalcemia rate can be further predicted to decrease , if the treatment is initiated in only those with baseline serum calcium ≤ 9 . 5 mg / dL [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
